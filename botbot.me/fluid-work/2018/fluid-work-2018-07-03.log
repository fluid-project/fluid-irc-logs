b'2018-07-03T14:05:54 <Bosmon> This seems to put in scope some of the functionality of the "shapshotter" which sgithens is working on
2018-07-03T14:06:03 <colinclark> right
2018-07-03T14:06:28 <Bosmon> But one would imagine, not all of it, since the act of snapshotting the ENTIRE system state is likely to be highly expensive, and not something we want to trigger without formality
2018-07-03T14:06:55 <Bosmon> So this implies that somehow the QSS needs to be able to register its interest in the small subset of settings that it happens to deal in, but without necessarily modifying their state in any way

2018-07-03T18:34:55 <Justin_o> it was mentioned on an issue for the bio-wordpress-plugin.. i wonder if it would be useful for any of your work
2018-07-03T18:35:51 * Hassany212 joined the channel
2018-07-03T18:36:01 <jhung> Justin_o: looking at it now...
2018-07-03T18:41:53 <Justin_o> jhung: also could you look at my PR to fix a typo in the wordpress plugin https://github.com/fluid-project/uio-wordpress-plugin/pull/7
2018-07-03T18:44:04 <jhung> Justin_o: that plugin isn\'t really useful in our situation because we have multiple editors, and not all of them are using github as part of their process. So there\'s a chance whenever we deploy from github we might clobber changes done in production.
2018-07-03T18:44:33 <Justin_o> ah okay..
2018-07-03T18:45:12 <jhung> @Justin_o merged your PR.
2018-07-03T18:45:27 <Justin_o> thanks, did you close the related github issue as well?
2018-07-03T18:45:47 <jhung> yep

2018-07-03T18:47:36 <Justin_o> Bosmon: do you have time tomorrow to talk over your code review comments for https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/898
2018-07-03T18:49:19 <Bosmon> Justin_o - sure

2018-07-03T18:53:28 <Justin_o> also the PR you reviewed has been extended by work in https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/903. However, it\'s likely that many of your comments are still applicable.

2018-07-03T20:36:37 <sgithens> Bosmon: What\'s the correct way to get values from a model with a change-applier-ish sort of way? (like iwth the same path syntax you\'d use for an applier.change operation)
2018-07-03T20:38:35 <sgithens> I\'ve always just fetched them from the model, but I\'m dealing with some cases were several segments of the path may not exist, and I don\'t want to check to see if they all exist, I just want to give it the path
2018-07-03T20:49:42 * the-t-in-rtf joined the channel
2018-07-03T20:52:56 <Bosmon> sgithens - you use fluid.get, right?
2018-07-03T20:55:34 <sgithens> right, I was just wondering if there was something that was already bound to the model for that component (ie. you\'re not passing the model as the first param).  So like the applier is a top level thing on the modelComponent with the set operations, and I sort of expected that it would also emcompass gets in some way

2018-07-03T09:26:44 <the-t-in-rtf> Can someone (like @stegru) talk me through how Windows knows whether JAWS is installed?  I\'m testing with JAWS 2018 and it doesn\'t change any settings.  It launches Narrator, so it seems like it knows I want a screen reader, but doesn\'t know that JAWS is installed.
2018-07-03T09:32:50 <the-t-in-rtf> OK, I found it: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L655
2018-07-03T09:35:05 <stegru> the-t-in-rtf: the "isInstalled" isn\'t used (as far as I know)
2018-07-03T09:36:25 <stegru> add the jews solution to https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/deviceReporter/installedSolutions.json
2018-07-03T09:38:09 <the-t-in-rtf> Thanks, I might add the JAWS solution instead.
2018-07-03T09:39:53 <the-t-in-rtf> Are there plans to make that check dynamic?
2018-07-03T09:40:11 <the-t-in-rtf> Or are all the solutions we\'re supporting for the AJCs on every single machine?
2018-07-03T09:42:42 <the-t-in-rtf> Also, is JAWS restarted on login/logout?
2018-07-03T09:42:46 <the-t-in-rtf> Guess I\'ll find out soon enough.
2018-07-03T09:50:24 <the-t-in-rtf> Seems like we\'re gonna have some really interesting conversations soon, there are at least two versions of JAWS, so at a minimum we need to figure out versions.
2018-07-03T09:50:40 <the-t-in-rtf> (at the AJCs, I mean)
2018-07-03T09:53:42 <stegru> those are all good questions
2018-07-03T09:59:48 <the-t-in-rtf> this is my fate, to wander down various crumbling tunnels with a lamp, and I accept it.
2018-07-03T10:00:15 <the-t-in-rtf> make a nice statue of a canary in a cage and dedicate it to me if I don\'t return.
2018-07-03T10:23:06 <the-t-in-rtf> Looks like it would start/stop it if the third version-specific setting were updated.
2018-07-03T10:23:08 <the-t-in-rtf> trying that now.
2018-07-03T10:23:56 <the-t-in-rtf> It\'s been a while since I had to use regedit.
2018-07-03T10:23:59 <the-t-in-rtf> I really haven\'t missed it.
2018-07-03T10:24:39 <the-t-in-rtf> HA!
2018-07-03T10:24:59 <the-t-in-rtf> It did launch, and JAWS immediately rebooted the machine for the 40 minute reset.
2018-07-03T10:25:42 <the-t-in-rtf> This is like that episode of BSG, "33".
2018-07-03T10:32:00 <the-t-in-rtf> OK, it starts and stops, but I get "... failure to read settings for handler gpii.launchHandlers.flexibleHandler as written after 20 retries"
2018-07-03T10:32:20 <the-t-in-rtf> And the INI file still contains the defaults.
2018-07-03T10:32:38 <the-t-in-rtf> It also has the wrong carriage return.
2018-07-03T10:33:00 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, I can look through logs, just mentioning it in case it sounds familiar.
2018-07-03T10:33:05 <the-t-in-rtf> @stegru? ^^^
2018-07-03T10:33:43 <stegru> not familiar.. i\'ve never used JAWS
2018-07-03T10:34:12 <stegru> what version are you using?
2018-07-03T10:34:20 <the-t-in-rtf> 2018, which is what some of the AJCs use.
2018-07-03T10:34:29 <the-t-in-rtf> I figured it was good to know whether it worked.
2018-07-03T10:34:55 <the-t-in-rtf> Looks like it failed to settle whether it was running or not after 20 tries.
2018-07-03T10:43:36 <the-t-in-rtf> "03:30:28.734:  Settings have not settled to required values - retrying read at attempt 16 of 20 in 1000ms

2018-07-03T10:44:00 <the-t-in-rtf> did that come through?
2018-07-03T10:44:13 <the-t-in-rtf> I got a message from the IRC server about "flooding" and "throttling".
2018-07-03T10:45:41 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, it launches it, it just never figures that out.
2018-07-03T10:45:56 <the-t-in-rtf> Looking at ReadWrite, seems like the retries is set higher.
2018-07-03T10:46:08 <the-t-in-rtf> @stegru, what\'s a good example of something you test often that works?
2018-07-03T10:46:49 <stegru> on screen keyboard
2018-07-03T10:47:31 <stegru> because it\'s fairly inert
2018-07-03T10:48:33 <stegru> i think jaws 18 is the one that\'s known to work, not 2018 (they started using years this year)
2018-07-03T10:49:15 <the-t-in-rtf> Sucks to be us, then, because I know 1-2 of the AJCs already using 2018.
2018-07-03T10:49:34 <the-t-in-rtf> we will probably have to test it with both.
2018-07-03T10:49:49 <stegru> yes definitely
2018-07-03T10:50:21 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, is there anything you test with that has to restart manually, and which uses the flexible launch handler?
2018-07-03T10:50:42 <the-t-in-rtf> the on screen keyboard is live and uses another launch handler.
2018-07-03T10:51:01 <the-t-in-rtf> I\'d like to compare non-flaming apples to flaming apples.
2018-07-03T10:51:43 <stegru> nvda
2018-07-03T10:51:58 <the-t-in-rtf> great, thanks.
2018-07-03T10:54:29 <the-t-in-rtf> I don\'t see any data sets in universal that have actual settings for NVDA beyond launching it.
2018-07-03T10:54:41 <the-t-in-rtf> but I guess launching it is enough.
2018-07-03T10:55:39 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, @stegru, which preference set do you use to test NVDA?
2018-07-03T10:55:42 <stegru> it looks like the user "chris" does
2018-07-03T10:56:07 <the-t-in-rtf> OK, I\'ll try that one.
2018-07-03T10:57:01 <the-t-in-rtf> Nope.
2018-07-03T10:57:09 <the-t-in-rtf> It has a priority for it, but JAWS is still launched.
2018-07-03T10:57:31 <the-t-in-rtf> I may have to make a similar check for locations, etc. for NVDA, I just used the one that\'s available on chocolatey.
2018-07-03T10:59:09 <stegru> you\'ll need to enable it in installedSolutions.json
2018-07-03T10:59:27 <stegru> brb, i need to nip out for 20 mins
2018-07-03T11:05:31 <the-t-in-rtf> So, for when you get back, @stegru.
2018-07-03T11:05:41 <the-t-in-rtf> If you don\'t ever test JAWS, how do you know the prioritisation still works?
2018-07-03T11:05:59 <the-t-in-rtf> I mean, I have NVDA in my solutions and Chris has it as a priority, but JAWS is still launched.
2018-07-03T11:28:49 <stegru> i don\'t know
2018-07-03T11:29:35 <the-t-in-rtf> Even with JAWS uninstalled it doesn\'t pick up on the fact that NVDA is available.
2018-07-03T11:29:38 <the-t-in-rtf> Checking those settings now.
2018-07-03T11:30:10 <stegru> and nvda solution is in installedSolutions.json?
2018-07-03T11:33:33 <the-t-in-rtf> yup.
2018-07-03T11:33:42 <the-t-in-rtf> And I refreshed the pouch instance\'s data.
2018-07-03T11:34:14 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, @stegru, you\'re welcome to join us in my Vidyo room, @Bosmon and @sgithens and I were going to meet shortly about schemas and the SR data.

2018-07-03T12:40:47 <stegru> by the way the-t-in-rtf, you might be pleased to hear that the webstorm EAP has json5 support
2018-07-03T12:40:56 <the-t-in-rtf> OOOH.
2018-07-03T12:40:59 <the-t-in-rtf> That\'s great.
2018-07-03T12:41:09 <stegru> it\'s amazing
2018-07-03T12:41:10 <the-t-in-rtf> Do you actually use it, or just reading news?
2018-07-03T12:41:13 <the-t-in-rtf> ah, great.
2018-07-03T12:41:15 <stegru> yes i use it
2018-07-03T12:45:59 <the-t-in-rtf> Oh, that\'s loads better.
2018-07-03T12:46:10 <the-t-in-rtf> I couldn\'t even find the damned scroll control amidst all the warnings previously.
2018-07-03T12:46:28 <the-t-in-rtf> thanks!
2018-07-03T12:51:40 <the-t-in-rtf> spoke too soon, it still plasters warnings all over json5 files.
2018-07-03T12:51:46 <the-t-in-rtf> Did you have to do anything special?
2018-07-03T12:58:26 <stegru> oh yes, the-t-in-rtf
2018-07-03T12:58:41 <stegru> remove the file association of json5, if you did that
2018-07-03T13:00:42 <stegru> in Editor->File Types settings, remove *.json5 from "JSON", and make sure it\'s in "JSON5"

2018-07-03T13:52:49 <jhernandez_> stegru, the-t-in-rtf: FYI, we do use the isInstalled block in the installers we deliver - so we do use the dynamic device reporter
2018-07-03T13:53:08 <jhernandez_> also, the problem we have with JAWS 18 is well known
2018-07-03T13:53:18 <stegru> oh right thanks jk
2018-07-03T13:53:21 <stegru> jh
2018-07-03T13:53:37 <jhernandez_> that\'s why we asked the NOVA it staff for the versions of JAWS they use
2018-07-03T13:54:58 <jhernandez_> IIRC, they mention that they have an old version of JAWS, but can\'t remember exactly which one
2018-07-03T13:55:01 * Guest15489 is now known as g2szeto
2018-07-03T13:57:10 <jhernandez_> and regarding the support for  different versions of an AT, there\'s a JIRA https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-111
2018-07-03T13:57:31 * clown1 joined the channel
2018-07-03T13:57:41 <jhernandez_> until we have this implemented, we need to know exactly the version of JAWS - :/

2018-07-03T13:58:27 <colinclark> Bosmon: Tell me about supporting the QSS...
2018-07-03T13:58:42 <colinclark> What kinds of things are required to enable the ability to use the QSS without first keying in?
2018-07-03T13:59:17 * clown has quit
2018-07-03T13:59:31 <Bosmon> colinclark - at the very bare minimum, there needs to be a "GPII session" open which will respond to requests to change settings
2018-07-03T13:59:57 <colinclark> a scope for changes
2018-07-03T14:00:10 <colinclark> which isn\'t a key-in
2018-07-03T14:00:17 <Bosmon> I\'ve written up some of this under https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3088
2018-07-03T14:00:42 <Bosmon> The "simplest possible change that could work" would be to create a special "noUser" session which gets keyed in the moment the GPII starts up
2018-07-03T14:01:01 <Bosmon> And which gets keyed out in the usual way whenever there is a "real" keyin
2018-07-03T14:01:14 <Bosmon> But then also gets re-keyed in once all other users are logged out
2018-07-03T14:02:31 <Bosmon> And then we would "fix" the overall system that it continued to give the same reports about login state as it used to, that is, this session is invisible to the exposed API of the FlowManager endpoints - of which we really only have one
2018-07-03T14:02:56 <Bosmon> Although I think there will be a compatibility issue with the PSP which does use the session state itself in order to set its visual state, so that will need to be upgraded
2018-07-03T14:03:34 <Bosmon> But at a wider level, there will need to be more fundamental changes to support the QSS, since we will have to somehow arrange for settings to be read from the system separately from the process of writing them
2018-07-03T14:03:52 <Bosmon> At present we only make use of the "read after write" facility of settings handlers to read a setting as part of the act of writing it
2018-07-03T14:04:06 <Bosmon> But the QSS needs to be able to track the state of all settings which it could modify at all times
2018-07-03T14:05:45 <colinclark> ah, wow, that\'s an interesting issue
