2018-02-01T11:04:09 <stegru> amatas, gtirloni: I\'m working on the spec for IoD.. it needs a server on-site - I\'m aiming for Fedora, but do you suggest anything else instead?
2018-02-01T11:04:40 <gtirloni> i\'d suggest CentOS if possible
2018-02-01T11:04:46 <gtirloni> RHEL/CentOS
2018-02-01T11:04:52 <amatas[m]> Centos is lighter
2018-02-01T11:05:08 <stegru> oh ok, good job i asked
2018-02-01T11:05:47 <amatas[m]> I guess that with centos and the gpii containers should be enough
2018-02-01T11:06:00 <stegru> is there any ready made vagrant boxes with this?
2018-02-01T11:06:22 <stegru> it\'s not running GPII.. it will just be a repo+site
2018-02-01T11:08:45 <amatas[m]> https://github.com/GPII/universal/tree/master/vagrant-configs
2018-02-01T11:09:16 <stegru> nice one
2018-02-01T11:09:44 <amatas[m]> I think that this spins up a complete server environment. But I don\'t know if it works jet
2018-02-01T11:09:50 <stegru> btw, they originally wanted Windows (with sql server). you can thank me later ;)
2018-02-01T11:10:38 * yzen_ joined the channel
2018-02-01T11:10:38 <amatas[m]> I don\'t know if there is something similar that uses the current containers that we use at the cloud

2018-02-01T11:24:45 <gtirloni> what will be running on it?
2018-02-01T11:24:50 <gtirloni> (on the linux vm)
2018-02-01T11:26:37 <stegru> it will be a REST API and an admin web-portal - nothing else
2018-02-01T11:26:42 <gtirloni> node.js?
2018-02-01T11:27:25 <gtirloni> i\'m asking because, since they are win devs, maybe they want to play with .net core on linxu.. and about that, i don\'t know if centos is a good target
2018-02-01T11:27:33 <stegru> yes, exactly
2018-02-01T11:27:36 <gtirloni> ok
2018-02-01T11:27:38 <stegru> my requirement is "Node.js is preferred, as it matches the rest of our architecture. .NET Core (on Linux) is acceptable, if there\xe2\x80\x99s a compelling reason"
2018-02-01T11:28:09 <gtirloni> so running a real server on-site with centos (or debian, or ubuntu lts) should be fine, in that order (imho) :)
2018-02-01T11:28:16 <stegru> they need to be windows guys for the client (it\'s non-trivial windows)
2018-02-01T11:28:57 <gtirloni> cool
2018-02-01T11:29:13 <stegru> ok.. i made a proof of concept on fedora 27, i expect centos should be roughly the same
2018-02-01T11:37:50 <gtirloni> i sent an email to the arch list but i\'m not seeing it in the archives, i wonder if you guys got it
2018-02-01T11:38:10 <gtirloni> stegru: should be roughly the same, when it comes to node.js yeah
2018-02-01T11:38:55 <stegru> gtirloni:  about the windows build? yes
2018-02-01T11:39:05 <gtirloni> for a real server, centos and fedora will be very similar... the biggest difference is that fedora has a 6-month release cycle and only support n-1 release with security fixes whereas centos has a very long support cycle
2018-02-01T11:39:11 <gtirloni> stegru: cool, thanks
2018-02-01T11:40:31 <stegru> oh! yes, longer the better
2018-02-01T11:41:11 <stegru> and it\'s not often i say that, to an attractive guy
2018-02-01T11:47:45 <gtirloni> LOL
2018-02-01T12:09:37 <stegru> fyi, I got .net working on centos7

2018-02-01T12:10:53 <gtirloni> awesome

2018-02-01T15:11:56 <Justin_o> jhung: thanks, also did you have a chance to look at my PR for infusion-icons?
2018-02-01T15:12:08 <jhung> Justin_o: that\'s on my todo today.

I had mentioned on the e-mail thread that I\'d like to keep it in the same repo, but it just occurred to me that this would likely cause a problem for npm installing dependencies because the workflow requires grunt
