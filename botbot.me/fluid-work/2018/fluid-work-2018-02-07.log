2018-02-07T10:30:51 <kasparnet> hey yuriy__ sure
2018-02-07T10:31:07 <kasparnet> It used to be open for everyone to sign up, but I guess it was disabled due to spam
2018-02-07T10:31:24 <yuriy__> yes, I could only see the login option
2018-02-07T10:31:44 <kasparnet> if you send me the name/email pairs for the people that I should add in a private message, I\'ll create the accounts with temporary password

2018-02-07T15:14:28 <kasparnet_> hey there Bosmon
2018-02-07T15:16:55 <Bosmon> Hey there kasparnet_
2018-02-07T15:18:00 <kasparnet_> I was so close to doing a kasper and disappear, but giant letters across my screen notifying me of your pong screwed it up
2018-02-07T15:19:16 <kasparnet_> Bosmon, I just found out that this test is not run, when triggered via all-tests
2018-02-07T15:19:16 <kasparnet_> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/tests/MultiSettingsHandlerTests.js
2018-02-07T15:19:29 <kasparnet_> despite being listed here: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/tests/all-tests.js
2018-02-07T15:19:50 <kasparnet_> it _does_ however work when running it individually
2018-02-07T15:22:50 <Bosmon> "is not run"?!
2018-02-07T15:23:50 <kasparnet_> 16:23:41.535:  jq: Failure in fixture file - no tests were queued - FAIL
2018-02-07T15:24:07 <kasparnet_> when running all-tests with everything but that test commented out
2018-02-07T15:24:29 <kasparnet_> I guess it might be a timing/queueing thing
2018-02-07T15:24:44 <Bosmon> That\'s probably the standard QUnit startup problem
2018-02-07T15:24:59 <Bosmon> That if a test file doesn\'t do anything within 13ms, QUnit assumes that it is dead
2018-02-07T15:25:24 <kasparnet_> ugh
2018-02-07T15:25:55 <kasparnet_> do you remember if there is a quick workaround for it?
2018-02-07T15:29:24 <Bosmon> Not particularly quick
2018-02-07T15:29:39 <Bosmon> You need to restructure the test fixture file so it doesn\'t wait for anything asynchronous before it queues a test
2018-02-07T15:29:48 <Bosmon> Which implies moving the asynchronous activity into the inside of the test
2018-02-07T15:30:48 <kasparnet_> ok, I\'ll give that a go! Thanks antwarnique

2018-02-07T17:18:05 <jhung> Sure no prob Justin_o. That will give me time to work on other things.

2018-02-07T18:51:59 <gtirloni> has anyone been experimenting with headless firefox/chrome? i\'m wondering if the time is right to get tests running on them
2018-02-07T19:03:27 <Justin_o> gtirloni: maybe the-t-in-rtf
2018-02-07T19:08:48 * danayo joined the channel
2018-02-07T19:14:48 <the-t-in-rtf> Chrome works decently and is supported through gpii-webdriver.
2018-02-07T19:14:57 <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. you can run tests just by passing HJEA
2018-02-07T19:15:01 <the-t-in-rtf> HEADLESS=true
2018-02-07T19:15:26 <the-t-in-rtf> Firefox doesn\'t even work in headed mode with gpii-webdriver (problems clicking things).
2018-02-07T19:15:32 <the-t-in-rtf> I did try headless, but didn\'t get far.
2018-02-07T19:15:51 <the-t-in-rtf> It\'s definitely faster.

2018-02-07T21:44:59 <Justin_o> does that mean my model has a single value?
2018-02-07T21:45:32 <Justin_o> and that\'s why the change map doesn\'t take the form of an object of values
