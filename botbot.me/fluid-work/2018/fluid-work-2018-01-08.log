2018-01-08T19:47:25 <danayo> grrrero, alanharnum: I added some content to the bottom of the google doc - a summary of our work at IDRC.
2018-01-08T19:47:41 <danayo> could you take a quick look at it alanharnum ?
2018-01-08T19:48:51 <alanharnum> danayo: having a look now, going to add a little content if that\'s OK
2018-01-08T19:52:50 <grrrero> alanharnum: I\'m also noticing the css isn\'t updated
2018-01-08T19:53:06 <grrrero> Did it not go thru in the PR?

2018-01-08T20:13:00 <grrrero> Let me know if you or danayo have any more changes I can slip into the next PR alanharnum
2018-01-08T20:13:29 <alanharnum> grrrero: give me ten to look at the content and make some revisions to danayo\'s text
2018-01-08T20:13:37 <grrrero> Alrighty alanharnum
2018-01-08T20:18:48 <danayo> grrrero: if possible could you add the background colour (the alternate blocks of grey)? I think it helps to break up the text
2018-01-08T20:19:01 <grrrero> danayo: Yep I did do that
2018-01-08T20:19:04 <grrrero> Try to reload?

2018-01-08T21:36:31 <alanharnum> would like to get our activity up before JT\'s meeting tomorrow & not sure when that is
2018-01-08T21:36:34 <grrrero> Is the current description of the IDRC in the Google Docs good to go tho?

2018-01-08T14:49:20 <michelled> I believe that gmoss has already reviewed it

2018-01-08T14:49:53 <alanharnum> michelled: sure thing, will have a look ASAP
2018-01-08T14:50:04 <michelled> Jutta will be talking to Dana from Oak tomorrow, so we are hoping to get a few little updates done before that

2018-01-08T19:40:05 <alanharnum> grrrero: merged and deployed, but looks like some issues with the unicode for the Spanish-language accents in the deployed environment: https://sojustrepairit.org/activity.html - can you replace those with HTML encoded instead & make another PR?
2018-01-08T19:40:53 <alanharnum> the Partners page should have the partner names with HTML encoding
