b'2018-10-19T15:30:58 <jhernandez> xDDD
2018-10-19T15:31:01 <jhernandez> well, kinda
2018-10-19T15:31:03 <jhernandez> ;P
2018-10-19T15:31:10 <stegru> the logs don\'t lie
2018-10-19T15:31:17 <jhernandez> stegru: how about the meetrics?
2018-10-19T15:31:30 <stegru> what about them?
2018-10-19T15:31:36 <jhernandez> shouldn\'t we get a message indicating such setting change?
2018-10-19T15:32:08 <stegru> no, it just logs applied solutions
2018-10-19T15:33:09 <cindyli> stegru, jhernandez, see line 808-817 in https://pastebin.com/ygWBbjS1. only the setting for "HighContrastOn" is applied
2018-10-19T15:33:23 <cindyli> not "LastHighContrastTheme"
2018-10-19T15:33:45 * alanharnum joined the channel
2018-10-19T15:34:57 <cindyli> stegru: is it that "LastHighContrastTheme" should be applied first, then applying "HighContrastOn": true will restore to the LastHighContrastTheme
2018-10-19T15:37:10 <stegru> yes
2018-10-19T15:41:24 <cindyli> i will debug
2018-10-19T15:47:05 <jhernandez> cindyli: yes, that\'s coming from the spi settings handler, probably the registry settings handler doesn\'t do such thing
2018-10-19T15:47:54 <jhernandez> (print the settings being applied)
2018-10-19T15:48:15 <stegru> how do i perform a reset?
2018-10-19T15:48:31 <stegru> I have the 3461 branch
2018-10-19T15:49:36 <jhernandez> stegru: I\'m testing that from gpii-app, not universal
2018-10-19T15:49:51 <stegru> damn
2018-10-19T15:49:51 <cindyli> stegru: use gpii-app ajc3 branch and run "npm start"
2018-10-19T15:50:04 <stegru> I hate debugging in gpii-app
2018-10-19T15:50:06 <cindyli> i\'m testing from gpii-app too because you must have windows
2018-10-19T15:52:44 <jhernandez> stegru: then, copy the defaultSettings.win32.json5 from the GPII-3461 branch into C:/Users/YOUR_USER/AppData/Roaming/gpii/defaultSettings.json
2018-10-19T15:53:29 <jhernandez> and remember to enable the highContrast by adding "true" to highContrastOn value
2018-10-19T15:54:14 <stegru> by the way, you can just say "%appdata%/gpii"
2018-10-19T15:54:36 <jhernandez> you may also want to set the GPII_CLOUD_URL to https://flowmanager.prd.gpii.net
2018-10-19T15:54:58 <jhernandez> stegru: right, %appdata%
2018-10-19T15:59:33 <jhernandez> oh, and remember that the GPII_CLOUD_URL is an env variable
2018-10-19T16:00:16 * michelled has quit
2018-10-19T16:15:09 <jhernandez> cindyli, Bosmon: found another thing. currently, there are some gaps in the user experience when using the "reset to std" functionality. The qss doesn\'t set the controls to the expected values after a reset action, even after setting the defaults in the qss side and according to the required standard configuration indicated via defaultSettings.json (the reset snapshot)
2018-10-19T16:18:55 <cindyli> jhernandez: this is probably because "reset to std" resets the system using settings handlers directly and doesn\'t send instructions to QSS with common terms that QSS understands, such as "http://registry\\\\.gpii\\\\.net/common/highContrastTheme"
2018-10-19T16:20:59 <cindyli> stegru, jhernandez, i found the problem with jhernandez\'s pull request to set initial high contrast, you guys can stop debugging, i will send a pull request to jhernandez\'s branch soon
2018-10-19T16:21:17 <jhernandez> I see - then looks like we need some time to figure out this one
2018-10-19T16:21:28 <jhernandez> cindyli: oooh, sweet cindyli !!
2018-10-19T16:21:41 <stegru> good, couldn\'t get the damn thing to run

2018-10-19T16:31:05 <cindyli> jhernandez: here it is - https://github.com/javihernandez/universal/pull/26
2018-10-19T16:32:04 <cindyli> to test, don\'t forget to turn on "HighContrastOn" at line 102 in defaultSettings.json5. it\'s turned off by default
2018-10-19T16:32:33 <jhernandez> ohh, wrong indent level?
2018-10-19T16:32:42 <cindyli> exactly. what a smart mistake
2018-10-19T16:32:52 <cindyli> i tried hard i believe ;)
2018-10-19T16:32:57 <cindyli> i -> you
2018-10-19T16:33:00 <cindyli> you tried hard
2018-10-19T16:36:43 <jhernandez> my bad

2018-10-19T16:38:03 * jhernandez looking for something hard to hit his head with
2018-10-19T16:38:05 <jhernandez> xD
2018-10-19T16:40:34 <cindyli> nah, it\'s ok. we all make this kind of mistakes 8-|
2018-10-19T16:44:02 <jhernandez> cindyli: okay, now I see https://paste.gnome.org/pksu8jkdq
2018-10-19T16:45:00 <jhernandez> but the system\'s not applying the hc1 high contrast theme
2018-10-19T16:45:06 <jhernandez> :/
2018-10-19T16:46:43 <jhernandez> at this point, I\'d say that probably it\'s stegru\'s laser eye the one who can help us on this
2018-10-19T16:47:29 * alanharnum joined the channel
2018-10-19T16:52:14 <jhernandez> stegru: what\'s the difference between CurrentTheme and LastHighContrastTheme?
2018-10-19T16:52:20 <jhernandez> should we set both?
2018-10-19T16:52:57 <cindyli> i tested with "LastHighContrastTheme": "C:\\\\Windows\\\\resources\\\\Ease of Access Themes\\\\hcblack.theme
2018-10-19T16:52:59 <cindyli> it works ok
2018-10-19T16:53:21 <cindyli> jhernandez: do you mean it doesn\'t work with "hc1.theme"?
2018-10-19T16:53:35 <cindyli> did you set "HighContrastOn" to true?
2018-10-19T16:53:39 <jhernandez> yup, at least not for me
2018-10-19T16:53:44 <jhernandez> yes
2018-10-19T16:53:46 <cindyli> ok
2018-10-19T16:53:47 <jhernandez> let me try with hcblack
2018-10-19T16:56:53 <jhernandez> nope, after checking the registry keys, LastHighContrastTheme is "hcblack" and CurrentTheme is "hcwhite" and this last one is the theme currently applied
2018-10-19T16:58:50 <cindyli> jhernandez: which theme do you wanna apply? hcblack or hcwhite? what\'s set in "LastHighContrastTheme" and which one gets applied?
2018-10-19T16:59:07 <cindyli> i mean "LastHighContrastTheme" in defaultSettings.json5
2018-10-19T17:00:01 <jhernandez> I want to apply hcblack - this is what I put in the defaultSettings file
2018-10-19T17:00:14 <jhernandez> and the one applied is hcwhite
2018-10-19T17:02:50 <cindyli> i see. not sure where { CurrentTheme: "hcwhite" } comes from. pass it one to stegru
2018-10-19T17:02:55 <cindyli> one -> on

2018-10-19T17:32:44 <jhernandez> as I said in the description, this needs to run through UX anyway
2018-10-19T17:33:48 <jhernandez> I have to leave in a few minutes
2018-10-19T17:37:05 <jhernandez> I\'ll wait for Bosmon\'s advice on GPII-3460 - if nothing against, I\'ll ship it into gpii-app/ajc3
2018-10-19T17:38:56 <jhernandez> cindyli: regarding the highContrast theme thing, I can just don\'t ship it as part of the installer
2018-10-19T17:38:58 <Bosmon> jhernandez - 3406?
2018-10-19T17:40:15 <Bosmon> Oh I see, 3460
2018-10-19T17:40:22 <Bosmon> But I see no pull for that yet
2018-10-19T17:40:34 <jhernandez> and tell the people how to grab the defaultSettings.json file from my pr and put it into their Roaming/gpii folders
2018-10-19T17:40:44 <jhernandez> Bosmon: heh, no pull
2018-10-19T17:40:54 <jhernandez> the jira

2018-10-19T17:41:21 <Bosmon> jhernandez - your fix is fine and certainly gpii-app should ignore restore
2018-10-19T17:41:44 <jhernandez> ok
2018-10-19T17:42:29 <Bosmon> And yes, we should try to hide the restore user from external APIs in the future
2018-10-19T17:42:35 <jhernandez> thanks, will ship it into gpii-app/ajc3, so will see if CI complains about it
2018-10-19T17:42:46 <Bosmon> jhernandez - awesome, thanks

2018-10-19T08:50:24 <the-t-in-rtf> the trick is that one of us has to go in with him, so I need to also find one for myself.
2018-10-19T08:51:15 <the-t-in-rtf> oh, right, I just remembered there are clubs that hire them out.
2018-10-19T08:51:21 <the-t-in-rtf> that\'s the way to start

2018-10-19T10:10:36 <dandimitrov> Bosmon: Just a quick question - am I correct in assuming that we have both \xe2\x80\x9crestore\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9creset\xe2\x80\x9d users?
2018-10-19T10:18:26 <jhernandez> dandimitrov: yeah, I think that "restore" is used when restoring a journal, which is what we\'re doing with "reset to std"
2018-10-19T10:19:48 <jhernandez> let\'s see what Bosmon and/or Cindyli can tell us about that
2018-10-19T10:19:54 <jhernandez> and where\'s the problem
2018-10-19T10:19:56 <jhernandez> :/
2018-10-19T10:24:33 <dandimitrov> jhernandez: it is strange that the \xe2\x80\x9creset\xe2\x80\x9d user doesn\xe2\x80\x99t stay keyed in and that should be why there isn\xe2\x80\x99t such a problem when reseting the from the gpii-app
2018-10-19T10:29:43 <jhernandez> yeah, I guess that the PSP never receives a notification about the user "reset" because it\'s a special key-in that is treated in a different way internally and doesn\'t produce the regular events in gpii-app ide
2018-10-19T10:29:48 <jhernandez> *side
2018-10-19T10:31:23 <jhernandez> but looks like we\'re getting the events when restoring a journal, and I don\'t know exactly whether this is right or not, whether gpii-app needs to handle such special keyed-in user

2018-10-19T14:36:48 * dandimitrov joined the channel
2018-10-19T14:36:49 <the-t-in-rtf> that doesn\'t look right.
2018-10-19T14:36:53 <jhernandez> better this one, https://gist.github.com/cindyli/7c4c1fcd007076a61d4544abd21cd045#file-defaultsettings-json5-to-set-initial-high-contrast-L102
2018-10-19T14:36:57 <the-t-in-rtf> shouldn\'t it be supportedSettings?
2018-10-19T14:37:35 <jhernandez> cindyli: where is the term HighContrastTheme coming from?
2018-10-19T14:37:36 <the-t-in-rtf> nm
2018-10-19T14:37:42 <the-t-in-rtf> thought we were looking at solutions data for a second
2018-10-19T14:37:46 <the-t-in-rtf> I\'m staring at it
2018-10-19T14:38:04 <jhernandez> the-t-in-rtf: nop, it\'s not solutions data
2018-10-19T14:38:13 * dandimitrov has quit
2018-10-19T14:38:32 <the-t-in-rtf> anyway, I can answer that!
2018-10-19T14:38:34 <the-t-in-rtf> just a sec
2018-10-19T14:38:43 <jhernandez> it\'s the format for this https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/17636563384a1c41e63497d0ac24fb1c8f64a0f6/documentation/ResetComputer.md
2018-10-19T14:38:46 <jhernandez> the-t-in-rtf: ^
2018-10-19T14:38:54 <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/ontologies/flat.json5#L126
2018-10-19T14:39:26 <the-t-in-rtf> the case is wrong, though.
2018-10-19T14:39:30 <jhernandez> the-t-in-rtf: yeah, that\'s the generic term, but note highContrastTheme vs HighContrastTheme
2018-10-19T14:39:37 <the-t-in-rtf> yeah.
2018-10-19T14:39:58 <jhernandez> but I thought the reset to computer file format was taking app-specific rather than generic
2018-10-19T14:40:25 <the-t-in-rtf> I dunno, your example has confused me hugely
2018-10-19T14:40:29 <the-t-in-rtf> it looks like a solutions entry!
2018-10-19T14:40:39 <the-t-in-rtf> I mean, the docs are not at all like what you shared.
2018-10-19T14:40:48 <jhernandez> at least, what I included in https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/693 is what I got after taking the data from a journal file
2018-10-19T14:41:02 <the-t-in-rtf> (I mean the reset computer docs)
2018-10-19T14:41:32 <the-t-in-rtf> anyway, I\'ll sit on my hands and wait for the answer, I\'m curious
2018-10-19T14:42:36 * dandimitrov joined the channel

2018-10-19T14:44:13 <cindyli> jhernandez: digging out where i learnt "HighContrastTheme" - https://gist.github.com/cindyli/7c4c1fcd007076a61d4544abd21cd045#file-defaultsettings-json5-to-set-initial-high-contrast-L102

2018-10-19T14:45:01 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf, jhernandez - it looks a bit like "solutions data" since the snapshot format is simply a complete settingsHandler payload
2018-10-19T14:45:13 <Bosmon> Which, minus the transformation, looks exactly like such a block within a solutions entry
2018-10-19T14:45:25 * jhernandez nods

2018-10-19T14:47:43 <jhernandez> xDD
2018-10-19T14:48:08 <cindyli> looks to me modifying high contrast must use "configure-spi" block - https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L4735, so adding back "configure-registry" at line 4797 would be useless
2018-10-19T14:49:23 <cindyli> stegru or Bosmon might have insights on whether "HighContrastTheme" should be added in "configure-spi.supportedSettings" block. right now it only has "HighContrastOn" as the supported setting - https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L4748
2018-10-19T14:50:30 <cindyli> or if it\'s still correct to use this 6 years old way ;)
2018-10-19T14:52:42 <Bosmon> I\'m a bit lost.... don\'t the instructions that the QSS already issues over the PSP bus do this correctly? : P
2018-10-19T14:53:00 <jhernandez> IIRC, the reason for having separate configure-spi and configure-registry is because these use different settings handlers
2018-10-19T14:53:06 <stegru> the configure-spi is all that\'s required to enable high-contrast.. the other blocks are for the high-contrast theme
2018-10-19T14:54:04 <stegru> "settings.configure-registry", and the little function call, set the theme
2018-10-19T14:54:19 <jhernandez> and about that 6-years old, I think we need to revisit it
2018-10-19T14:54:49 <jhernandez> stegru: yeah, and that\'s what I want, to set a highContrastTheme as part of the "reset to std" process
2018-10-19T14:54:50 <stegru> why? this function call probably hasn\'t changed since the 90s
2018-10-19T14:55:05 <stegru> oh ok
2018-10-19T14:55:08 <jhernandez> xDD
2018-10-19T14:56:25 <jhernandez> and the funny thing about the 6-years old code is that it sets a setting "HighContrastTheme" with a value "High Contrast Black", which doesn\'t correspond to anything at this moment
2018-10-19T14:56:48 <jhernandez> the setting is called "LastHighContrastTheme" and "High Contrast Black" doesn\'t seem to be a valid value to me
2018-10-19T14:57:22 <jhernandez> do you see now what I mean?
2018-10-19T14:57:27 <stegru> yes
2018-10-19T14:58:01 <stegru> this is what it sets: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/desktop/api/winuser/ns-winuser-taghighcontrasta
2018-10-19T14:58:32 <stegru> the lpszDefaultScheme member.. but I don\'t think it\'s used anymore
2018-10-19T14:59:16 <cindyli> stegru: how to use "settings.configure-registry" to set the initial high contrast theme?
2018-10-19T14:59:24 <cindyli> shall i try
2018-10-19T14:59:24 <cindyli> {
2018-10-19T14:59:25 <cindyli> settings: {
2018-10-19T14:59:25 <cindyli> LastHighContrastTheme: "%SystemRoot%\\\\resources\\\\Ease of Access Themes\\\\hcblack.theme"
2018-10-19T14:59:25 <cindyli> }
2018-10-19T14:59:25 <cindyli> }
2018-10-19T14:59:41 <jhernandez> yup, this is what I made in my pr, right?
2018-10-19T14:59:48 <stegru> maybe
2018-10-19T15:00:02 <cindyli> jhernandez: does it work? seems no, right?
2018-10-19T15:00:08 <jhernandez> https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/693
2018-10-19T15:00:17 <jhernandez> no it does not work
2018-10-19T15:01:15 <cindyli> ok
2018-10-19T15:02:40 <stegru> what is it you\'re trying to do? turn off high-contrast and set the theme to the default?
2018-10-19T15:03:25 <cindyli> stegru: what jhernandez wants to do is to set the initial default high contrast to a specific one on system startup via defaultSettings.json5
2018-10-19T15:03:46 <cindyli> i drafted this settings block that works - https://gist.github.com/cindyli/7c4c1fcd007076a61d4544abd21cd045#file-defaultsettings-json5-to-set-initial-high-contrast-L97-L106
2018-10-19T15:04:34 <cindyli> but it looks weird with the use of "HighContrastTheme" at line 102 which is not a supported setting in the "supportedSettings" block, and with a weird value "High Contrast Black" at line 103
2018-10-19T15:04:50 <stegru> "a specific one" - do you mean whatever it was set to when you first use it?
2018-10-19T15:05:11 <cindyli> when you start QSS
2018-10-19T15:05:19 <stegru> oh ok
2018-10-19T15:07:07 <stegru> setting the theme was very awkward, because the setting is the translated name of the theme
2018-10-19T15:07:56 <stegru> the setting is actually stored here: Control Panel\\Accessibility\\HighContrast@High Contrast Scheme
2018-10-19T15:09:25 <stegru> javi\'s PR looks like it worked, but what did it do?
2018-10-19T15:09:32 <cindyli> hopefully all these awkwardness will go away once we can support applying default settings through a prefs set, instead of settingsHandler blocks
2018-10-19T15:09:39 <stegru> yes
2018-10-19T15:10:22 <cindyli> jhernandez: do you get an error with your pull request 693? or doesn\'t work without an error?
2018-10-19T15:11:20 <jhernandez> no error, it just enables highContrast with whatever the last high contrast them was used
2018-10-19T15:11:46 <jhernandez> well, no error, but didn\'t check the logs, looking now
2018-10-19T15:12:03 * dandimitrov joined the channel
2018-10-19T15:12:32 <jhernandez> stegru: oh, and locally, I\'m setting the highContrastOn to true
2018-10-19T15:12:38 <jhernandez> ;)
2018-10-19T15:16:41 * dandimitrov has quit

2018-10-19T15:20:17 <stegru> feel free to paste the log, so i can inspect it with a nit comb
2018-10-19T15:24:07 <jhernandez> no errors
2018-10-19T15:24:37 <jhernandez> let me put it into pastebin
2018-10-19T15:28:43 <jhernandez> stegru: https://pastebin.com/ygWBbjS1
2018-10-19T15:29:58 <stegru> ok nothing obvious
2018-10-19T15:30:48 <stegru> 08:27:22.769:  Resetting on system startup completes successfully.
2018-10-19T15:30:52 <stegru> see? it worked! ;)
