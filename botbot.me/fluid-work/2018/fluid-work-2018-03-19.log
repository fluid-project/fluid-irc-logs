2018-03-19T18:28:37 <kvuser> cindyli: The PR(#79) i\'ve sent before is working fine. I\'ve tested it. But, there\'s warning coming on the top "Deprecated: mysql_real_escape_string(): The mysql extension is deprecated and will be removed in the future: use mysqli or PDO instead ....." because i\'ve updated all the mysql_* functions except mysqli_escape_string(). the-t-in-rtf
2018-03-19T18:30:02 <kvuser> As i need to pass the db link in mysqli_escape_string() as first parameter. And there are some files which have used this function but do not require db link otherwise.  But since this function escapes the URI input, we can\'t ignore it.

2018-03-19T18:31:00 <cindyli> kvuser: which pull request are you referring to?
2018-03-19T18:31:19 <cindyli> i see, https://github.com/inclusive-design/AChecker/pull/79
2018-03-19T18:31:23 <kvuser> cindyli: We can now create a custom escape function which will return a safe URI or we can pass the db connection in the parameter.The latter is more safe i guess. But I do not know how do i pass the db link in some files. For example, in /checker/index.php file, how do i access the link
2018-03-19T18:31:38 <kvuser> Yes. PR #79
2018-03-19T18:33:02 <kvuser> cindyli: Including the class. and then making an object and then accessing it via some function can be a way.  But, I believe there must be some other way as well.

2018-03-19T18:37:50 <kvuser> cindyli: Check this Line https://github.com/inclusive-design/AChecker/blob/master/checker/index.php#L131
2018-03-19T18:39:53 <kvuser> Here.. $addslashes() is mysql_escape_string(). If i change the defintion of addslashes to mysqli_escape_string. It gives an error.
2018-03-19T18:41:11 <kvuser> cindyli: So, we can either hide the warning for now. Because other mysql_* functions have been updated to mysqli_*. Else, we need to pass db link in each file using these functions.
2018-03-19T18:41:25 * gtirloni joined the channel
2018-03-19T18:42:29 <cindyli> kvuser: i see. I think the example you gave is a misuse of $addslashes(). according to php doc - http://php.net/manual/en/mysqli.real-escape-string.php
2018-03-19T18:42:35 <cindyli> Escapes special characters in a string for use in an SQL statement, taking into account the current charset of the connection

2018-03-19T18:43:11 <cindyli> escaping url should use a different escape function
2018-03-19T18:43:18 <cindyli> thanks for catching this bug, kvuser
2018-03-19T18:44:15 <cindyli> of course, when the url is saved into the database, it still needs to be escaped as a string in a SQL, which is via addslashes
2018-03-19T18:45:16 <cindyli> since all AChecker db manipulations are thru DAO classes. At then, DAO will provide a class variable $db
2018-03-19T18:45:19 <kvuser> cindyli: So, we can create a custom function and pass it in that function to get escaped string?
2018-03-19T18:45:41 <cindyli> well, it depends on the situation

2018-03-19T18:47:13 * Vinay_ joined the channel
2018-03-19T18:47:23 <cindyli> as said, if the escape is for saving into database, addslashes should be performed in a DAO class instead of checker/index.php
2018-03-19T18:47:24 * Siddhant_k has quit
2018-03-19T18:48:04 <cindyli> if what\'s done in checker/index.php is to escape an url, the line here should use urlencode() instead of $addslashes
2018-03-19T18:50:08 <kvuser> cindyli: I think I\'ve seen this use in few other files as well. So, the code needs some refactoring. For this PR, should i hide the warning. And start working on this another issue>
2018-03-19T18:51:08 <cindyli> kvuser: no, never hide warnings

2018-03-19T18:51:59 <cindyli> i think this issue could be addressed in the same pull request due to its nature of mysql upgrade
2018-03-19T18:52:20 <kvuser> cindyli: Okay! Cool. Thanks.
2018-03-19T18:52:41 <cindyli> thanks very much for your contribution, kvuser
2018-03-19T18:52:47 <kvuser> I\'ll fix it asap and update the PR.
2018-03-19T18:52:54 <cindyli> thanks
2018-03-19T18:55:51 <gtirloni> cindyli kvuser: which php and mysql versions are we targeting? just curious
2018-03-19T18:56:08 <kvuser> cindyli: It\'s my pleasure to contribute in such an awesome project. It\'s rare to find quality php projects with clean and well organized code.
2018-03-19T18:57:28 <cindyli> gtirloni: PHP 7+ and mysql 5.6 i believe

2018-03-19T19:07:21 <Vinay_> jhung : Sir, as I can clearly see one of the main objective of project is to synchronize the print copy and source content. My question is do we need to build the entire workflow from scratch or is there any starting part available?
2018-03-19T19:08:22 <Vinay_> And sir also, in the project description three example workflow\'s are provided, does all three are in project\'s scope ?
2018-03-19T19:10:23 <jhung> Vinay_: the work flow we have been using is a manual process. Whenever someone updates the web version, the PDF is manually updated using Adobe InDesign or Adobe Illustrator. This manual update can take a long time and we would like that to be easier (i.e. some automation could help).
2018-03-19T19:12:11 <Vinay_> Sir, is there any documentation where I can learn more about Inclusive Design Guide which would help me to understand the project in a greater depth and hence would help me building a better proposal?
2018-03-19T19:12:16 <jhung> Vinay_: the 3 examples are just examples to help illustrate a possible solution - there may be better solutions out there. This project is to research possible solutions, document them, and create a proof-of-concept / prototype of some of them.
2018-03-19T19:13:50 <jhung> Vinay_: a good place to start is to look at the Github repository which the web version is created from. You will see there that there is all the content, but the PDFs I linked in the project description are already out of sync. The project will help us with solving this problem of keeping the two updated.

2018-03-19T13:00:37 <dandimitrov__> Hey Bosmon! We\'ve been trying the approach with distributing translations from a component higher in the hierarchy. We have a single component that "knows" about the i18n and it updates the dependent components\' messages for grades it finds from the message keys. Ref: https://github.com/danailbd/gpii-app/commit/c49061c44f8d5faf2d013cac7072501d1d81e68b#diff-bc685c59057ecd52516b874e2d4f418fR76
2018-03-19T13:00:42 <dandimitrov__> In simple cases it works properly but as it distributes messages relatively early (on creation of the distributor itself) if there are subcomponents (somewhere in the hierarchy) with createOnEvent, they won\'t receive the initial distribution of messages. Is there some mechanism for generating `distributeOptions` dynamically? We could use such to add direct model links (bi-directional) or at least some event firing that would trigger the
2018-03-19T13:00:42 <dandimitrov__> distribution for that component.

2018-03-19T14:38:06 <Justin_o> colinclark, bosmon, the-t-in-rtf: I\'m reviewing https://github.com/fluid-project/fluid-publish/pull/10
2018-03-19T14:38:30 <Justin_o> so one thing I\'m noticing is that in the change we checkout package-lock.json to revert it. This is to address the issue specified in https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6250
2018-03-19T14:38:46 <Justin_o> however, if there is no package-lock.json file it will through an error
2018-03-19T14:38:58 <colinclark> yes
2018-03-19T14:39:08 <Justin_o> i guess this is the case for both older versions of NPM and also if your project decided not to version it
2018-03-19T14:39:14 <colinclark> right
2018-03-19T14:39:25 <colinclark> doesn\'t seem a terribly robust solution
2018-03-19T14:42:35 <Justin_o> colinclark: looks like you can check if a file is tracked by git https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2405305/how-to-tell-if-a-file-is-git-tracked-by-shell-exit-code
2018-03-19T14:43:20 <Justin_o> So i guess we could iterate over a set of files to revert and only run the command if they are actually being tracked.

2018-03-19T14:53:46 <colinclark> seems reasonable
2018-03-19T14:55:53 <Justin_o> i left a comment on the PR about the above
