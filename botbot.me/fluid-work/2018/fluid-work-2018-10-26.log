b'2018-10-26T19:56:45 <mrtyler> and then #7 and #8
2018-10-26T19:57:00 <mrtyler> and then, if that all goes well, \'rake\'
2018-10-26T19:57:27 <clown> no dev-clown roles in AWS console...
2018-10-26T20:01:36 <clown> I\'ve got as far as #7 (rake _destroy), and got an error message, mrtyler:
2018-10-26T20:01:38 <clown> Error copying source module: error downloading \'file:///var/folders/0h/_ftz_ssn5d770s7btbpkngs40000gn/T/rake-tmp/dev-clown-modules\': source path error: stat /var/folders/0h/_ftz_ssn5d770s7btbpkngs40000gn/T/rake-tmp/dev-clown-modules: no such file or directory
2018-10-26T20:01:54 <clown> is that a problem?
2018-10-26T20:03:50 <mrtyler> hmm
2018-10-26T20:04:14 <mrtyler> nah, please ignore it and move on
2018-10-26T20:04:40 <mrtyler> i took a pass over aws and didn\'t see any leftover resources. i think you cleaned everything well
2018-10-26T20:04:58 <clown> okay, finished #8.  Here goes\xe2\x80\xa6

2018-10-26T20:07:51 <mrtyler> great
2018-10-26T20:08:57 <clown> rats, an error:  "Error: Error applying plan:"  Something to do with keys.  I\'ll copy the relevant stuff without the sensitive information.

2018-10-26T20:10:56 * clown is guessing as to what is sensitive
2018-10-26T20:11:13 <mrtyler> the good news is i don\'t think anything in that output is sensitive :)
2018-10-26T20:11:22 * cindyli joined the channel
2018-10-26T20:11:24 <clown> cool
2018-10-26T20:13:32 <mrtyler> sorry that\'s not where it is
2018-10-26T20:13:34 <mrtyler> it\'s here: https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-east-2#KeyPairs:sort=keyName
2018-10-26T20:13:57 <clown> oh, I thought I had just found it under "users/Joseph\xe2\x80\xa6"
2018-10-26T20:14:05 <clown> okay, trying that url.
2018-10-26T20:14:55 <clown> deleted
2018-10-26T20:15:17 <clown> "rake" the sand again?
2018-10-26T20:15:56 <clown> or should I clean up a bit first, e.g., rake destroy; rake clobber ?
2018-10-26T20:16:04 <mrtyler> i added a new bullet under #6 https://github.com/gpii-ops/gpii-infra/tree/master/aws#my-cluster-is-messed-up-and-i-just-want-to-get-rid-of-it-so-i-can-start-over
2018-10-26T20:16:23 <mrtyler> no need to destroy or clobber, just rake again
2018-10-26T20:16:32 <clown> rake\'ing
2018-10-26T20:19:12 <clown> chugging along\xe2\x80\xa6 no errors yet.

2018-10-26T20:23:33 <clown> perhaps an error:  it\'s picking up an old host key from my \'know_hosts\' for api.dev-clown.gpii.net and warning me about a possible DNS snoop.
2018-10-26T20:24:10 <clown> nonetheless, it is still creating stuff and continuing on.
2018-10-26T20:24:58 <clown> a familiar message:  GPII key carla does not exist
2018-10-26T20:25:09 <clown> oddly a good sign, that.
2018-10-26T20:25:29 <clown> it means the cluster is coming together.

2018-10-26T20:27:44 <clown> whoa.  it looks like the dataloader did its thing, even.  Looking more closely.
2018-10-26T20:28:20 <mrtyler> congrats :)
2018-10-26T20:32:55 * cindyli has quit
2018-10-26T20:33:47 <clown> aha.  the database ran and loaded the views and snapsets, but did not exit.   It\'s still in a run state.  Hmmm\xe2\x80\xa6.
2018-10-26T20:34:15 <clown> nope, I\'m wrong.  It terminated.  I was looking in the wrong place.

2018-10-26T18:58:44 <mrtyler> clown: cindyli summoned me :)
2018-10-26T18:59:02 <mrtyler> i hear you are having trouble with dataloader
2018-10-26T18:59:03 <clown> mrtyler:  I was about to summon you myself.
2018-10-26T18:59:11 <clown> although "summon" may be too strong.
2018-10-26T18:59:30 <mrtyler> yes i was being facetious :)
2018-10-26T18:59:31 <clown> I\'m having trouble starting my aws dev environment
2018-10-26T18:59:43 <clown> never mind the dataloader.
2018-10-26T19:00:26 <clown> I\'ve gone through the whole sequence here:  https://github.com/gpii-ops/gpii-infra/blob/master/aws/README.md#my-cluster-is-messed-up-and-i-just-want-to-get-rid-of-it-so-i-can-start-over
2018-10-26T19:00:45 <clown> including the AWS console and deleting various "dev-clown" resources.
2018-10-26T19:01:03 <clown> But now "rake" does virtually nothing.
2018-10-26T19:01:36 <clown> the laste time I invoked it was as:  "rake \xe2\x80\x94trace"
2018-10-26T19:01:59 <clown> I got:
2018-10-26T19:01:59 <clown> rake aborted!
2018-10-26T19:01:59 <clown> No Rakefile found (looking for: rakefile, Rakefile, rakefile.rb, Rakefile.rb)
2018-10-26T19:02:08 <clown> whence the rake file?
2018-10-26T19:02:55 <clown> anyhow, I\'ve since gone to the top of that readme and verified that I have all the tools with the correct versions.
2018-10-26T19:03:26 <mrtyler> no Rakefile found sounds like you\'re in the wrong directory? what is your working directory?
2018-10-26T19:03:27 <clown> and have worked my way down to: https://github.com/gpii-ops/gpii-infra/blob/master/aws/README.md#provision-an-environment
2018-10-26T19:03:40 <clown> *smacks head really hard*
2018-10-26T19:05:35 <clown> yeah, I was in another "dev" environment \xe2\x80\xa6
2018-10-26T19:05:49 <clown> now that I\'m in the correct one, the first error is "Error: Error loading state: state data in S3 does not have the expected content"
2018-10-26T19:06:26 <clown> and, it repeats for three time, then exits
2018-10-26T19:06:34 <clown> "it" being that error
2018-10-26T19:06:46 <mrtyler> i would start with \'rake clobber\'
2018-10-26T19:07:46 <clown> rake clobber did its thing with no errors.
2018-10-26T19:07:51 <clown> now rake?
2018-10-26T19:07:57 <mrtyler> yes
2018-10-26T19:08:48 <clown> Same three errors.
2018-10-26T19:09:12 <mrtyler> next i would look at #4 at https://github.com/gpii-ops/gpii-infra/blob/master/aws/README.md#my-cluster-is-messed-up-and-i-just-want-to-get-rid-of-it-so-i-can-start-over
2018-10-26T19:09:13 <clown> I love this one: "\xe2\x80\xa6  you may need to manually verify the remote state and update the Digest value stored in the DynamoDB table to the following value: "  No value is provided.
2018-10-26T19:09:48 <mrtyler> clearing out dynamodb is one of the bullets under #4, so maybe this is the right track
2018-10-26T19:10:16 <clown> okay, but I\'ll check S3 first, just to be sure.  Hang on.
2018-10-26T19:10:33 <mrtyler> yeah i would clean them both out
2018-10-26T19:11:58 <clown> S3 shows no "dev-clown" stuff in gpii-terraform-state, gpii-terraform-state/prereqs, nor gpii-kubernetes-state
2018-10-26T19:12:19 <clown> I cleaned them out earlier today.  They appear to still be clean.
2018-10-26T19:13:36 <clown> I\'m a little brain dead \xe2\x80\x94 remind me what to do re dynamodb
2018-10-26T19:13:57 <clown> how do I find out the ID and Path?
2018-10-26T19:15:39 <mrtyler> #6 under https://github.com/gpii-ops/gpii-infra/blob/master/aws/README.md#error-acquiring-the-state-lock
2018-10-26T19:16:11 <simonjb> hi Justin_o, are you working at the moment?
2018-10-26T19:16:57 <simonjb> I had a question about the FLUID-6298 PR
2018-10-26T19:17:14 <clown> yes I\'m at step 2. in that section that says, "Find the ID and Path from the error message (see above)".
2018-10-26T19:17:21 <clown> But I don\'t have such an error message.
2018-10-26T19:17:48 <clown> so, where else do I look?
2018-10-26T19:21:00 <clown> or, how do I generate the error message?
2018-10-26T19:22:02 <mrtyler> you can jump directly to #6
2018-10-26T19:22:57 <clown> okay, trying that
2018-10-26T19:27:00 <clown> mrtyler:  DynamoDB does not show any tables.  I get a splash page "Amazon DynamoDB"  inviting me to create a table, or go to "Getting started guide", etc.  There is one link "Monitoring tables"  \xe2\x80\x94 I\'ll see where that one goes.
2018-10-26T19:29:29 * stepan[rtf] joined the channel
2018-10-26T19:30:04 <stepan[rtf]> hi @clown Cindy mentioned some issue with dataloader?
2018-10-26T19:30:32 <clown> hi stepan.  I\'m having troubles with just staring my AWS dev environment.
2018-10-26T19:30:44 <clown> I\'m enjoying some hand holding from mrtyler
2018-10-26T19:31:09 <clown> *\xe2\x80\xa6 just starting
2018-10-26T19:31:15 <stepan[rtf]> yeah, just catching up :)..
2018-10-26T19:31:25 <clown> although I have been staring a lot too...
2018-10-26T19:31:31 <stepan[rtf]> the new dataloader didn\'t make it in the infra code yet, just fyi guys
2018-10-26T19:32:44 <clown> mytyler:  clicking the links on that page just leads me to various documentation pages.  Looking closely at the url, it ends with "#gettingStarted".  Even if I delete that anchor, it just puts me back there.
2018-10-26T19:32:51 <clown> https://console.aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/home?region=us-east-1#gettingStarted:
2018-10-26T19:33:55 <clown> stepan[rtf]:  do you mean make it into master?  I\'m running things off of your pull requests.
2018-10-26T19:34:13 <clown> well, I would run things from there, if I could start the environment...
2018-10-26T19:34:26 <stepan[rtf]> ok, I\'ll leave you to it guys, as my dinner just arrived and my dear gf demans some attention :), but if there\'s anything with DL just ping me and I\'ll catch up on that later
2018-10-26T19:34:34 <stepan[rtf]> yes mean master
2018-10-26T19:34:55 <clown> have a nice dinnner and weekend.  Your dear bg as well, stepan[rtf]
2018-10-26T19:35:01 <clown> *gf
2018-10-26T19:35:47 <stepan[rtf]> my branch - stepanstipl/gpii-infra/GPII-3391-parametrise-force-update *should* work
2018-10-26T19:35:58 <stepan[rtf]> I have tested on GCP so I can say it works there just fine
2018-10-26T19:35:59 * clown who did \'gf\' become \'bg\'???
2018-10-26T19:36:28 * clown and how did "how" become "who"/
2018-10-26T19:36:44 <clown> yes, stepan[rtf] that\'s the pull I\'m taking about.
2018-10-26T19:37:05 * clown maybe I should switch to GCP.
2018-10-26T19:37:12 <stepan[rtf]> :D  on AWS the behaviour is slightly different - it should work when you create a new cluster, but if you\'re just upgrading existing one, the new dataloader won\'t get applied there
2018-10-26T19:37:42 <stepan[rtf]> (that\'s consistent with how it behaves now, as the dataloader batch job is never recreated)
2018-10-26T19:38:02 <clown> stepan[rtf]: At this point I\'ve oblitereated all my dev resources on AWS, and am starting from scratch.  Although it appears something is wrong with my dynamodb.
2018-10-26T19:38:36 <mrtyler> clown: sounds like you\'re not starting from the aws dashboard and ended up at some other dynamodb page. https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/home?region=us-east-2
2018-10-26T19:39:02 <stepan[rtf]> I would recommend switch to GCP :), I think the experience is better...
2018-10-26T19:39:28 <clown> right, mrtyler.  From AWS dashboard, I clicked the DynamoDB service link (or I thought that\'s what I was doing).
2018-10-26T19:39:58 <mrtyler> when i do that, i am taken to the link i pasted. do you end up somewhere else?
2018-10-26T19:40:41 <mrtyler> anyway, the instructions look like they should work if you start from that link
2018-10-26T19:40:51 <mrtyler> but i am hanging around to see if that is the case :)
2018-10-26T19:41:39 <clown> aha.  pasting your link got me somewhere else that looks like it might be where I want to be.  Checking...
2018-10-26T19:43:11 <clown> some success \xe2\x80\x94 I found the "Items".  There are a lot.  Looking for "dev-clown" ones.
2018-10-26T19:45:01 <clown> I found and deleted three.  Double checking that there are no more.
2018-10-26T19:46:00 <clown> found two more.  any way to filter on "dev-clown"?
2018-10-26T19:49:41 <mrtyler> looks like there is a filter mechanism at the top of the page
2018-10-26T19:49:49 <mrtyler> the Items page
2018-10-26T19:50:59 <mrtyler> although i can\'t make it work so far
2018-10-26T19:51:49 <mrtyler> wait, it works. doesn\'t look like there are any remaining dev-clown locks
2018-10-26T19:52:36 <clown> I gave up on filters, and went for the simpler find-on-page (cmd-f).  I can\'t find any more dev-clown locks.
2018-10-26T19:53:08 <clown> so, time for another "rake"?
2018-10-26T19:53:41 <mrtyler> yes
2018-10-26T19:53:50 * clown crosses fingers
