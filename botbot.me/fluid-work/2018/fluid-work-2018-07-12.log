2018-07-12T08:45:41 <javjarfer[m]> Good morning Bosmon !
2018-07-12T08:46:06 <Bosmon> Hi there javjarfer[m]
2018-07-12T08:46:36 <javjarfer[m]> I have recently pushed a branch to a fork of infusion, with the test that you requested, which is currently failing https://github.com/JavierJF/infusion/tree/GPII-3201
2018-07-12T08:47:04 <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - that\'s excellent
2018-07-12T08:47:07 <Bosmon> Can raise a PR from it too?
2018-07-12T08:47:25 <javjarfer[m]> of course
2018-07-12T09:59:49 <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - that\'s awesome, thanks!
2018-07-12T09:59:58 <Bosmon> If you happen to have a moment, you could try to look into a fix
2018-07-12T10:00:04 <Bosmon> Otherwise I will take a look later on ....
2018-07-12T10:07:24 <javjarfer[m]> Oh, I would like, but I\'m afraid that I have received even more settings for the first wave, and that I also need to prepare several snapsets for Kavya
2018-07-12T10:07:51 <javjarfer[m]> If the issue still continues after I have attended this priorities I will take a look to it of course! Thanks Bosmon
2018-07-12T10:08:06 <Bosmon> Sure, no worries
2018-07-12T10:45:27 * kasparnet has quit
2018-07-12T10:51:39 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: Hey, Antranig! I managed to fix the broken PSP tests. However, I ran into another issue that we\'ve had before and I am not sure what is causing it this time
2018-07-12T10:51:48 * dandimitrov has quit
2018-07-12T10:52:25 <georgitodorov> We have 9 sets of integration tests and every set completes successfully when run on its own. If we run two or more sets of integration tests together, they fail
2018-07-12T10:53:21 <georgitodorov> Do we need to do something special at the end of each integration tests set so that we close any open connections or clear up resources or something else?
2018-07-12T11:02:03 * dandimitrov joined the channel
2018-07-12T11:07:09 <Bosmon> georgitodorov - nothing that I can specially think of
2018-07-12T11:07:14 <Bosmon> What kind of failure do you get?
2018-07-12T11:07:25 <Bosmon> georgitodorov - ah actually I think I know what is happening
2018-07-12T11:07:38 <Bosmon> I had exactly the same issue when I upgraded to cindyli\'s new work
2018-07-12T11:08:02 <Bosmon> There are two flavours of the "configs" now, one which cleans up the pouchDB database after a test, and one which doesn\'t
2018-07-12T11:08:14 <Bosmon> And I suspect you have ended up with the wrong one
2018-07-12T11:10:44 <Bosmon> Well, at least this is a possibility
2018-07-12T11:10:50 <Bosmon> What does the failure look like?
2018-07-12T11:11:58 * dandimitrov has quit
2018-07-12T11:25:29 * dandimitrov joined the channel
2018-07-12T11:32:33 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: This is the weird part - the error occurs in the PSP code itself
2018-07-12T11:32:46 <georgitodorov> But it is not present when running a single set of tests
2018-07-12T11:33:07 <georgitodorov> Can you tell me the configuration I should be using so that the database is cleared?
2018-07-12T11:35:16 <Bosmon> Hi georgitodorov - yes, the difference should be explained in the README in this directory: https://github.com/GPII/universal/tree/master/gpii/configs
2018-07-12T11:35:45 <Bosmon> The grades which have simply "local" rather than "all.local" should be the ones which perform the cleanup
2018-07-12T11:35:52 <Bosmon> georgitodorov - but what error occurs in the PSP code?
2018-07-12T11:37:20 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: This is it: https://pastebin.com/icnRLPL1
2018-07-12T11:37:44 <Bosmon> Oh wow
2018-07-12T11:37:50 <Bosmon> No, this is certainly a different kind of problem
2018-07-12T11:38:38 <Bosmon> Is this from the code in your current pull #48?
2018-07-12T11:39:46 <Bosmon> https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/pull/48/files#diff-03e7589bd3d53554dc562cc2581c3597R97
2018-07-12T11:39:48 <Bosmon> THis line?
2018-07-12T11:41:58 <Bosmon> Well, that\'s pretty funky - I wonder what has ended up in "events" without a "fire" method
2018-07-12T11:42:56 <Bosmon> Next step is to check on line 73 what the eventName is and then what its value is
2018-07-12T11:43:23 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: It might be a different issue but isn\'t it strange that there is no error when running the tests one by one?
2018-07-12T11:43:45 <georgitodorov> I am trying to use the configuration that you suggested now to see what will happen
2018-07-12T11:43:47 <Bosmon> georgitodorov - it is certainly strange yes
2018-07-12T11:44:26 <Bosmon> It will most likely be some cleanup issue caused by some shared reference between the components which are being destroyed by the previous test and the ones created by the new test
2018-07-12T11:45:38 * dandimitrov has quit
2018-07-12T11:48:21 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: Maybe, I need to investigate further...
2018-07-12T11:48:50 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: https://github.com/danailbd/gpii-app/blob/master/tests/IntegrationTests.js#L93 should be substituted with this: gpii.test.bootstrapServer
2018-07-12T11:49:02 <Bosmon> georgitodorov - your "propertyHistoryManager" is nice
2018-07-12T11:49:05 <Bosmon> georgitodorov - I think so, yes
2018-07-12T11:50:02 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: And I changed this https://github.com/danailbd/gpii-app/blob/master/tests/SettingsBrokerTestDefs.js#L142 gradeName with "gpii.test.pouch.pouchTestCaseHolder"
2018-07-12T11:50:12 <georgitodorov> And the configuration also...but still errors
2018-07-12T11:50:27 <Bosmon> georgitodorov - yes, I wouldn\'t expect those changes to make any difference to a problem of the kind you\'re facing
2018-07-12T11:50:45 <Bosmon> Best to investigate what the event is, which should give a clue about the situation
2018-07-12T11:51:38 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: Will do, thanks

2018-07-12T12:32:53 <javjarfer[m]> I\'m still with user testing work xD

2018-07-12T15:54:42 <Bosmon> No, I am really only asking the former question :)

2018-07-12T15:54:59 <Bosmon> ok

2018-07-12T16:06:24 <stegru> amatas[m]: the installer download is amazing! is it possible to include more info in the filename, such as the PR or build number?
2018-07-12T16:10:03 * colinclark has quit
2018-07-12T16:10:44 <amatas[m]> stegru: I think it\'s possible, but we have to figure out how to pass that info from the host to the VM. And then take that info into account when the installer is built.
2018-07-12T16:11:24 <stegru> oh no it\'s ok then, I thought it might have been easier
2018-07-12T16:11:43 <stegru> of course, the filename is from the build script
2018-07-12T16:12:09 <stegru> at least it\'s not "latest-build.zip", like I\'ve had in the past.
2018-07-12T16:35:04 <Bosmon> Hey jhernandez - could you give https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/166 a dusting off?
2018-07-12T16:36:24 <Bosmon> stegru - the Wix installer compiler was the thing that changed the CompletionChar?
2018-07-12T16:52:28 <jhernandez> Bosmon: sure, will do ASAP and let you know when it is ready again
