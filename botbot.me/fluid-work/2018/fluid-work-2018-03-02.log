2018-03-02T22:38:12 <nilay_arora> Hi, I am Nilay Arora, a sophomore currently studying Computer Science Engineering at BITS Pilani, Pilani Campus, India. I wish to apply for GSoC with your organization. I have a programming experience of over five years in Javascript and Front-End Web Development and have gained substantial command over many web technologies such as AngularJS, NodeJS, WebAPIs, jQuery, AJAX, CSS, and HTML.
2018-03-02T22:39:04 <nilay_arora> While going through your project ideas I was fascinated by the idea, "Implement dynamic descriptions for an interactive PhET simulation" and "Accessible Music User Interface Toolkit with Nexus.js" . Can someone help me get started ?

2018-03-02T23:46:30 <VictorNG_> @cindly, I notice one thing when working on achecker, the accessibility check on the website are functional, but are not
2018-03-02T23:47:02 <VictorNG_> (functional on online platform, send out known problems etc)
2018-03-02T23:48:26 <VictorNG_> but on localhost both on the PHP 5.6 and PHP 7.0, the same check will give no known problems answer, whereas in the online platform, it will show a couple of errors

2018-03-02T14:02:07 <the-t-in-rtf> Where are we meeting?  @Bosmon?  Anyone?
2018-03-02T14:02:24 <Bosmon> Skype I think
2018-03-02T14:02:26 <Bosmon> It has worked in the past ...
2018-03-02T14:03:09 <gmoss> I haven't used Skype in ages, just setting it up at the moment, I'll be a minute or two
2018-03-02T14:03:28 <the-t-in-rtf> OK, I'm there whenever there's a call set up.
2018-03-02T14:03:47 <the-t-in-rtf> I guess we could reuse the group from last time.
2018-03-02T14:03:57 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I guess Alan isn't around?

2018-03-02T14:05:31 <Bosmon> Perhaps you have a POLAR VORTEX like us : P

2018-03-02T14:07:38 <Justin_o> true, not like the weather we had a few years ago at this time
2018-03-02T14:07:45 <Justin_o> alanharnum: we'll probably be meeting on skype

2018-03-02T16:19:44 * the-t-in-rtf joined the channel
2018-03-02T16:19:47 <gtirloni> Justin_o: our webrtc server can't hold a lot of people (i'd say, 5-10 at most). so it's usually better if people can install the desktop client, as that will redirect them to the physical vidyo appliance, which can accept more clients... we've had up to 20-25 with no problems I think
2018-03-02T16:20:33 <Justin_o> gtirloni: thanks, at a potential community meeting.. the presenter will be advertising to others to join
2018-03-02T16:21:58 <gtirloni> network-wise, we could handle up to 100 clients.. but i'm not sure about the cpu/memory of the appliances. i'd say after 30-40, it might start to get interesting
2018-03-02T16:23:28 <gtirloni> there's a webcast option (for listen only access), i think jess might have some experience with that.
