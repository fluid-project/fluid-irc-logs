2018-02-08T16:58:29 <cindyli> gtirloni: i don\'t find the "comment" button to comment on https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/INFRA-113 after login. but the "create" button is there. how weird
2018-02-08T16:58:42 <cindyli> not letting ppl to comment but allow the creation
2018-02-08T16:59:04 <gtirloni> weird, maybe the permissions are messed up
2018-02-08T16:59:29 <cindyli> the site is very slow
2018-02-08T16:59:59 <cindyli> the "comment" button appears for infusion JIRAs such as https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6192
2018-02-08T17:00:36 <gtirloni> ok, please try to reload it and see
2018-02-08T17:00:49 <gtirloni> it feels fast here
2018-02-08T17:00:50 * kasparnet has quit
2018-02-08T17:00:57 <gtirloni> i added an additional permissions for comments
2018-02-08T17:01:03 <cindyli> yes, "comment" appears now
2018-02-08T17:01:08 <gtirloni> cool
2018-02-08T17:01:23 <gtirloni> that project was private at some point, we opened it up recently

2018-02-08T17:38:29 <grrrero> Hi cindyli! (cc: michelled) I have this JIRA: https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/SNOW-15
2018-02-08T17:38:59 <grrrero> I found that some of the refactoring I did caused WP to spit out an error
2018-02-08T17:39:34 <grrrero> More info at the JIRA but I\'d love to hear your opinion on whether there\'s another way around it or if rolling back is better
2018-02-08T17:41:46 <grrrero> fluid-everyone: Also I forgot to send the above ^ for my update at standup
2018-02-08T17:49:01 <grrrero> Also working on SNOW-4 as per jhung\'s PR comments
2018-02-08T17:49:03 <cindyli> grrrero: if add_action() is expecting a function name as the 2nd parameter, yes, we need to satisfy. but not a complete rolling back. the parameters passed into snow_panel_widget() should continue to be from a centralized array.
2018-02-08T17:50:48 <cindyli> even better, it seems php allows the use of variables as function names. if so, the index of the array can be the function name, so one loop would handle the definition of functions and add_action() calls
2018-02-08T17:50:57 <cindyli> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8466473/use-variable-as-function-name-in-php
2018-02-08T17:51:27 <cindyli> instead of define static functions repeatedly
2018-02-08T17:52:59 <grrrero> I see cindyli that\'s interesting!!
2018-02-08T17:54:04 <grrrero> Will give it a try, thank you cindyli

2018-02-08T19:45:51 <cindyli> mrtyler: do you know when I ran this script in the universal to build docker images - https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/scripts/vagrantCloudBasedContainers.sh#L48, where does the dataloader repo/branch gets defined so the code base can be fetched and the data loader container is built upon? I\'d like to change it to point to my branch at https://github.com/cindyli/docker-preferences-dataloader/tree/GPII-2630
2018-02-08T19:55:14 <mrtyler> hi cindyli. looking

2018-02-08T20:03:40 <mrtyler> cindyli: the linked script is only used to build the docker image for universal
2018-02-08T20:03:49 <mrtyler> it has nothing to do with building the docker image for preferences-dataloader
2018-02-08T20:05:06 <mrtyler> here is where the image for the dataloader gets built by jenkins: https://github.com/GPII/ci-service/blob/master/jenkins_jobs/docker-gpii-preferences-dataloader.yml#L142
2018-02-08T20:05:11 <cindyli> mrtyler: ok. but it does load data into the couchdb. i wonder how it does that without the dataloader
2018-02-08T20:05:41 <mrtyler> ok i think i see what you\'re after
2018-02-08T20:06:18 <mrtyler> that script runs the dataloader here: https://github.com/GPII/ci-service/blob/master/jenkins_jobs/docker-gpii-preferences-dataloader.yml#L142
2018-02-08T20:06:31 <mrtyler> so you would change $DATALOADER_IMAGE
2018-02-08T20:06:51 <mrtyler> does that help?
2018-02-08T20:07:24 <mrtyler> er wait
2018-02-08T20:07:27 <mrtyler> that was the wrong link, sorry
2018-02-08T20:07:27 <mrtyler> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/scripts/vagrantCloudBasedContainers.sh#L59
2018-02-08T20:08:17 <cindyli> yes, where does DATALOADER_IMAGE come from
2018-02-08T20:08:28 <mrtyler> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/scripts/vagrantCloudBasedContainers.sh#L25 ?
2018-02-08T20:09:05 <cindyli> i know, but is it an existing one somewhere, or that image gets built everytime as part of this script?
2018-02-08T20:09:25 <mrtyler> it is built by jenkins in that other place i linked you
2018-02-08T20:09:29 <cindyli> ok
2018-02-08T20:09:30 <cindyli> got you
2018-02-08T20:09:47 <mrtyler> vagrantCloudBasedContainers.sh does not build preferences-dataloader; it only runs an existing one that has been uploaded (docker push\'d) to docker hub
2018-02-08T20:11:00 <cindyli> understand now. i think here\'s where needs to be changed to point to my own branch - https://github.com/GPII/ci-service/blob/master/jenkins_jobs/docker-gpii-preferences-dataloader.yml#L35-L36
2018-02-08T20:11:18 <cindyli> how does jenkins jobs get run?
2018-02-08T20:11:46 <mrtyler> that is correct
2018-02-08T20:11:50 <mrtyler> it is run by jenkins! :)
2018-02-08T20:12:17 <cindyli> i mean if i changed these 2 lines to point to my repo, how can i get it run so that https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/scripts/vagrantCloudBasedContainers.sh#L25 can fetch the new data loader image
2018-02-08T20:12:21 <mrtyler> i\'m not aware of any way to run that jenkins yaml by hand
2018-02-08T20:12:26 <cindyli> ok
2018-02-08T20:12:29 <mrtyler> so i would not do that
2018-02-08T20:12:51 <cindyli> cool, will build the data loader image by hand, separately from using https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/scripts/vagrantCloudBasedContainers.sh#L25h
2018-02-08T20:12:55 <mrtyler> you\'ll have to run the shell commands from that file by hand
2018-02-08T20:13:03 <mrtyler> docker rmi, docker build, docker push
2018-02-08T20:14:24 <cindyli> seems AWS is the only place i can test my cloud change, was planning to test in VM with new images
2018-02-08T20:14:33 <cindyli> thanks
2018-02-08T20:14:57 <mrtyler> what do you mean by "cloud change"?
2018-02-08T20:15:06 <mrtyler> i think the rest of your plan is sound
2018-02-08T20:17:29 <cindyli> vagrantCloudBasedContainers.sh will use the old data loader that was built by jenkins based on universal master code to load data. this means, with my change, the new data structure will be failed to load into couchdb
2018-02-08T20:18:09 <cindyli> but i guess i can try to manually load the data into the couchdb in the vm
2018-02-08T20:18:18 <cindyli> i will see how that goes
2018-02-08T20:19:08 <mrtyler> how are you running vagrantCloudBasedContainers.sh?
2018-02-08T20:19:11 <cindyli> sorry, the old data loader was based on docker-preferences-dataloader master
2018-02-08T20:19:33 <cindyli> mrtyler: inside the vm
2018-02-08T20:19:47 <mrtyler> when you\'re ready to test your dataloader in the cloud, you\'ll do that via version.yml like we discussed yesterday
2018-02-08T20:19:55 <cindyli> the vm is started using "vagrant up" from universal root dir
2018-02-08T20:20:19 <cindyli> yes, i know that, but that is with my personal cloud
2018-02-08T20:20:19 <mrtyler> right so you can edit vCBC.sh to point to your branch and run that inside the vm
2018-02-08T20:20:24 <mrtyler> it will drop the old data and replace with your new data

2018-02-08T20:23:15 <cindyli> mrtyler: we might be talking about different repos. the branch that i wanna change to to build the new dataloader image is GPII-2630 branch for cindyli/docker-preferences-dataloader
2018-02-08T20:23:21 <cindyli> i thought that\'s part of jenkins
2018-02-08T20:23:35 <cindyli> not modifiable
2018-02-08T20:24:13 <mrtyler> let me walk through what i think you need to do
2018-02-08T20:24:31 <mrtyler> 1. build a dataloader docker image locally using your branch
2018-02-08T20:24:36 <mrtyler> 2. push that image to docker hub
2018-02-08T20:24:50 <mrtyler> 3. modify vCBC.sh to point to the dataloader image you just uploaded
2018-02-08T20:25:11 <mrtyler> 4. run vCBC.sh inside your vagrant box, so that it drops the old data and loads the new data based on your dataloader image
2018-02-08T20:25:16 <cindyli> i see
2018-02-08T20:25:40 <cindyli> this line https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/scripts/vagrantCloudBasedContainers.sh#L25 will be cindyli/preferences-dataloader
2018-02-08T20:25:49 <mrtyler> yes
2018-02-08T20:26:05 <cindyli> cool. will try
2018-02-08T20:26:22 <mrtyler> gl :)
2018-02-08T20:26:26 <mrtyler> lmk if you run into trouble
2018-02-08T20:26:52 <cindyli> sure. thanks very much, mrtyler

2018-02-08T21:34:08 <gtirloni> if you\'re working on your branch of universal or you submit a PR for universal, that\'s where the data will come from
2018-02-08T21:35:43 <gtirloni> speaking strictly about vagrantCloudBasedContainers.sh running inside vagrant here. I\'m not familiar how gpii-infra will do it, sorry

2018-02-08T10:30:41 <the-t-in-rtf> Morning, @bosmon.
2018-02-08T10:30:57 <the-t-in-rtf> I need a dev release that includes the fluid.stringTemplate work before I can finish my i18n spike: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/871#issuecomment-364069535
2018-02-08T10:31:01 <the-t-in-rtf> (of Infusion)
2018-02-08T10:31:08 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - how did you detect my experrection?
2018-02-08T10:31:22 <the-t-in-rtf> little green bubble next to your name?
2018-02-08T10:31:37 <Bosmon> But on Gchat, right? : P
2018-02-08T10:31:40 <the-t-in-rtf> nope.

2018-02-08T10:31:44 <Bosmon> ?!
2018-02-08T10:31:49 <Bosmon> wth
2018-02-08T10:32:07 <the-t-in-rtf> For whatever reason I show up as read, NFI what mechanism it uses.
2018-02-08T10:32:13 <the-t-in-rtf> red
2018-02-08T10:33:00 <Bosmon> OK, it can probably be merged, let me peek again
2018-02-08T10:33:03 <the-t-in-rtf> Thanks.
2018-02-08T10:33:03 <Bosmon> Although I am slow yet
2018-02-08T10:33:10 <the-t-in-rtf> A dev release is enough.
2018-02-08T10:33:16 <Bosmon> He slept very well tonight
2018-02-08T10:33:22 <Bosmon> Rachael says she even got up before him
2018-02-08T10:33:26 <the-t-in-rtf> That\'s good.
2018-02-08T10:33:40 <the-t-in-rtf> I\'m at about 75% myself, had a wisdom tooth out yesterday and slept not all that well.
2018-02-08T10:33:45 <Bosmon> Thanks for the global fixes to the JSDocs
2018-02-08T10:33:48 <Bosmon> Wow!
2018-02-08T10:33:51 <Bosmon> Sorry to hear that
2018-02-08T10:33:55 <Bosmon> How many do you now have left?
2018-02-08T10:33:58 <the-t-in-rtf> Thankfully I got close enough pre-tooth to limp along today.
2018-02-08T10:33:59 <the-t-in-rtf> zero.
2018-02-08T10:34:02 <Bosmon> Excellent
2018-02-08T10:34:02 <the-t-in-rtf> I only had the one.
2018-02-08T10:35:04 <Bosmon> I did remarkably well after my final extraction in Boulder and was trying to eat cake the same day ...
2018-02-08T10:35:43 <the-t-in-rtf> Upper or lower?
2018-02-08T10:35:50 <the-t-in-rtf> Apparently upper are very survivable.
2018-02-08T10:36:00 <the-t-in-rtf> lower ones are the painful ones.
2018-02-08T10:36:01 <Bosmon> Oh yes, it was upper
2018-02-08T10:36:50 <Bosmon> I had my lowers out in 1995 ...
2018-02-08T10:36:52 <the-t-in-rtf> Elaine was astonished that I was at last night\'s meeting, she was remembering having all four including two lowers under general.
2018-02-08T10:36:58 <Bosmon> Probably about the same time as the PI competition : P
2018-02-08T10:37:06 <the-t-in-rtf> oh, that would have been funny to see.
2018-02-08T10:47:27 <the-t-in-rtf> Ah, thanks, will touch things up.

2018-02-08T11:25:06 <the-t-in-rtf> OK,  @Bosmon, the fix for flattening null values is in.
2018-02-08T11:25:14 <the-t-in-rtf> Thanks for the quick feedback!
2018-02-08T11:25:19 <Bosmon> Awesome
2018-02-08T11:25:23 <Bosmon> So there was a bug after all?
2018-02-08T11:27:09 <Bosmon> Ah, I guess it would convert the object to {}
2018-02-08T11:31:25 <Bosmon> Awesome, thanks for the fixes, the-t-in-rtf
2018-02-08T11:31:32 <Bosmon> pull is merged and release 3.0.0-dev.20180208T113048Z.062ccd8 is rolled
2018-02-08T11:32:15 <the-t-in-rtf> awesome!
2018-02-08T11:32:17 <the-t-in-rtf> thanks!
2018-02-08T11:36:45 <the-t-in-rtf> OOOPS.
2018-02-08T11:37:10 <the-t-in-rtf> So, I need to put in another small pull to add the new message resolver file to the node includes.
2018-02-08T11:37:24 <the-t-in-rtf> My code fell over immediately with the new release.  I\'ll put that together ASAP.
2018-02-08T11:37:39 <the-t-in-rtf> The tests in infusion are browser only, which is how that was missed out.
2018-02-08T11:38:04 <the-t-in-rtf> (I mean the tests for those particular functions)

2018-02-08T11:44:35 <the-t-in-rtf> Sorry for that, here\'s the small pull to fix that.  If you can cut a dev release, I can confirm it\'s working in gpii-handlebars, where the code is actually used from Node.js

2018-02-08T11:48:46 <the-t-in-rtf> thanks again.
2018-02-08T11:49:39 <the-t-in-rtf> hasn\'t shown up yet?
2018-02-08T11:49:45 <the-t-in-rtf> ah, there we go.
2018-02-08T11:50:09 <the-t-in-rtf> Fair enough, npm releases aren\'t a form of instant messaging.
2018-02-08T11:50:42 <the-t-in-rtf> Awesome, works just fine.
2018-02-08T11:59:28 <kasparnet> Hola Senor Bosmon
2018-02-08T12:00:29 <kasparnet> (and perhaps sgithens, the-t-in-rtf, colinclark)
2018-02-08T12:00:37 <kasparnet> working on the liveness stuff right now
2018-02-08T12:01:06 <kasparnet> and part of our decision in the last call was to allow the "update" block to be omitted from the solutions registry
2018-02-08T12:01:36 <kasparnet> which would mean that we would simply infer the update actions from the "liveness" directive
2018-02-08T12:02:12 <kasparnet> (i.e. "live" liveness => set settings only, "liveRestart"/"manualRestart" => stop, configure, start cycle
2018-02-08T12:02:17 <kasparnet> (i.e. "live" liveness => set settings only, "liveRestart"/"manualRestart" => stop, configure, start cycle)
2018-02-08T12:02:59 <kasparnet> but I was wondering, while we\'re at it, whether we should allow the stop, start, isRunning, configure and restore block to be omitted as well
2018-02-08T12:03:10 <the-t-in-rtf> Is there supposed to be a difference in those two examples?
2018-02-08T12:03:25 <kasparnet> nope... just forgot the last ")" on the first line
2018-02-08T12:03:25 <the-t-in-rtf> Oh, I see, trailing paren.
2018-02-08T12:03:47 <kasparnet> if these are omitted, we would infer those as well
2018-02-08T12:04:09 <kasparnet> so anything in start, stop and isRunning we would expect to reference all the launchHandlers
2018-02-08T12:04:39 <kasparnet> and anything in configure and restore we would expect to reference all the settingshandlers for the solution
2018-02-08T12:05:12 <kasparnet> I think this is the case in, if not 100% then 95% of our solutions
2018-02-08T12:05:30 <kasparnet> dont know if that makes sense or I should make an example in a pad or something
2018-02-08T12:06:13 <Bosmon> kasparnet - no, that sounds like an excellent idea
2018-02-08T12:06:37 <kasparnet> ok cool - I\'ll implement that as well and make sure to document it

2018-02-08T14:43:23 <simonjb> good morning Bosmon
2018-02-08T14:43:38 <Bosmon> Hey there simonjb!
2018-02-08T14:43:46 <Bosmon> I see you on the document
2018-02-08T14:43:54 <Bosmon> Oh wow I see Philip too
2018-02-08T14:46:28 <simonjb> Bosmon: I\'ve never used ShareLaTeX before, if I click "Recompile" does that affect everyone?
2018-02-08T14:46:43 <Bosmon> simonjb - I don\'t believe so no
2018-02-08T14:46:47 <Bosmon> The document currently doesn\'t compile
2018-02-08T14:46:50 <Bosmon> Should do in a few more seconds
2018-02-08T14:47:23 <simonjb> Ok, I tried to recompile but am seeing errors, hoping you weren\'t seeing them also
2018-02-08T14:47:59 <simonjb> unless you are also recompiling :)

2018-02-08T14:52:23 <Bosmon> simonjb - ok, got rid of the errors now
2018-02-08T14:55:29 <simonjb> Bosmon: compiling now for me, thanks

2018-02-08T15:20:46 <Bosmon> Sure
2018-02-08T15:20:52 <Bosmon> I think Philip might be available too....
2018-02-08T15:20:57 <simonjb> great
2018-02-08T15:21:31 <simonjb> any venue is good for me (vidyo, skype, hangouts)

2018-02-08T15:40:02 <Bosmon> Shall we SKype?
2018-02-08T15:42:16 <simonjb> Bosmon: sure, call me when it\'s good for you

2018-02-08T16:29:52 <cindyli> gtirloni_: regarding the 404 error at "vagrant up" and "vagrant box update", the vagrantCloud response does solve the problem. now my \'inclusivedesign/fedora26\' is back. but i hit another error at removing centos7 - https://pastebin.com/5DJ5BC2f
2018-02-08T16:29:59 <cindyli> it looks like a different issue tho
2018-02-08T16:30:40 <gtirloni_> looks like you have a box using that
2018-02-08T16:30:46 <gtirloni_> cd /Users/cindyli/Development/gpii/node_modules/universal/vagrant-configs; vagrant destroy
2018-02-08T16:30:49 <cindyli> one thing that might be related is I had 2 centos vm, one with version 1.0.0, the other is the one i\'m removing now. I\'ve removed 1.0.0
2018-02-08T16:31:14 <gtirloni_> you can remove old boxes with: `vagrant box prune`
2018-02-08T16:31:28 <cindyli> yay! works. thanks, gtirloni_
2018-02-08T16:31:34 <cindyli> nice
2018-02-08T16:31:36 <gtirloni_> :)
