2018-09-07T13:30:02 <the-t-in-rtf> Hi, @clown, just recovering from my last meeting.
2018-09-07T13:30:11 <the-t-in-rtf> Did you get far enough to look at something together today?
2018-09-07T13:30:27 <clown> hey the-t-in-rtf, yes, I got something working, thanks.
2018-09-07T13:30:38 <the-t-in-rtf> Do you still need help?
2018-09-07T13:31:04 <clown> I think a expert's eyes would be a good idea.  :)
2018-09-07T13:31:23 <clown> are you still up for it?
2018-09-07T13:34:03 <clown> *crickets*
2018-09-07T13:34:49 * cindyli has quit
2018-09-07T13:36:43 <clown> the-t-in-rtf:  are you still there?
2018-09-07T13:37:01 <the-t-in-rtf> Sorry, got drawn into another chat.
2018-09-07T13:37:02 <the-t-in-rtf> yes.
2018-09-07T13:37:04 <the-t-in-rtf> Vidyo?
2018-09-07T13:37:40 <the-t-in-rtf> I mean, we don't need cameras, just thinking of screen sharing.
2018-09-07T13:38:02 <clown> sure, okay.  no need to comb my hair then.
2018-09-07T13:38:05 <the-t-in-rtf> it's starting, not sure if I've updated it for the new domain name...
2018-09-07T13:38:25 <the-t-in-rtf> nope, that's why it was churning
2018-09-07T13:39:25 <clown> vidyo is up for me, but it doesn't list e a room with your name on it.  Use my roomk?
2018-09-07T13:39:29 <clown> *room
2018-09-07T13:39:34 <the-t-in-rtf> well, assuming I can get in.
2018-09-07T13:39:45 <the-t-in-rtf> it did change to conf.incd.ca?
2018-09-07T13:40:01 <the-t-in-rtf> churn churn
2018-09-07T13:40:04 * clown checking that
2018-09-07T13:40:13 <the-t-in-rtf> invalid username or password or the account is disabled
2018-09-07T13:40:39 <the-t-in-rtf> that might explain the lack of a named room.
2018-09-07T13:40:39 <clown> conf.inclusivedesign.ca is what I have
2018-09-07T13:40:53 <clown> and, I searched for and found your room.
2018-09-07T13:40:55 * g2szeto joined the channel
2018-09-07T13:41:07 <the-t-in-rtf> I still haven't even been able to connect.
2018-09-07T13:41:09 * cindyli joined the channel
2018-09-07T13:41:12 <the-t-in-rtf> ah, finally.
2018-09-07T13:41:15 <the-t-in-rtf> so, my room?
2018-09-07T13:41:17 <clown> \\o/

2018-09-07T14:04:45 <the-t-in-rtf> vidyo crashed
2018-09-07T14:04:56 <stegru> nice
2018-09-07T14:05:01 <gtirloni> the-t-in-rtf: vidyo should still be conf.inclusivedesign.ca
2018-09-07T14:05:05 <the-t-in-rtf> @clown, heading right back in.
2018-09-07T14:05:13 <the-t-in-rtf> yes, I figured that out, it was just dog slow in responding at first.
2018-09-07T14:05:43 <the-t-in-rtf> no idea why people say that, dogs are not all that slow.
2018-09-07T14:06:38 <gtirloni> sometimes if you logged in from your phone or another OS, then you go back to using your regular vidyo battlestation, it'll take a while to login... no idea what that is but a workaround is to cancel it, it shows the login screen again, then you try again.. sometimes that's faster than just waiting for it to retry and retry and it, probably, invalidates some session thing and start from scratch
2018-09-07T14:06:49 <clown> especially grey hounds
2018-09-07T14:06:51 <the-t-in-rtf> I only ever log in from the desktop app.
2018-09-07T14:07:04 <gtirloni> ok
2018-09-07T14:07:12 <the-t-in-rtf> but maybe it doesn't understand European packets because of the accent.
2018-09-07T14:07:17 <gtirloni> lol
2018-09-07T14:07:41 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyone else have a crash when exiting full screen screenshares?
2018-09-07T14:07:41 * gtirloni will let alanharnum have all the vidyo fun now :)
2018-09-07T14:07:45 <the-t-in-rtf> that's what did me in.
2018-09-07T14:07:45 <stegru> u wot?
2018-09-07T14:08:05 <the-t-in-rtf> well, you can click a screenshare in the center window to make it full screen
2018-09-07T14:08:13 <the-t-in-rtf> but if you try to do the opposite, it crashes.
2018-09-07T14:08:29 <the-t-in-rtf> (on OS X)
2018-09-07T14:08:32 <gtirloni> the-t-in-rtf: yeah, it's a known issue. I think Justin_o hits this frequently https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/INFRA-82
2018-09-07T14:09:15 <the-t-in-rtf> What the mess is VidyoNeo?
2018-09-07T14:09:31 <gtirloni> it's now called VidyoConnect.. it's their Electron app
2018-09-07T14:09:46 <gtirloni> VidyoDesktop being the native client that they don't bother to update anymore :|
2018-09-07T14:09:59 <the-t-in-rtf> https://goo.gl/images/w6uLyQ
2018-09-07T14:10:36 <gtirloni> we had the same feeling, that VidyoNeo was going to solve our problems but it was pretty bad :) I haven't tried VidyoConnect too in a while
2018-09-07T14:11:57 <the-t-in-rtf> Is there a link to download it?
2018-09-07T14:12:06 <the-t-in-rtf> The seem to want you log in to download the clients now.
2018-09-07T14:12:10 <the-t-in-rtf> s/The/They/
2018-09-07T14:13:17 <the-t-in-rtf> ugh.
2018-09-07T14:13:28 <the-t-in-rtf> I can't even update because the update isn't signed?
2018-09-07T14:13:33 <the-t-in-rtf> Is that also a known thing?
2018-09-07T14:13:53 <the-t-in-rtf> Stuck outside of 3.6.14 with the 3.6.12 blues.
2018-09-07T14:14:42 <gtirloni> VidyoConnect would have to be deployed to IDRC servers first, then you'd down it from https://conf.inclusivedesign.ca
2018-09-07T14:14:50 <gtirloni> re: update error, I've no idea

2018-09-07T14:24:27 <the-t-in-rtf> I'm gonna miss you, man.
2018-09-07T14:24:50 <the-t-in-rtf> At least my Vidyo is now as unbroken as I can hope for!
