2018-08-27T09:18:18 <the-t-in-rtf> @javjarfer[m], sorry, finally got to the office.
2018-08-27T09:18:32 <the-t-in-rtf> We can talk whenever you're ready, just let me know when you're around and I'll grab a room.

2018-08-27T10:08:20 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: Hey, Antranig! We have started addressing your comments for the QSS PR. Can you please clarify what you meant by this comment: https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/pull/48#discussion_r212614052
2018-08-27T10:09:49 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: Also, we have some guard clauses, for example here: https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/pull/48/files#diff-3bf9e3b06646394fee1768e9e554f1deR76
2018-08-27T10:10:21 <georgitodorov> It will be good if we test them somehow. Can you recommend a mechanism for doing so?

2018-08-27T10:54:17 <the-t-in-rtf> Hi, @georgitodorov, in my own work I test failure states using this function:
2018-08-27T10:54:18 <the-t-in-rtf> https://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/jqUnit.html#jqunitexpectframeworkdiagnosticmessage-toinvoke-errortexts
2018-08-27T10:55:16 <the-t-in-rtf> you could define a grade with bad options or that will otherwise have the problem, and then pass that as toInvoke
2018-08-27T10:56:46 <the-t-in-rtf> since you're using fluid.fail, that mechanism should work for you.
2018-08-27T11:35:15 <georgitodorov> the-t-in-rtf: Thank you, Tony!
2018-08-27T11:48:20 <the-t-in-rtf> You are very welcome
2018-08-27T11:48:35 <the-t-in-rtf> I asked so many questions like that when I was learning, it is the very least I can do to return the favour.
2018-08-27T11:50:03 <the-t-in-rtf> @javjarfer[m], I'm still available to chat if you're around.
2018-08-27T11:50:16 <the-t-in-rtf> otherwise I will nudge the invite to later in the week and we can keep trying.

2018-08-27T22:06:51 <sgithens> Bosmon stegru or anyone. Do you know what script we used to provision all the keys from the demo spreadsheet in to Javi's aws cloud for the audit? Was it part of the gpii-dataloader, or some other command line script used with the spreadsheet?
2018-08-27T22:23:06 <Bosmon> stegru - there was no script
2018-08-27T22:31:08 * danayo_ has quit
2018-08-27T22:45:38 <sgithens> Bosmon : did they use the dataloader?  They didn't manually create like 125 couch db documents using fauxton did they?
2018-08-27T22:46:02 <Bosmon> sgithens - there are not 125 of them
2018-08-27T22:46:20 <Bosmon> And I believe he just used curl for the very few that there actually are
2018-08-27T22:47:22 <sgithens> Bosmon: there are 82 rows in this list, and each one requires 2 couch documents at a minimum
2018-08-27T22:47:39 <Bosmon> Yes but they are not actually all there
2018-08-27T22:47:44 <Bosmon> To the best of my knowledge
2018-08-27T22:48:16 <sgithens> Well, I randomly picked the #38th one to use as my own, and it was already on javi's cluster
2018-08-27T22:48:28 <sgithens> so still, that's a lot of couch documenets
2018-08-27T22:48:56 <Bosmon> ok, wow
2018-08-27T22:49:25 <Bosmon> OK, well we'll have to ask him
2018-08-27T22:49:44 <Bosmon> The last time we talked he was only planning to provision 10 of them
2018-08-27T22:49:50 <Bosmon> And to use a curl script to do it
2018-08-27T22:51:08 * danayo has quit
2018-08-27T22:53:04 <sgithens> Bosmon: He being jhernandez?
2018-08-27T22:53:11 <Bosmon> Him indeed
2018-08-27T22:53:14 <sgithens> I'll ping him in the morning
2018-08-27T22:53:22 <Bosmon> He's away for 2 weeks
2018-08-27T22:53:27 <sgithens> and maybe get them all proviionsed before my meeting
2018-08-27T22:53:39 <sgithens> oh wait
2018-08-27T22:53:55 <sgithens> I think he's out
