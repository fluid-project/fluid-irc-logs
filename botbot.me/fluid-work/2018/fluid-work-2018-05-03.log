2018-05-03T10:18:11 <yuriy__> Bosmon: Hi, Antranig! I wanted to let you know that Gregg and Bern decided that the click outside user setting should be part of the MVIP for PSP. I created a task for the client side changes (https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2988), which we have started work on. When the change is ready on the core\'s end we will hook it up. Until then we will use the default behavior of closing the panel.
2018-05-03T10:29:51 * jeevan_ has quit
2018-05-03T10:39:37 <Bosmon> yuriy__ - sure, we can add a new preference to core and then we can onboard the PSP
2018-05-03T10:39:43 <Bosmon> Once we have kasparnet\'s pull out of the way
2018-05-03T10:41:11 <yuriy__> OK, thank you

2018-05-03T13:58:20 <Bosmon> Hi there Justin_o - I\'m looking at the "Inclusive Cities" page which colinclark shared with me
2018-05-03T13:58:42 <Bosmon> THere seems to be a touch of load jank I\'m guessing which is caused by one of UIO\'s default rules which perhaps there might be a straightforward way of getting rid of
2018-05-03T13:59:17 <Bosmon> I notice that there is a default line-height of 1.2 assigned to body.fl-theme-prefsEditor-default, which causes the page title to jank up a bit as it is applied
2018-05-03T14:00:25 <Bosmon> There\'a also the standard jank about the initial text on the "show preferences" button
2018-05-03T14:00:31 <Bosmon> Which I think we have had in other contexts
2018-05-03T14:01:02 * alanharnum joined the channel
2018-05-03T14:02:25 <Justin_o> Bosmon: hello
2018-05-03T14:03:10 <Justin_o> i\'ll take a look
2018-05-03T14:07:19 * neuralmilkhotel joined the channel
2018-05-03T14:25:41 <Justin_o> Bosmon: so it doesn\'t look like it\'s related to .fl-theme-prefsEditor-default but rather to the line space enactor https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/preferences/js/Enactors.js#L319-L323
2018-05-03T14:26:07 <Bosmon> Justin_o - interesting
2018-05-03T14:26:17 <Bosmon> I assumed it was since when I removed the rule, the jank went back
2018-05-03T14:26:20 * georgitodorov has quit
2018-05-03T14:26:37 <Justin_o> oh that\'s interesting.. what i\'m seeing is that it\'s an inline style
2018-05-03T14:27:08 <Justin_o> Bosmon: so i\'m thinking that the line-height multiplier should probably default to 1 and not 1.2 but will probably need further investigation
2018-05-03T14:30:09 <Justin_o> or perhaps undefined would be better because we probably shouldn\'t set any value i it\'s normal
2018-05-03T14:33:44 * michelled joined the channel
2018-05-03T14:37:50 <Bosmon> It might be an inline style... all I meant was that I removed it in Chrome\'s dev tools
2018-05-03T14:44:42 * danayo joined the channel
2018-05-03T14:46:25 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay.. is this something that we should file a JIRA for against the prefs framework?
2018-05-03T14:47:14 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I think so, if it looks like a core prefs framework issue
2018-05-03T14:47:21 <Bosmon> Any idea why it defaults to 1.2 rather than 1?
2018-05-03T14:49:58 <Justin_o> Bosmon: there was a note in the code that points to https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/line-height
2018-05-03T14:50:20 <Justin_o> which says
2018-05-03T14:50:26 <Justin_o> normal
2018-05-03T14:50:27 <Justin_o> Depends on the user agent. Desktop browsers (including Firefox) use a default value of roughly 1.2, depending on the element\'s font-family.
2018-05-03T14:50:54 <Bosmon> Gah
2018-05-03T14:50:56 <Bosmon> "roughly 1.2" : P

2018-05-03T14:52:03 * yuriy__ joined the channel
2018-05-03T14:53:39 <Justin_o> yes :( rather unfortunate that these things are font dependent... I\'m guessing we can use 1.2 as the default multiplier but not set but just not set anything in the case that no line-height preference is specified
2018-05-03T15:02:19 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, I think that the "zero-jank" use case is an important one since it will be by far be the most common experience of interacting with UIO
2018-05-03T15:02:29 <Bosmon> THat is, the most common interaction will be to not use it
