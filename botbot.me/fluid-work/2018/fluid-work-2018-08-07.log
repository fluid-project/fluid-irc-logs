2018-08-07T14:09:09 <Justin_o> and also still need to get the captions working

2018-08-07T14:39:11 <Justin_o> Bosmon, jhernandez: I've published a new beta of UIO+. It will probably be available from the chrome web store in about an hour. I'm still working on fixing some test infrastructure and captions so this only includes the changes to text size/zoom, captions, and text-to-speech.
2018-08-07T14:39:19 <Justin_o> and the dictionary removal

2018-08-07T15:34:46 <dandimitrov> Bosmon, jhernandez: So should I leave the shorter version path? That way the application won\xe2\x80\x99t be crashing when using noUser, but changes from QSS won\xe2\x80\x99t be applied when logged in with snapset_2a as well...
2018-08-07T15:35:57 <Bosmon> dandimitrov - yes, I think that is best for the short term

2018-08-07T15:54:51 <dandimitrov> jhernandez: I tested our \xe2\x80\x9cRevert QSS when user keys out\xe2\x80\x9d functionality with your `feds-audit` branch and everythings looked well. I\xe2\x80\x99ve pushed everything to our feature/QSS branch in case a build with it is required
2018-08-07T15:56:23 <jhernandez> dandimitrov: oh, sorry, I was not in front of this computer
2018-08-07T15:56:32 <jhernandez> thanks for the updates on your branch
2018-08-07T15:57:03 <jhernandez> I will pull from them, so no need for you to open a pr against the feds-audit branches
2018-08-07T15:57:53 <dandimitrov> jhernandez: Great, if I can help with anything just ping me : )

2018-08-07T16:14:41 <dandimitrov> Bosmon: Regarding this PR https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/pull/46 , do we still need the `gpii-windows` update or we can merge the PR without it :? It was something that was left aside as there were more ergent tasks\xe2\x80\xa6
2018-08-07T16:17:05 <gtirloni_> fluid-everyone: GPII's JIRA is back now
2018-08-07T16:17:15 <Bosmon> danayo - well, obviously it needs to be tested against the current trunk of gpii-windows : P
2018-08-07T16:17:21 <Bosmon> sorry danayo I meant dandimitrov

2018-08-07T16:19:47 <Bosmon> I think it only makes sense to merge pulls in the downstream repositories against the most recent releases of the upstream ones

2018-08-07T16:24:03 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf:  thanks for looking into the testem issue for me, and sorry about forgetting to add the build to the test setup. I've switched that to use the pre-built infusion-all instead. The individual files were already being referenced so that all stayed the same. However, it's still not working through testem. I'm getting the same problem

2018-08-07T16:28:18 <gtirloni> fluid-everyone: it's was/is a known bug in some versions of JIRA that the logo would be lost in an upgrade and the color scheme changes too. I've uploaded a GPII logo I had here but I don't remember if that's the one that was used. Unfortunately there's no fix for this (Fluid's JIRA went through the same). So if anyone has a logo and a color scheme they think look better, please let me know and I can change it in JIRA
2018-08-07T16:29:53 <stegru> well!

2018-08-07T16:31:23 <Bosmon> Yet another horrific change in style

2018-08-07T19:08:03 <klown> colinclark:  getting closer, but there are at least two issues to solve.
2018-08-07T19:08:18 <klown> how much detail do you want?
2018-08-07T19:09:01 <colinclark> mostly i'm interesting in what our next steps are, and if we're going to make the deadline
2018-08-07T19:10:32 <klown> my next steps are to fix the two issues.  One of them should be do-able in about a day.  The other I just discovered, and am trying to figure out what the error message means and why it happens.
