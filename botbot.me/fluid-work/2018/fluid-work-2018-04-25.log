2018-04-25T16:35:05 <clown> jhernandez_: , dandimitrov Here's the console:  https://ci.gpii.net/job/gpii-app-test/219/console
2018-04-25T16:35:27 <clown> scrollling to the bottom indicates some json parsing error.
2018-04-25T16:35:43 <clown> beyond that, I haven't looked any closer.

2018-04-25T16:46:12 <jhernandez_> *are passing
2018-04-25T16:46:59 <dandimitrov> jhernandez_: I've run only gpii-app tests (not universal ones) and they are passing
2018-04-25T16:48:30 <jhernandez_> okay, let's give CI another chance to pass them and see what happens
2018-04-25T16:48:54 * christinehu has quit
2018-04-25T16:49:27 <jhernandez_> if they keep failing, I'll pull your changes and try locally if I get the same

2018-04-25T14:09:27 <avtar> looks like they have a stagnant (last commit from two years ago) repo for testem integration https://github.com/browserstack/testem-browserstack

2018-04-25T14:19:43 <Bosmon> avtar, gtirloni - did we ever get to the bottom of that stalling buildkite issue?
2018-04-25T14:21:44 <Justin_o> Bosmon: out of curiousity can a a grade added via contextAwareness itself contain contextAwareness checks?
2018-04-25T14:22:28 <avtar> Bosmon: "stalling" as in github statuses not being updated?
2018-04-25T14:22:39 <gtirloni> Bosmon: stalling? right it\'s running with concurrency level = 1 so it\'d wait for a previous build to finish. we have a jira to improve on that
2018-04-25T14:22:43 <Bosmon> Justin_o - no, it can\'t
2018-04-25T14:22:46 <Justin_o> i\'m exploring a failing test case and notice that we have a situation where there are sort of two tests to see if we should run some of the tests and wondering if i can do them all as a context awareness checks
2018-04-25T14:22:46 <Bosmon> avtar, yes, that
2018-04-25T14:22:50 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay
2018-04-25T14:23:00 <Bosmon> Justin_o - the contextAwareness block is evaluated only once
2018-04-25T14:23:18 <Bosmon> It will be responsive to grades added as direct arguments, and via options distributions
2018-04-25T14:23:23 <Bosmon> But not via its own action
2018-04-25T14:23:42 <avtar> Bosmon: gtirloni heard back from their support team:
2018-04-25T14:23:51 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay, i mean that\'s probably the safest approach really
2018-04-25T14:23:52 <avtar> "We\'ve turned on a new version of our github commit status updater for your org. It should mitigate the issue you are seeing."
2018-04-25T14:24:02 <gtirloni> ah the PR updates thing yeah
2018-04-25T14:24:11 <Bosmon> avtar - thanks, that\'s pretty interesting
2018-04-25T14:24:54 <Bosmon> Justin_o - well, it\'s not so much an issue of what is safe, as what is possible : P
2018-04-25T14:25:00 <Bosmon> Could you describe what you were trying to do?
2018-04-25T14:25:22 <Bosmon> It would actually be really helpful if you could just put a thumbnail in a JIRA, even if we can\'t in the end implement it quite the way you were hoping
2018-04-25T14:25:36 <Bosmon> The "closure" of the contextAwareness feature is a pretty interesting issue
2018-04-25T14:28:31 <Justin_o> Bosmon: sure, i\'ll write up a JIRA about it
2018-04-25T14:28:43 <Bosmon> Cheers Justin_o, that will be really interesting
