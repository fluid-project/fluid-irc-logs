b'2018-02-16T19:54:24 * mrtyler joined the channel
2018-02-16T19:54:26 <cindyli> then the pcp channel tests fail
2018-02-16T19:54:32 <cindyli> but they should actually failed earlier
2018-02-16T19:54:43 <Bosmon> It is actually Kasper\'s : P
2018-02-16T19:54:58 <cindyli> right
2018-02-16T19:55:19 <cindyli> but anyway, the model had been in these missing-value state before the "liveness"
2018-02-16T19:55:29 <Bosmon> ok
2018-02-16T19:55:32 <Bosmon> Makes no sense
2018-02-16T19:55:35 <cindyli> but the test only assert "preferences" so it\'s not discovered
2018-02-16T19:55:57 * avtar has quit
2018-02-16T19:56:09 <Bosmon> The system can\'t function without solutionsRegistryEntries
2018-02-16T19:56:15 <Bosmon> You can see them being used in the workflow here: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/lifecycleManager/src/LifecycleManager.js#L186
2018-02-16T19:56:21 <Bosmon> So you will have to track down where they have gone
2018-02-16T19:56:27 <cindyli> i agree
2018-02-16T19:56:51 <Bosmon> You will probably have to step back to your last good state before the merge
2018-02-16T19:56:56 <Bosmon> Because you are dealing with too many problems at once
2018-02-16T19:56:57 <cindyli> solutionsRegistryEntries still appear anywhere else, but somehow not in pcp channel
2018-02-16T19:57:02 <Bosmon> Oh, I see
2018-02-16T19:58:06 <Bosmon> Well, that doesn\'t seem possible either
2018-02-16T19:58:19 <Bosmon> Here is the session binder distribution: https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/GPII-2630/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/src/PCPChannel.js#L76
2018-02-16T19:58:44 <Bosmon> This relay rule is attached directly to the lifecycleManager\'s session: https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/GPII-2630/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/src/PCPChannel.js#L12
2018-02-16T19:59:05 <Bosmon> So the model you see in gpii.pcpChannel.sessionToPCP *is* the lifecycleManager\'s model
2018-02-16T19:59:10 <Bosmon> There is no possibility they can diverge
2018-02-16T19:59:33 <Bosmon> btw have you started using node 8.x and the new built-in inspector?
2018-02-16T19:59:35 <Bosmon> It is very good
2018-02-16T19:59:44 <cindyli> adding a debugging into FlowManagerRequests
2018-02-16T19:59:52 <Bosmon> It may speed up your debugging a lot
2018-02-16T20:02:10 <Bosmon> cindyli ^
2018-02-16T20:03:23 <cindyli> Bosmon: it does help, solution registry entries become empty {} after the filtering: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/src/FlowManagerRequests.js#L91, debugging more
2018-02-16T20:05:27 <Bosmon> cindyli - looks like it is a device reporter issue
2018-02-16T20:05:36 <Bosmon> There has been no change in the code in this area
2018-02-16T20:05:38 <Bosmon> In recent pulls
2018-02-16T20:05:53 <cindyli> ok
2018-02-16T20:05:58 <Bosmon> But something in your pull may be supplying the wrong device info
2018-02-16T20:06:04 <Bosmon> And hence all the solutions are getting filtered out
2018-02-16T20:06:50 <Bosmon> What test case are you running?
2018-02-16T20:10:54 <Bosmon> Hey jhernandez - the pulls are looking good
2018-02-16T20:13:19 <cindyli> Bosmon: i think i found the problem, the master is reading device info from linux.json5, but my branch is reading from darwin.json
2018-02-16T20:13:26 <cindyli> running this test: https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/GPII-2630/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/test/PCPChannelTests.js#L426-L430
2018-02-16T20:13:36 <Bosmon> ha
2018-02-16T20:13:38 <cindyli> looking into the config file
2018-02-16T20:13:52 <Bosmon> Well ok, this test has a bug then in any case
2018-02-16T20:14:01 <Bosmon> Since it should be using mock info for the device reporter
2018-02-16T20:14:36 <cindyli> which device file is correct to be read from?
2018-02-16T20:14:56 <cindyli> linux.json5, right?
2018-02-16T20:15:19 <Bosmon> The testCaseHolder has this definition:     gradeNames: [
2018-02-16T20:15:19 <Bosmon> "gpii.test.integration.testCaseHolder.linux"
2018-02-16T20:15:19 <Bosmon> ],
2018-02-16T20:15:26 <Bosmon> So yes, there is no way you should be reading from darwin.json
2018-02-16T20:16:23 <cindyli> ok. looking into that grade
2018-02-16T20:17:18 <Bosmon> Also check out the base config "gpii.tests.acceptance.linux.builtIn.config"
2018-02-16T20:18:25 <Bosmon> I see that this is responsible for populating the "installedSolutions" within the device reporter
2018-02-16T20:19:24 <Bosmon> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/tests/platform/linux/configs/gpii.tests.acceptance.linux.builtIn.config.json
2018-02-16T20:19:29 <Bosmon> So check whether something has gone wrong with this as well
2018-02-16T20:20:11 <Bosmon> Although I guess this isn\'t relevant
2018-02-16T20:21:15 <jhernandez> Bosmon: yes, we\'re all set (I\'ve just updated gpii-app)
2018-02-16T20:22:27 <cindyli> Bosmon: what determines which solution file to fetch, the "deviceContext" in this test looks like
2018-02-16T20:22:28 <cindyli> { solutions:
2018-02-16T20:22:28 <cindyli> [ { id: \'org.gnome.desktop.interface\' },
2018-02-16T20:22:28 <cindyli> { id: \'org.gnome.desktop.a11y.magnifier\' },
2018-02-16T20:22:28 <cindyli> { id: \'org.alsa-project\' },
2018-02-16T20:22:28 <cindyli> { id: \'org.gnome.desktop.a11y.keyboard\' } ],
2018-02-16T20:22:28 <cindyli> OS: { id: \'darwin\', version: \'15.6.0\' } }
2018-02-16T20:22:39 <cindyli> OS.id === "darwin"
2018-02-16T20:22:48 <Bosmon> cindyli - something has gone horribly wrong
2018-02-16T20:23:01 <Bosmon> cindyli - here is the mock device reporter which should be in effect: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/testing/src/Mocks.js#L137
2018-02-16T20:23:04 <cindyli> is that where darwin.json is picked?
2018-02-16T20:23:13 <Bosmon> These are the testCaseHolders
2018-02-16T20:24:10 <cindyli> so?
2018-02-16T20:24:18 <Bosmon> cindyli - so for example you should be using "gpii.test.integration.testCaseHolder.linux"
2018-02-16T20:24:48 <Bosmon> Which is defined here: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/testing/src/Integration.js#L30
2018-02-16T20:25:12 <Bosmon> Which should then enable this mock platformReporter: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/testing/src/Mocks.js#L137
2018-02-16T20:25:57 <Bosmon> Somehow in your branch you have broken the connection between this mock definition and the deviceReporter which is made here: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/testing/src/Mocks.js#L72
2018-02-16T20:26:09 <Bosmon> And you have ended up somehow with the real deviceReporter rather than the mock one
2018-02-16T20:26:23 <Bosmon> So I suggest you look around changes you have made in this area to see where the connection got broken
2018-02-16T20:26:27 <cindyli> ok i se

2018-02-16T21:29:22 <cindyli> Bosmon: problem solved. was caused by a silly redundant line. this stupid one line costs me more than A DAY to debug\xe2\x80\xa6 my goodness. glad it\'s out of the way. thanks for the super effective help. cheers!
2018-02-16T21:30:17 <Bosmon> cindyli - great
2018-02-16T21:30:19 <Bosmon> What was the line?
2018-02-16T21:30:38 <cindyli> pushing the change ..
2018-02-16T21:30:51 * michelled joined the channel
2018-02-16T21:30:56 <Bosmon> jhernandez - fantastic we are all merged up with gpii-universal!
2018-02-16T21:31:29 <cindyli> Bosmon: https://github.com/cindyli/universal/commit/32d891a0a45bfe45eac5ee27a52d8dfe2a6720d2
2018-02-16T21:31:50 <Bosmon> I guess we can try to ............. PPPUBBLISHE!
2018-02-16T21:32:00 <Bosmon> Let\'s check that our README looks halfway sane first
2018-02-16T21:33:18 <cindyli> in short, gpii.test.pouch.pouchTestCaseHolder grade cannot be added more than once thru different means
2018-02-16T21:33:56 <Bosmon> cindyli - Well, it could, if you just fixed up the function on line 445 to merge the gradeNames rather than trash it
2018-02-16T21:35:35 <cindyli> which function do you mean? kettle.test.bootstrapServer?
2018-02-16T21:35:47 <Bosmon> cindyli - but if this a general requirement for all new test fixtures of this kind, shouldn\'t it be added to the core definitions in Mocks.js rather than just one time here?
2018-02-16T21:35:56 <Bosmon> Presumably you are having to add this all over the place
2018-02-16T21:37:15 <cindyli> Bosmon: it\'s been added to integration test case holder - https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/GPII-2630/gpii/node_modules/testing/src/Integration.js#L23
2018-02-16T21:37:30 <cindyli> but for those that are not using this test case holder, it needs to be manually added
2018-02-16T21:38:03 <Bosmon> cindyli - ah
2018-02-16T21:38:49 <Bosmon> cindyli - it seems cleaner to add one of those relevant grades at line 315 as well
2018-02-16T21:39:58 <Bosmon> Sticking it in the PCPCHannelTests seems like an unwelcome intrusion of an implementation detail
2018-02-16T21:41:20 <cindyli> i believe you didn\'t mean this line 315 - https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/GPII-2630/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/test/PCPChannelTests.js#L315
2018-02-16T21:42:03 <Bosmon> No this one https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/32d891a0a45bfe45eac5ee27a52d8dfe2a6720d2/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/test/PCPChannelTests.js#L315
2018-02-16T21:44:36 <cindyli> Bosmon: i see. instead of sticking into the integration test case holder at here - https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/GPII-2630/gpii/node_modules/testing/src/Integration.js#L23
2018-02-16T21:44:43 <cindyli> ok, i can make that chang

2018-02-16T22:13:31 <jhernandez> but yeah, probably we should review the READMEs and anything else related to the actual publishing process
2018-02-16T22:14:53 <jhernandez> not sure since I\'ve never published in npm before, but once I created a gpii-universal.zip with fluid-publish and it "looked" very straigthforward
2018-02-16T22:15:48 <jhernandez> unfortunately, I have no more time today
2018-02-16T22:16:26 <jhernandez> in any case, let me know if you want me to do anything over the weekendd
2018-02-16T22:18:00 <jhernandez> dunno, update a README file, perform a check, test, etc

b'2018-02-16T12:15:05 <Bosmon> Anyway, an ecosystem depending on a gpii-launcher which has kettle updated to 1.7.1 would be great
2018-02-16T12:15:19 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: We removed the priorities and everything is working fine, including the tests.
2018-02-16T12:15:25 <Bosmon> georgitodorov - magnificent :)
2018-02-16T12:15:30 <georgitodorov> But there is one "but", of course
2018-02-16T12:15:31 <Bosmon> And jhernandez - thanks for updating your branch
2018-02-16T12:15:36 <Bosmon> Eagerly awaiting the results of CI
2018-02-16T12:15:45 <Bosmon> The joint is jumping on a Friday afternoon
2018-02-16T12:15:52 <Bosmon> And the east coast hasn\'t even woken up yet :)
2018-02-16T12:16:21 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: The only thing left is to ensure that the pspReady subcomponent is always initialized last
2018-02-16T12:16:22 <the-t-in-rtf> Ah, crud, I merged the branch under review into the "secret" branch, let me close that pull out and create a new one.
2018-02-16T12:16:53 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: Currently it is the last defined subcomponent and it does not have any dependency on any of the other subcomponents
2018-02-16T12:17:06 <georgitodorov> I guess it is just a coincidence that it is initialized last
2018-02-16T12:17:22 <Bosmon> georgitodorov - ok, in this case I suggest that you eliminate the pspReady subcomponent and replace it with a further event boiling
2018-02-16T12:17:32 <Bosmon> Since it is just a synthetic component anyway
2018-02-16T12:18:17 <Bosmon> Or, really, you can just add a listener on onPSPPrequisitesReady with a priority of "last" which just fires onoPSPReady
2018-02-16T12:18:44 <Bosmon> This will guarantee to fire after all subcomponents are created (at least, in the current framework, but will be easy to fix up in future)
2018-02-16T12:19:07 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: Hmm, I thought there was some issue with "priority:last" and it was not working as expected
2018-02-16T12:19:10 <jhernandez> Bosmon: heh, my pleasure - let\'s see if we don\'t expose any other funky stuff :P
2018-02-16T12:19:13 <jhernandez> the big bang is here!
2018-02-16T12:19:15 <jhernandez> :)
2018-02-16T12:19:20 <Bosmon> georgitodorov - I hope not, let\'s see
2018-02-16T12:19:31 <Bosmon> jhernandez - well, at least we are lighting the touchpaper of the big bang .....
2018-02-16T12:19:44 <Bosmon> The next step after the whole tree is ready is to move all references over to npm
2018-02-16T12:19:51 <jhernandez> Bosmon: indeed!
2018-02-16T12:20:08 <jhernandez> and yes, looking forward to start publishing our modules
2018-02-16T12:20:11 <jhernandez> :)
2018-02-16T12:20:22 <Bosmon> Yes, we will finally be entering the 20th century
2018-02-16T12:23:18 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: The "last" listener works like a charm :)
2018-02-16T12:23:30 <Bosmon> georgitodorov - awesome
2018-02-16T12:23:47 <Bosmon> OK, I will tinker with the pull this afternoon and hopefully it can go in ...

2018-02-16T15:17:27 <dandimitrov> But it probably be better if asked him :

2018-02-16T15:23:33 <the-t-in-rtf> I didn\'t quite have enough time to go all the way through the stack, and my hours are nearly done for the week.  I will make a note of packages needing updates to work on on Monday morning.
2018-02-16T15:26:05 <the-t-in-rtf> Just trying to get a sense of which (if any) are urgent.

2018-02-16T17:33:43 <jhernandez> Bosmon: yeah, it passed. I was double checking here locally before pushing updates on win and gpii-app but I\'m getting a failure here
2018-02-16T17:35:05 <Bosmon> oh, what is it?
2018-02-16T17:35:12 <jhernandez> re-npm installing, not sure what\'s going on
2018-02-16T17:35:27 <jhernandez> I\'ll let you know if I get the same error
2018-02-16T17:36:43 <jhernandez> I can\'t run the acceptance tests on windows after updating the universal ref to current universal/master (it was pointing to my GPII-2568)
2018-02-16T17:37:23 <jhernandez> weird, since I updated it yesterday with last master, so, it shouldn\'t be any difference between these two
2018-02-16T17:38:02 <jhernandez> okay, now they are running
2018-02-16T17:39:56 <Bosmon> excellent
2018-02-16T17:40:12 <Bosmon> Yes, npm usually screws up on subtleties like changing a version of a head package that is also used by dependencies
2018-02-16T17:42:19 <jhernandez> yes, looks like it was that

2018-02-16T19:26:23 <cindyli> hi Bosmon, i\'ve been debugging this pcp channel issue for hours and still puzzled. I wonder if you could shed some light. This problem is something wrong with PCPChannelTests in my GPII-2630 branch, in particularly these two tests: https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/GPII-2630/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/test/PCPChannelTests.js#L426-L437
2018-02-16T19:26:49 <cindyli> the trace shows the `model` value received in this function is wrong: https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/GPII-2630/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/src/PCPChannel.js#L186
2018-02-16T19:27:00 <cindyli> the correct model value looks like: https://pastebin.com/yaXD8qXJ
2018-02-16T19:27:12 <cindyli> in GPII-2630 branch, it looks like: https://pastebin.com/5S7wgWPK
2018-02-16T19:28:04 <cindyli> notice the missing values for "originalSettings", "appliedSolutions", "solutionsRegistryEntries" and "activeConfiguration.inferredConfiguration.applications"
2018-02-16T19:29:48 <cindyli> i\'m now tracing into the lifecycle manager for the population of these values, but haven\'t found the place
2018-02-16T19:29:54 <cindyli> any ideas?
2018-02-16T19:44:04 <Bosmon> cindyli - what work have you done in your branch?
2018-02-16T19:44:28 <cindyli> Bosmon: implement the new data model
2018-02-16T19:44:46 <cindyli> lots of files have been touched but not much on pcp channel
2018-02-16T19:44:55 <cindyli> let me paste a comparison
2018-02-16T19:45:20 <Bosmon> Well, I see that all the solutionsRegistryEntries are gone
2018-02-16T19:45:23 <Bosmon> Which is pretty severe
2018-02-16T19:45:37 <Bosmon> But I can\'t really think how you could have lost it
2018-02-16T19:45:51 <Bosmon> There\'s no way the system could function without them
2018-02-16T19:45:59 <cindyli> oh no, are they in testData/ folder?
2018-02-16T19:46:09 <Bosmon> cindyli - in your payloads that you pasted
2018-02-16T19:46:09 <cindyli> https://github.com/cindyli/universal/compare/GPII-2558...cindyli:GPII-2630
2018-02-16T19:46:15 <cindyli> right right
2018-02-16T19:46:16 <Bosmon> You sent two pastebins
2018-02-16T19:46:24 <cindyli> ya, also wondering why
2018-02-16T19:47:02 <cindyli> is it the lifecycle manager that populate these data into the pcp channel model?
2018-02-16T19:47:18 <Bosmon> cindyli - does the logon actually proceed correctly?
2018-02-16T19:47:30 <Bosmon> As far as I can tell, you would receive the most awful errors
2018-02-16T19:47:54 <cindyli> yes, i think
2018-02-16T19:47:54 <Bosmon> Anyway, the solutionsRegistryEntries are fetched here: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/src/FlowManagerRequests.js#L91
2018-02-16T19:48:15 <cindyli> ok, digging...
2018-02-16T19:48:17 <Bosmon> You should then see them pass into the "final payload" here: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/src/FlowManagerRequests.js#L103
2018-02-16T19:49:09 <Bosmon> They then enter the session here: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/lifecycleManager/src/LifecycleManager.js#L696

2018-02-16T19:49:20 * michelled has quit
2018-02-16T19:49:29 <Bosmon> You can see that solutionsRegistryEntries are explicitly selected to appear in the session
2018-02-16T19:49:39 <Bosmon> So if they are gone, there has been some appalling problem
2018-02-16T19:50:06 <cindyli> :\'( what did i break
2018-02-16T19:50:36 <Bosmon> But I can\'t believe that if they are gone by the time you get to this line https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/GPII-2630/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/src/PCPChannel.js#L186 - that the logon can continue properly
2018-02-16T19:51:09 <cindyli> well it continues until you add in "liveness"
2018-02-16T19:51:12 <cindyli> ;)
2018-02-16T19:51:17 <Bosmon> cindyli - this diff is pretty hard to read
2018-02-16T19:51:28 <Bosmon> Why is it based on GPII-2558 rather than trunk?
2018-02-16T19:51:43 <cindyli> 2558 is based on the trunk
2018-02-16T19:51:59 <cindyli> i think you may not be interested in 2558 changes
2018-02-16T19:52:03 <Bosmon> This diff touches 512 files
2018-02-16T19:52:08 <cindyli> exactly
2018-02-16T19:52:09 <Bosmon> Perhaps you have a more focused one? : P
2018-02-16T19:52:25 <cindyli> a lot of files are focused ones
2018-02-16T19:52:42 <cindyli> the prefs server is completely rewritten
2018-02-16T19:52:52 <cindyli> and auth server has been changed too
2018-02-16T19:52:59 <cindyli> i guess those are the main focus in this branch
2018-02-16T19:53:21 <cindyli> also the renaming of "userToken" -> "gpiiKey" and some other renamings on prefs safe etc
2018-02-16T19:53:47 <cindyli> you will review this branch when it becomes a pull request. GOOD LUCK!
2018-02-16T19:53:56 <Bosmon> Do you have any test cases passing?
2018-02-16T19:54:17 <cindyli> all tests are now passing, until i merged in your "liveness" implementation

2018-02-16T08:56:22 <kasparnet> I guess we\'ll now in 20 mins when the CI has done its thing

2018-02-16T10:10:02 <the-t-in-rtf> Morning.  @Bosmon, is there dev release with the merged fix from @kasparnet?
2018-02-16T10:10:24 <the-t-in-rtf> Hoping to verify that the coverage works end to end in the universal pull.
2018-02-16T10:12:06 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - kasparnet\'s latest fix is just to universal
2018-02-16T10:12:18 <Bosmon> HIs fix to infusion is already in the latest dev release of that
2018-02-16T10:12:49 <Bosmon> You can just merge up your coverage work with the latest trunk of universal
2018-02-16T10:20:18 <the-t-in-rtf> Awesome, thanks.
2018-02-16T10:31:12 <the-t-in-rtf> Works fine for me, "npm test" now results in a combined coverage report.

2018-02-16T10:45:35 <the-t-in-rtf> Thanks for the quick fix, Kasper.
2018-02-16T10:45:42 <the-t-in-rtf> So nice to go into the weekend with that working.
2018-02-16T10:52:36 <Bosmon> That\'s fantastic, the-t-in-rtf!
2018-02-16T10:53:16 <the-t-in-rtf> I know, I was kind of hopelessly clinging to that last possibility early in the week, glad it highlighted a way forward.
2018-02-16T10:54:31 <Bosmon> Remind me what the two crucial elements were?
2018-02-16T10:54:37 <Bosmon> i) passing the local "require" to fluid.require
2018-02-16T10:54:51 <Bosmon> ii) getting the negated exclude expression right?
2018-02-16T10:54:55 <the-t-in-rtf> Yes.
2018-02-16T10:54:55 <Bosmon> Is there anything else?
2018-02-16T10:54:59 <Bosmon> What does ii) look like
2018-02-16T10:55:34 <the-t-in-rtf> Here is the heart of darkness: https://github.com/the-t-in-rtf/universal/blob/GPII-2486/.nycrc#L7
2018-02-16T10:56:14 <the-t-in-rtf> We also ended up with a consistent instrumenter that bypasses the **/node_modules/** craziness.
2018-02-16T10:56:26 <the-t-in-rtf> That means we won\'t end up with the same wrestling match for our browser tests.
2018-02-16T10:56:37 <Bosmon> oh great
2018-02-16T10:56:43 <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. we can sanely describe what\'s in and what\'s out, as well as what\'s source and what isn\'t.
2018-02-16T10:57:02 <Bosmon> Well, halfway sane :)
2018-02-16T10:57:24 <the-t-in-rtf> perhaps "more sanely" would have been better, yes.
2018-02-16T10:57:26 <Bosmon> Perhaps if we add this .rc as a report on that istanbuljs issue, they may take pity on us
2018-02-16T10:57:58 <the-t-in-rtf> Let me do that, as I\'d like to explain why the negated pattern is not a real solution.
2018-02-16T10:58:06 <Bosmon> Awesome, thanks
2018-02-16T10:58:07 <the-t-in-rtf> or not a really nice solution.

2018-02-16T11:36:00 <Bosmon> Hey there georgitodorov, dandimitrov - I think your web view tests are looking great now
2018-02-16T11:36:10 <Bosmon> Shall we try to think of some ways of getting rid of your component priority annotations?
2018-02-16T11:45:04 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: Sure. Our idea of introducing the priorities was to have an event which is fired when the PSP is completely functional. This was needed for the execution of the integration tests.
2018-02-16T11:45:23 <Bosmon> Yes, the event is fine
2018-02-16T11:45:42 <Bosmon> But we need to find other ways of dealing with any interdependencies there might be between the subcomponents
2018-02-16T11:45:59 <Bosmon> Or, most preferably, discovering that there aren\'t any :)
2018-02-16T11:46:41 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: In this particular case, there are a lot of components which are created when the "onPSPPrerequisitesReady" event is fired
2018-02-16T11:47:05 <georgitodorov> Generally, they can initialize in any order if we do not define priorities for them, right?
2018-02-16T11:47:25 <georgitodorov> Thus, we cannot know when all the initializations have finished? Or am I missing something?
2018-02-16T11:47:50 <Bosmon> georgitodorov - if you don\'t specify a priority they will initialise in a "data-driven order"
2018-02-16T11:48:05 <Bosmon> So if a component has a dependency on material in another one, the other will initialise first
2018-02-16T11:48:28 <Bosmon> So for example this priority field is unnecessary: https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/pull/34/files#diff-bc658f47466ba31df21972f46d3f02d4R161
2018-02-16T11:48:36 <Bosmon> Since the component\'s definition has a dependency on "settingsBroker"
2018-02-16T11:48:51 <Bosmon> I suggest we just try getting rid of all the priority fields and see what goes wrong :)
2018-02-16T11:56:04 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - is the JSDocs pull ready to go now?
2018-02-16T11:56:22 <the-t-in-rtf> It\'s ready for review, yes.
2018-02-16T11:57:01 <the-t-in-rtf> I did a global search for the Array.<Type> syntax and fixed that, I hope that it more or less reflects what we\'ve discussed.
2018-02-16T11:57:12 <the-t-in-rtf> It definitely lints, or I couldn\'t have even committed my work.
2018-02-16T11:57:18 <Bosmon> gtirloni - should I direct all buildkite/vagrant questions to avtar?
2018-02-16T11:57:26 <Bosmon> I was wondering what was going on with this build: https://buildkite.com/fluid-project/fluid-infusion/builds/56#b32d77db-ae69-47a2-a621-7352432041f4
2018-02-16T11:57:44 <Bosmon> Somehow the vagrant box for infusion appears to have tried to load kettle
2018-02-16T11:57:48 <Bosmon> Which I can\'t understand why
2018-02-16T11:58:05 <gtirloni> let me check
2018-02-16T11:58:17 <Bosmon> Oh
2018-02-16T11:58:24 <Bosmon> I guess maybe it got mediated via gpii-testem....
2018-02-16T11:59:12 <gtirloni> it\'s basically the same process as in Jenkins, even running on the same machine
2018-02-16T11:59:34 <Bosmon> The buildkite builds run on our own machines?
2018-02-16T11:59:56 <gtirloni> on the IDRC build server, the same used by Jenkins
2018-02-16T12:00:01 <Bosmon> wow
2018-02-16T12:00:15 <Bosmon> So bewildering
2018-02-16T12:00:21 <Bosmon> So buildkite.com is just an orchestrator?
2018-02-16T12:00:30 <gtirloni> yep
2018-02-16T12:00:35 <gtirloni> it uses our machine, yes
2018-02-16T12:00:53 <gtirloni> same as the GitLab work Alfredo has done.. it runs an agent on one of our servers
2018-02-16T12:01:35 <gtirloni> it\'s just a pretty interface and the agent... underneath, it\'s our server with the old vagrant/virtualbox setup
2018-02-16T12:01:57 <Bosmon> I see we\'ve got lots of recent gpii-testems - the-t-in-rtf, should I try 2.0.0-dev.20180201T132658Z.df2069a ?
2018-02-16T12:02:39 <the-t-in-rtf> The last 2-3 mainly include improvements to the instrumentation, but yes, the most recent is the best to use.
2018-02-16T12:02:43 <the-t-in-rtf> and that is the most recent.
2018-02-16T12:02:49 <the-t-in-rtf> @Bosmon ^^^
2018-02-16T12:03:03 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - it binds to a heinously old revision of infusion
2018-02-16T12:03:12 <Bosmon> Could we have a dep update version?
2018-02-16T12:03:14 <the-t-in-rtf> Give me a moment.
2018-02-16T12:03:15 <the-t-in-rtf> yup.
2018-02-16T12:03:19 <Bosmon> awesome
2018-02-16T12:03:43 <Bosmon> We need to get the whole tree to a version which cuts out all versions of infusion prior to 201711
2018-02-16T12:04:16 <the-t-in-rtf> OK, that\'s a good one for a Friday afternoon, will write up a ticket before getting my lunch.
2018-02-16T12:04:21 <Bosmon> I think your gpii-express is good
2018-02-16T12:04:44 <Bosmon> But I wonder what route we are getting kettle from
2018-02-16T12:05:00 <the-t-in-rtf> gpii-launcher
2018-02-16T12:05:09 <the-t-in-rtf> almost positive on that one.
2018-02-16T12:05:31 <Bosmon> And where are we getting *that* from : P
2018-02-16T12:05:44 <the-t-in-rtf> there is a launcher for the instrumenter, so that you can run it as you would istanbul or nyc.
2018-02-16T12:06:13 <Bosmon> I mean, you\'re right, but I don\'t see it in gpii-testem\'s package.json
2018-02-16T12:06:29 <the-t-in-rtf> what does npm ls kettle say?
2018-02-16T12:06:49 <Bosmon> It does indeed say that gpii-launcher is a dependency of gpii-testem, and gives rise to kettle
2018-02-16T12:06:51 <Bosmon> But I can\'t see how
2018-02-16T12:07:05 <Bosmon> https://github.com/GPII/gpii-testem/blob/master/package.json
2018-02-16T12:07:10 <Bosmon> Perhaps the dependency went away recently?
2018-02-16T12:07:18 <the-t-in-rtf> No, the dev release was cut from a branch.
2018-02-16T12:07:24 <the-t-in-rtf> Specifically the one for which there is an open pull.

2018-02-16T12:07:50 <Bosmon> It seems to be assigned to me for review :)
2018-02-16T12:07:59 <the-t-in-rtf> Yes.
2018-02-16T12:08:21 <Bosmon> But I notice that the branch itself contains no updates to package.json
2018-02-16T12:08:49 <the-t-in-rtf> perhaps we combined reviews, just a moment.
2018-02-16T12:11:39 <the-t-in-rtf> Looks like it\'s in GPII-2736: https://github.com/the-t-in-rtf/gpii-testem/blob/GPII-2736/package.json#L31
2018-02-16T12:11:46 <the-t-in-rtf> I will make sure that is merged with the open review.
2018-02-16T12:11:58 <Bosmon> secret branch!!
2018-02-16T12:12:12 <the-t-in-rtf> Well, there is a ticket for it.
2018-02-16T12:12:26 <Bosmon> Well, sure
2018-02-16T12:12:30 <the-t-in-rtf> I thought I would have to go deeper down the rabbit hole to resolve the universal issues, and had done some early work there.
2018-02-16T12:12:36 <Bosmon> But without a pull I would never have discovered where this dev release was built from
2018-02-16T12:12:46 <the-t-in-rtf> Yes, that\'s not great, I will clean it up shortly.
2018-02-16T12:12:47 <Bosmon> Or without your knowhow :)
2018-02-16T12:13:05 <the-t-in-rtf> Perhaps we can have fluid-publish add some kind of metadata?
2018-02-16T12:13:16 <the-t-in-rtf> I mean, git knows what branch it\'s in at the time of cutting the release.
2018-02-16T12:13:28 <Bosmon> Well yes, but the metadata wouldn\'t be very reliable
2018-02-16T12:13:35 <Bosmon> There need be no correspondence between local and remote branch names
2018-02-16T12:13:43 <the-t-in-rtf> Hmm.  right.
2018-02-16T12:13:55 <Bosmon> I often rename people\'s remote branches if they seem to have funny names...
