2018-10-17T19:49:31 <jhernandez> Bosmon, stegru, cindyli: FYI, testing an installer with everything together and, while playing around, got an error and the log is telling the following https://pastebin.com/gvrJQ7Qe
2018-10-17T19:49:50 <jhernandez> that looks horrible
2018-10-17T19:50:30 <Bosmon> Astonishing and horrible
2018-10-17T19:50:34 <Bosmon> Definitely one for stegru :)
2018-10-17T19:51:06 <Bosmon> Is this with ffi-napi or did we back out to the forked ffi?
2018-10-17T19:53:01 <jhernandez> this one is using the official ffi, since we\'re still in electron 1.8
2018-10-17T19:53:12 <jhernandez> neither napi nor forked ffi involved
2018-10-17T19:55:05 <jhernandez> amazingly, I continued playing around and it behaves "normal"
2018-10-17T19:55:15 <jhernandez> trying to reproduce the problem again
2018-10-17T19:56:41 * danayo_ joined the channel
2018-10-17T19:59:16 <stegru> that doesn\'t look nice
2018-10-17T20:02:25 <jhernandez> ok, looks like it\'s happening when issuing a reset
2018-10-17T20:02:32 <jhernandez> hmmm
2018-10-17T20:02:45 <jhernandez> I can share the installer with you
2018-10-17T20:03:39 <jhernandez> and also, push my branch for you to build locally
2018-10-17T20:04:32 <stegru> hst removal looks ok, javi
2018-10-17T20:04:54 <jhernandez> stegru: yeah, I used it in my current build and it\'s fine
2018-10-17T20:05:03 <jhernandez> uploading the installer now
2018-10-17T20:05:08 <stegru> ok
2018-10-17T20:05:44 <stegru> the error is in the process reporter.. but I think that\'s just a symptom of something else
2018-10-17T20:05:55 <stegru> error/failure
2018-10-17T20:06:50 <jhernandez> okay, in fact you can use gpii-app/ajc3 to reproduce the issue
2018-10-17T20:08:15 <jhernandez> the only difference with my local branch  is the hst removal and the change to use the production cluster
2018-10-17T20:15:04 <jhernandez> I have leave now
2018-10-17T20:16:04 <jhernandez> later I\'ll try to reproduce the issue from the source code
2018-10-17T20:17:04 <jhernandez> Bosmon, stegru: I\'ve shared the installer with you
2018-10-17T20:18:05 <stegru> i\'ll sort it out in the morning
2018-10-17T20:18:11 <jhernandez> stegru: thanks for merging the hst-tools one
2018-10-17T20:19:01 <jhernandez> cool
2018-10-17T20:19:03 <jhernandez> and thanks
2018-10-17T20:19:09 <jhernandez> cheers!

2018-10-17T16:56:14 <Bosmon> Hi there simonjb - we haven\'t caught up for a while :)
2018-10-17T16:56:14 <Bosmon> I\'ve been seeing a lot of "cities" stuff going by
2018-10-17T16:56:14 <Bosmon> It\'s looking very interesting
2018-10-17T16:57:02 <Bosmon> I was wondering if you might have time to look over a smallish Kettle pull - https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/pull/49/files
2018-10-17T16:57:24 <Bosmon> No worries if you are a bit pressed, I\'m sure I can run it by someone else
2018-10-17T17:00:16 <simonjb> hi Bosmon, it has been a while! I was unfortunately quite sick in September and missed a bunch of work
2018-10-17T17:00:28 <Bosmon> Sorry to hear that
2018-10-17T17:00:52 <simonjb> I really enjoyed the community meeting and PPIG
2018-10-17T17:01:09 <simonjb> what a great event you organised
2018-10-17T17:02:01 <simonjb> Bosmon: the cities project has been really interesting; Toronto is in a very interesting position with regards to Sidewalk Labs
2018-10-17T17:02:24 <Bosmon> It\'s great you\'ve been able to keep the conversation going
2018-10-17T17:02:33 <simonjb> and yes, I can make time to review the kettle PR
2018-10-17T17:04:03 <Bosmon> See also pm :)
2018-10-17T17:04:20 <Bosmon> Thanks so much
2018-10-17T17:04:56 <simonjb> Bosmon: pm?
2018-10-17T17:05:02 <Bosmon> private message
2018-10-17T17:05:26 <Bosmon> Ah
2018-10-17T17:05:29 <Bosmon> Maybe it doesn\'t work
2018-10-17T17:05:34 <simonjb> on IRC?
2018-10-17T17:05:44 <simonjb> I didn\'t see anything :(
2018-10-17T17:12:20 <jhernandez> cindyli: btw, didn\'t mention, but your last changes from yesterday worked great :) thanks!!
2018-10-17T17:13:31 * jhung joined the channel
2018-10-17T17:14:28 <cindyli> yay! thanks for finding the problem and testing the fix, jhernandez
2018-10-17T17:15:44 <jhernandez> btw, I was going to add the bits to copy (or rename) the defaultSettings.json file
2018-10-17T17:15:45 * michelled joined the channel
2018-10-17T17:16:27 <jhernandez> I think of many different ways to achieve this but can\'t tell which one is the best
2018-10-17T17:19:10 <jhernandez> from the many options, I think that we can either a) include the defaultSettings.json file in gpii-wix-installer, or b) rename/copy the file from the gpii-app\'s npm postInstall script
2018-10-17T17:20:12 <jhernandez> at this moment I can do it manually, but we should think about how we want to ship it
2018-10-17T17:21:08 <jhernandez> not sure if this "standard configuration" fits into gpii-app\'s siteconfig though
2018-10-17T17:21:09 <jhernandez> Bosmon, cindyli: ^
2018-10-17T17:22:38 <Bosmon> jhernandez - where would b) cpy it to?
2018-10-17T17:22:40 <Bosmon> copy
2018-10-17T17:23:23 <jhernandez> I\'d say to gpii-universal/testData/snapshots
2018-10-17T17:23:34 <Bosmon> Oh I see
2018-10-17T17:23:49 <Bosmon> I think cindyli supported a more public location for it
2018-10-17T17:24:17 <jhernandez> yup, and this is actually being done internally
2018-10-17T17:24:59 <jhernandez> it\'s enough by just renaming the defaultSettings.win32.json as defaultSettings.json
2018-10-17T17:25:48 <jhernandez> Bosmon: this is described at https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/documentation/ResetComputer.md

2018-10-17T17:54:32 <simonjb> hi Justin_o, I\'m looking at your PR for FLUID-6298; it\'s been a while since I worked on Infusion and I\'m seeing and error that I don\'t understand in FF Console
2018-10-17T17:54:52 <Justin_o> simonjb: thanks for having a look.. what error are you seeing?
2018-10-17T17:55:25 <simonjb> when I load the prefsFramework demo locally, I see an error parsing "http://127.0.0.1:8080/demos/prefsFramework/messages/simplify_en.json" but don\'t see this error at https://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/prefsFramework/
2018-10-17T17:55:34 <simonjb> I\'m likely missing a build step?
2018-10-17T17:57:35 <simonjb> what I\'ve done: npm install, grunt, grunt buildStylus, then server root of project
2018-10-17T17:57:49 <simonjb> are those the right steps? any not necessary, or missing others?
2018-10-17T17:58:16 <Justin_o> simonjb: that should be enough, actually you should get that error in both spots. it\'s because the simplify doesn\'t have localized versions, so it falls back to simplify.json
2018-10-17T17:58:56 <Justin_o> simonjb: i just checked the build step and am getting the 404 for simplify_en.json
2018-10-17T17:59:07 <Justin_o> perhaps there is something caching for the build site for you?
2018-10-17T18:00:05 <simonjb> it\'s interesting, for me in FF, I see the 404 on the Network tab, but no error in Console tab (for build site)
2018-10-17T18:00:24 <Justin_o> ah i was looking in chrome.. let me check firefox
2018-10-17T18:01:14 <simonjb> but locally I see both 404 in Network and error in Console
2018-10-17T18:01:24 <simonjb> in Firefox also
2018-10-17T18:01:43 * sepidehshahi_ joined the channel
2018-10-17T18:01:45 <Justin_o> hmm.. interestingly i don\'t get it on either in the console for FF for me
2018-10-17T18:01:47 <Justin_o> simonjb: ^
2018-10-17T18:01:55 <Justin_o> simonjb: do you think it could be related to the server?
2018-10-17T18:02:37 <Justin_o> I believe I\'m using nginx through docker
2018-10-17T18:02:40 <simonjb> yes, definitely could be, though surely a 404 is a 404?
2018-10-17T18:02:50 <Justin_o> maybe something with the headers?
2018-10-17T18:02:58 <simonjb> yes, that\'s possible
2018-10-17T18:05:26 <simonjb> ok, the 404 responses differ -- nginx returns a 404 HTML page (build site), whereas the server I\'m using locally (the nodejs http-server) returns an empty response
