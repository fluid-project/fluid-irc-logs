2018-02-09T15:08:58 <mrtyler> fire away
2018-02-09T15:09:14 <mrtyler> or we can vidyo if you prefer
2018-02-09T15:09:31 <cindyli> 1. i ran https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/GPII-2630/scripts/vagrantCloudBasedContainers.sh in the universal vm to build and start the flow manager. then did "vagrant halt" to stop the vm. when I "vagrant up" again, is the flow manager still running or i need to "docker start" it?
