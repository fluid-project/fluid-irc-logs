2018-06-18T09:36:11 <the-t-in-rtf> @amatas[m], I just noticed the "init" option in the Vagrant CI Plugin.
2018-06-18T09:36:15 <the-t-in-rtf> What does it do?
2018-06-18T09:42:05 <amatas[m]> hi the-t-in-rtf where did you see that option?
2018-06-18T09:55:32 <the-t-in-rtf> duhrer-macbook:gpii-handlebars duhrer$ vagrant ci foobar
2018-06-18T09:55:32 <the-t-in-rtf> Usage: vagrant ci [<args>]
2018-06-18T09:55:32 <the-t-in-rtf> Available subcommands:
2018-06-18T09:55:32 <the-t-in-rtf> init
2018-06-18T09:55:33 <the-t-in-rtf> test
2018-06-18T09:55:34 <the-t-in-rtf> For help on any individual command run `vagrant ci <command> -h`
2018-06-18T09:55:51 <the-t-in-rtf> duhrer-macbook:gpii-handlebars duhrer$ vagrant ci init -h
2018-06-18T09:55:51 <the-t-in-rtf> Usage: vagrant ci test [-h]
2018-06-18T09:55:51 <the-t-in-rtf> -h, --help                       Print this help
2018-06-18T09:56:07 <the-t-in-rtf> the test subcommand has help.
2018-06-18T09:56:52 <the-t-in-rtf> the init command doesn\'t.
2018-06-18T09:57:18 <the-t-in-rtf> I only noticed it because my jetlagged brain and fingers typoed the test command... ;)
2018-06-18T09:57:39 <the-t-in-rtf> but we\'ve talked about a separate provisioning command before, so I thought I\'d ask.
2018-06-18T10:19:21 <amatas[m]> Oh now I can remember, the init command does nothing now
2018-06-18T10:20:28 <amatas[m]> that command was meant to be something similar to the "vagrant init" command, which creates a Vagrant template file, but creating a vagrant.yml instead.

2018-06-18T12:07:23 <the-t-in-rtf> Thanks.
2018-06-18T12:07:39 <the-t-in-rtf> So, @amatas[m], seems like the problem with h-0005 is back: https://gitlab.com/GPII/gpii-handlebars/-/jobs/74988007
2018-06-18T12:08:41 <the-t-in-rtf> I haven\'t managed to get a successful build yet this morning, that\'s the fourth attempt.  Three were failures specific to provisioning.
2018-06-18T12:21:32 <amatas[m]> the-t-in-rtf: https://gitlab.com/GPII/gpii-handlebars/-/jobs/75565635
2018-06-18T12:22:00 <amatas[m]> I\'ve added the "DISPLAY" environment variable in the CI project setup
2018-06-18T12:23:09 <amatas[m]> https://gitlab.com/GPII/gpii-handlebars/pipelines/23873035
2018-06-18T12:23:15 <amatas[m]> I\'ve triggered a new build
2018-06-18T12:23:47 <the-t-in-rtf> Ah, right.  Just to confirm, if  I wanted to set that in the Gitlab CI to future-proof it, I\'d need to set it for all stages that use vagrant?
2018-06-18T12:24:31 <the-t-in-rtf> Well, I guess not for destroy, but for "up" and "ci test", right?
2018-06-18T12:25:00 <amatas[m]> it seems that only the stage that does "vagrant up" is affected by the setting of that variable
2018-06-18T12:26:28 <amatas[m]> only for the "up", the issue happens when it tries to create a window but it doesn\'t know where
2018-06-18T12:28:06 <the-t-in-rtf> I think it\'s a good idea to put it before vagrant ci tests as well.
2018-06-18T12:28:18 <the-t-in-rtf> The first build today failed only on webdriver tests, which to me seems suspicious.
2018-06-18T12:28:19 <the-t-in-rtf> https://gitlab.com/GPII/gpii-handlebars/-/jobs/75514278
2018-06-18T12:28:59 <the-t-in-rtf> I\'ll test that once the manual build finishes.
2018-06-18T12:36:56 <amatas[m]> https://gitlab.com/GPII/gpii-handlebars/pipelines/23873035
2018-06-18T12:37:13 <amatas[m]> the tests of the manual build passed
