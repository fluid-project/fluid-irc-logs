2018-10-29T14:28:17 <the-t-in-rtf> @Bosmon, it\'s been a while, any reason not to use the "prioritised pseudo-events as promise chain" pattern now?
2018-10-29T14:33:52 <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/GPII/gpii-testem/blob/master/src/js/testem-component.js#L37
2018-10-29T14:34:00 <the-t-in-rtf> Like I did there.
2018-10-29T14:35:41 <the-t-in-rtf> The docs still say that the function is part of an API, but I thought I\'d ask in case there\'s a better/newer way to chain events in sequence.
2018-10-29T14:35:50 <the-t-in-rtf> I\'
2018-10-29T14:36:11 <the-t-in-rtf> I\'m using it for the lifecycle of the docker based gpii-pouchdb test harness.
2018-10-29T14:37:03 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - yes, it should be used wherever possible
2018-10-29T14:37:28 <the-t-in-rtf> great, thanks.
2018-10-29T14:37:35 <Bosmon> It\'s the most faithful incarnation that we currently have of our future "method combination" system which will replace and/or amalgamate events and invokers
