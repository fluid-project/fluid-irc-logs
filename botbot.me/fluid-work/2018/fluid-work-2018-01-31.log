b'2018-01-31T20:52:05 <gtirloni> but our path up until github\'s ISP is totally fine
2018-01-31T20:52:32 <simonjb> gtirloni: you could also use https://github.com/GPII/universal/commit/8f84cf12d40ce0a29e94e88ba9db4840e616b3d4
2018-01-31T20:52:39 <gtirloni> i\'ll keep trying to clone the repo and then run some tests... let\'s see how that goes
2018-01-31T20:52:40 <gtirloni> simonjb: will do
2018-01-31T20:52:51 <simonjb> that\'s my merge point
2018-01-31T20:52:59 <ussjoin> gtirloni: Ka wow at that packet loss. Go outside and look for a backhoe with a bad attitude?
2018-01-31T20:53:30 <simonjb> thanks gtirloni !
2018-01-31T20:54:10 <gtirloni> ussjoin: haha! that\'s very likely, the packet loss does starts at cogentco\'s PoP in toronto
2018-01-31T20:54:37 <gtirloni> cindyli simonjb: please look outside your windows for any suspicious activities, as suggested by ussjoin :)
2018-01-31T20:55:31 <gtirloni> i think i\'ll invoke OCAD IT\'s powers anyway.. regardless if it\'s the root cause for the gpii/windows issue
2018-01-31T20:56:29 <ussjoin> gtirloni: Oh it\'s Cogent? I was just yesterday hearing rants from my ISP friends about suckitude in the northeast US from Cogent. (Two are deeply senior neckbeards for Spectrum, two run their own ISPs. I have odd friends.) So it may not just be you.
2018-01-31T20:59:00 <gtirloni> ah, that\'s great information, thanks
2018-01-31T21:03:12 <ussjoin> gtirloni: From one of the ISP-runners: "cogent sometimes has the best performing backbone and other times the worst.  Very day/time dependent. Points to lots of [over-]subscription and not much headroom. Many operators use a cogent just to get to cogent customers \xe2\x80\x94 don\xe2\x80\x99t try to use it for actual transit."
2018-01-31T21:04:25 <gtirloni> oh, we\'re definitely using it for transit.. and I can confirm that report. I\'ve had to report issues to IT where we were getting 5MB/s downloads for hours and hours and then suddenly it\'s at 400MB/s again
2018-01-31T21:06:26 <ussjoin> *nods*
2018-01-31T21:06:59 <ussjoin> He says he got some of his customers to break multi-year Cogent contracts *for performance*. I realize you can\'t do that on behalf of OCAD, but it\'s a heck of a datapoint.

2018-01-31T21:11:36 <gtirloni> yeah, we can build a case. prometheus will come in handy... I think we have good leverage with OCAD, if we show these issues and they correlate with "crazy" stuff they are seeing people complain about, it might work... thanks for the info again, super valuable

2018-01-31T11:21:09 <georgitodorov> Please take a look at it when you have the time and let us know if you have any questions, comments or suggestions.
2018-01-31T11:21:26 <georgitodorov> Also, we prepared a PoC of an Infusion-only solution for the survey functionality. It is available in this branch: https://github.com/danailbd/gpii-app/tree/GPII-2732-revised
2018-01-31T11:21:45 <georgitodorov> Let us know if you would like us to take you through the code on a Skype call or if you want to review it by yourself and then have a quick meeting. Thank you!

2018-01-31T17:10:53 <ussjoin> Not yet, amatas_, can I look at it today or do you need to just go?
2018-01-31T17:11:58 <amatas_> np, I only want you to know how I changed the way to manage the secrets in our deployment using the kubernetes secrets type.
2018-01-31T17:12:19 <ussjoin> Away from GitLab variables, yes?
2018-01-31T17:12:55 <amatas_> no, the gitlab variables are still needed until we integrate it with Vault
2018-01-31T17:13:08 <amatas_> but I'm working on this last item

2018-01-31T20:46:36 <simonjb> gtirloni: it's possible that she deleted the branch as it's now merged into master
2018-01-31T20:46:53 <simonjb> so you can get the same code at GPII/universal master
2018-01-31T20:46:57 <gtirloni> so the tests you conducted with gpii/universal's master already had her changes?
2018-01-31T20:47:35 <simonjb> no, I tested before the merge (if I understand)
2018-01-31T20:47:50 <gtirloni> ok, I'm not sure what to test
2018-01-31T20:48:13 <simonjb> master is now equivalent to her GPII-2662 of Monday
2018-01-31T20:48:26 <simonjb> so, I think it makes sense to test master
2018-01-31T20:48:35 <gtirloni> ok, i'll check that
2018-01-31T20:48:41 <simonjb> and thanks very much for looking at it gtirloni !
2018-01-31T20:48:49 <gtirloni> github is cloning windows' repo at 56KiB/s right now :|
2018-01-31T20:49:03 <gtirloni> i wonder if that's related somehow (cloning from idrc's datacenter)

2018-01-31T20:50:32 <cindyli> gtirloni: i did delete it
2018-01-31T20:51:07 <cindyli> gtirloni: but it should be equivalent to the current master
2018-01-31T20:51:13 <gtirloni> ok
2018-01-31T20:51:24 <simonjb> gtirloni: my merge of GPII-2662 is the latest commit on master
2018-01-31T20:51:25 <simonjb> https://github.com/GPII/universal/commits/master
2018-01-31T20:51:25 <gtirloni> glad you're not a branch hoarder though
2018-01-31T20:51:28 <gtirloni> :)
2018-01-31T20:51:38 <cindyli> not at all :)
2018-01-31T20:51:41 <gtirloni> packet loss to github from the idrc datacenter is at 25% right now
