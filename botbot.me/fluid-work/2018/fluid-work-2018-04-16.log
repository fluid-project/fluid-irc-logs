2018-04-16T09:57:05 <georgitodorov> the-t-in-rtf: Hey, Tony! Did the approach we discussed on Friday about copying only the gpii-universal module work?
2018-04-16T09:58:01 <the-t-in-rtf> Hi, @georgitodorov.  Haven't got it working yet, which is just as well, as I saw your other comments on GitHub about additional material.
2018-04-16T09:58:18 <the-t-in-rtf> I'm working on an important task for the UL, but plan to look at it further later today.
2018-04-16T09:58:51 <the-t-in-rtf> My idea is to look for all includes of node_modules content in HTML test fixtures and make sure I copy all of them to the instrumented subdir.
2018-04-16T09:59:52 <georgitodorov> the-t-in-rtf: This sounds good. However, for the PSP you should examine all HTML files in the renderer folder. Not only the test fixtures.
2018-04-16T10:00:23 <the-t-in-rtf> Good tip, thanks.
