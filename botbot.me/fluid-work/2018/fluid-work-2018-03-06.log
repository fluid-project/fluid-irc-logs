2018-03-06T19:00:08 <georgit> Bosmon: What\'s Vidyo then? :)
2018-03-06T19:00:21 <the-t-in-rtf> Videoconferencing software that the IDRC provides.
2018-03-06T19:00:24 <Bosmon> hahaha
2018-03-06T19:00:34 <Bosmon> I\'ll call everyone up on Skype, if that works
2018-03-06T19:00:39 <the-t-in-rtf> It\'s good in particular if we want to connect to one of their rooms.
2018-03-06T19:00:42 <Bosmon> I forget who we had invited
2018-03-06T19:00:45 <the-t-in-rtf> Probably good to get it before the offsite.

2018-03-06T19:04:15 <Bosmon> I am dialling
2018-03-06T19:04:17 <Bosmon> Very shortly
2018-03-06T19:04:26 <the-t-in-rtf> Also, I had a question about staring into the abyss.

2018-03-06T19:04:36 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, thanks.
2018-03-06T19:05:05 <ussjoin_> the-t-in-rtf: Have you read Normal?
2018-03-06T19:08:13 <the-t-in-rtf> no, but I\'ve read a little Transmetropolitan.
2018-03-06T19:08:17 <the-t-in-rtf> I\'ll have to put it on my list.
2018-03-06T19:10:51 <ussjoin_> Is very short, FWIW (all four parts combined are essentially a shortish novella), but deals entirely with the staring into the abyss thing. (Also it\'s prose, not a graphic novel, FWIW.)

2018-03-06T19:59:26 <mrtyler> > CI does pass on master because the production config tests that runs after never use the container built from this shell script
2018-03-06T19:59:34 <mrtyler> welp
2018-03-06T19:59:40 <cindyli> that\'s a wrong statement
2018-03-06T19:59:41 <cindyli> :)
2018-03-06T19:59:48 <mrtyler> i quoted you, friend :)

2018-03-06T20:00:02 <cindyli> thanks guys
2018-03-06T20:00:18 * scott_gonzalez has quit
2018-03-06T20:00:33 <mrtyler> ok so i don\'t understand again
2018-03-06T20:00:50 <mrtyler> if it works in CI using the container, why are we having this crazy couchdb _users database doesn\'t exist problem?
2018-03-06T20:00:58 <mrtyler> is that related to your work after all?
2018-03-06T20:02:33 <cindyli> mrtyler: i think i figured out why. in the master, the preferences server access couchdb data using record ids. the url looks like: http://localhost:5984/gpii/carla
2018-03-06T20:02:53 <cindyli> couchdb knows how to fetch this one single record
2018-03-06T20:03:13 <cindyli> with the changes in GPII-2630, the flow manager now accesses data based on couchdb views
2018-03-06T20:03:25 <cindyli> the url looks like: http://localhost:5984/gpii/_design/views/_view/findPrefsSafeByGpiiKey?key=%22carla%22&include_docs=true
2018-03-06T20:03:35 <mrtyler> ah
2018-03-06T20:03:47 <cindyli> with using views, an index needs to be first built for each view, this will take time
2018-03-06T20:04:08 <mrtyler> can we force the index to be built, and have it ready faster?
2018-03-06T20:04:11 <cindyli> so the first request on the same view will be much slower than following requests
2018-03-06T20:05:06 <cindyli> yes, that\'s why i added a line in the shell script to wget the view url to force the index to build before the line that runs tests
2018-03-06T20:05:34 <cindyli> however, when the view url will return 500 when the index is not ready
2018-03-06T20:05:47 <cindyli> and wget would stop retries by seeing 500
2018-03-06T20:06:14 <cindyli> so, unfortunately i have to swap wget back to curl again
2018-03-06T20:06:19 <cindyli> to force the retry to happen
2018-03-06T20:06:40 <mrtyler> > wget would stop retries by seeing 500
2018-03-06T20:06:54 <mrtyler> really? that sounds pretty dumb. is there a different command-line flag you can set or something?
2018-03-06T20:07:18 <mrtyler> anyway i think the strategy remains sound
2018-03-06T20:07:32 <mrtyler> can\'t talk to couchdb until it\'s ready to talk to you.
2018-03-06T20:07:47 <cindyli> i googled but no luck with finding solutions for forcing the retry at 500 with wget
2018-03-06T20:07:56 <mrtyler> it sounds like you\'ve at least figured out *why* it was failing, so that\'s something
2018-03-06T20:08:22 <cindyli> and the problem has been fixed in the shell script. now the production config tests pass
2018-03-06T20:08:41 <mrtyler> by switching back to curl?
2018-03-06T20:08:43 <cindyli> i\'m pushing up the change soon, just updating readme at the moment
2018-03-06T20:08:46 <cindyli> yes
2018-03-06T20:08:49 <mrtyler> neat
2018-03-06T20:08:51 <cindyli> you guys should review the change
2018-03-06T20:08:52 <mrtyler> well good job :)
2018-03-06T20:09:21 <mrtyler> wget sucks anyway. long live curl! :p
2018-03-06T20:10:09 <cindyli> haha, Bosmon said something similar here earlier
2018-03-06T20:11:42 * georgit has quit
2018-03-06T20:12:00 <mrtyler> yes i was channeling him
2018-03-06T20:12:07 <mrtyler> you couldn\'t hear it, but i did it in my poshest british accent
2018-03-06T20:12:23 <mrtyler> cindyli: fyi i just saw this: Starting with version 1.19.1, Wget supports the option --retry-on-http-error which you can use to specify a list of HTTP error codes that should be retried. So, provided that you are running a current version of wget, just add this to the arguments: --retry-on-http-error=503
2018-03-06T20:12:46 <mrtyler> there must be some fascinating history that explains why wget and curl are both so obtuse about retries on certain kinds of failures
2018-03-06T20:12:58 <mrtyler> why not just retry, like i told you to do, you uppity binary!
2018-03-06T20:13:31 <cindyli> thanks, mrtyler, trying --retry-on-http-error
2018-03-06T20:13:49 <mrtyler> curl is a perfectly fine solution, if that works for everything
2018-03-06T20:14:21 <cindyli> cool
2018-03-06T20:15:13 * qquuiinn joined the channel
2018-03-06T20:16:45 <gtirloni> curl is caught up in discussions about what\'s a "transient" error and how, in their opinion, it\'s useless to retry after "permanent" errors. i think that\'s why cindy/alfredo had to switch to wget (which is the proposed change in GPII-2885)

2018-03-06T20:21:21 <mrtyler> thanks was just about to ask for a diff
2018-03-06T20:21:29 <mrtyler> cindyli: can we use either curl or wget but not both?
2018-03-06T20:21:51 <cindyli> what do you mean "both"

2018-03-06T20:22:32 * Smirnoff joined the channel
2018-03-06T20:22:34 <colinclark> I think he means lines 60 and 66, cindyli
2018-03-06T20:22:52 <colinclark> on the former, you use curl, on the latter, you use wget
2018-03-06T20:23:03 <mrtyler> yup, that\'s what i meant :)
2018-03-06T20:23:08 <cindyli> i haven\'t tried --retry-on-http-error on line 60, so it\'s possible
2018-03-06T20:23:18 <cindyli> to switch to wget if that option works
2018-03-06T20:23:44 <cindyli> i did have an issue with using curl on line 66, trying to rmb
2018-03-06T20:24:04 * rhitik has quit
2018-03-06T20:24:55 <mrtyler> if you have to use both tools, i\'d recommend some comments explaining why both curl and wget are in use
2018-03-06T20:25:00 <mrtyler> otherwise, lgtm :)
2018-03-06T20:25:11 <cindyli> ok, i rmb. i received that famous "connection error" problem which alfredo sent an pull request to fix
2018-03-06T20:25:26 <cindyli> good idea, mrtyler
2018-03-06T20:25:50 <cindyli> let me try --retry-on-http-error first
2018-03-06T20:25:55 <mrtyler> even if you get it down to one tool, it may be worth a comment explaining all this complexity around retrying "fatal" vs "non-fatal" errors
2018-03-06T20:25:56 <cindyli> for line 60
2018-03-06T20:26:02 <cindyli> agree
2018-03-06T20:26:05 <mrtyler> which, as a long-time user of both wget and curl, i still find quite distressing :)
2018-03-06T20:26:13 * Smirnoffq has quit
2018-03-06T20:27:30 <cindyli> as a short time user of both, it costs me half day to fit them to different scenarios ;)

2018-03-06T16:19:53 <cindyli> pranaljn97: because you are using a higher version of mysql
2018-03-06T16:20:35 <cindyli> this shows that upgrading mysql is part of the AChecker upgrade.
2018-03-06T16:22:04 <pranaljn97> cindyli: can\'t we fix this by CURRENT_TIMESTAMP value or any valid default value ?
2018-03-06T16:26:05 * qquuiinn joined the channel
2018-03-06T16:27:06 <cindyli> pranaljn97: NULL makes more sense than CURRENT_TIMESTAMP in this case
2018-03-06T16:28:12 <cindyli> there are a number of other datetime fields in table structures. what the default value should be depends on what each filed is designed for

2018-03-06T16:34:00 <pranaljn97> cindyli: I agree. But we should first change the table structure for these two tables which are creating error in installation.

2018-03-06T16:50:50 <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: The template for the GSoC project applications is at the bottom of our organization page https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/6584170814373888/

2018-03-06T16:51:24 <cindyli> the problem I noticed is, after the data is loaded into the CouchDB, the view doesn\'t become accessible immediately
2018-03-06T16:51:53 <cindyli> but if you wait long enough time and after a few more tries on wget or curl, views will become accessible
2018-03-06T16:52:18 <cindyli> i wonder if there are better ways to handle this kind of wait, mrtyler?

2018-03-06T17:11:20 <mrtyler> not sure i understand
2018-03-06T17:11:33 <mrtyler> if couchdb isn\'t ready to serve data, it\'s not ready to serve data. not sure what else we would do?
2018-03-06T17:11:51 <mrtyler> if couchdb isn\'t ready to serve data, preferences server isn\'t ready to serve data
2018-03-06T17:12:02 <mrtyler> seems like waiting for the system to be ready is desirable and unavoidable
2018-03-06T17:12:07 <mrtyler> am i misunderstanding the problem / question?
2018-03-06T17:12:23 <cindyli> you understand correctly, mrtyler
2018-03-06T17:13:08 <mrtyler> if couchdb is taking a long time to be able to serve data, that might be worth investigating
2018-03-06T17:14:10 <mrtyler> fwiw, gpii-infra does basically the same wait as you\'re doing here
2018-03-06T17:14:20 <mrtyler> and i\'ve never seen it take more than a minute or so to converge, afair
2018-03-06T17:14:43 <mrtyler> do couchdb logs reveal anything bad happening during startup?
2018-03-06T17:16:30 <simonjb> hi michelled and colinclark, when would it work for you to chat about Nexus and P4A?
2018-03-06T17:17:04 <michelled> I\'m available other than 1-2
2018-03-06T17:17:06 <colinclark> 3 pm, simonjb?
2018-03-06T17:17:24 <colinclark> too late?
2018-03-06T17:17:25 <simonjb> michelled, colinclark: 3pm is good for me, thanks!
2018-03-06T17:17:30 <michelled> great!

2018-03-06T17:18:56 <cindyli> mrtyler: repeated error messages like - https://pastebin.com/nezA0p7P
2018-03-06T17:19:20 <cindyli> i\'m going to rerun the shell script to find out if errors were reported during the data loading or at wget
2018-03-06T17:19:57 <mrtyler> idk a ton about couchdb but that looks like expected error messages when trying to hit a db that doesn\'t exist
2018-03-06T17:20:02 <mrtyler> i.e. expected during startup
2018-03-06T17:20:26 <mrtyler> i think re-run and watch logs is a good next step
2018-03-06T17:21:02 <amatas> cindyli, mrtyler: it seems that some system databases are missing
2018-03-06T17:21:31 <amatas> http://docs.couchdb.org/en/2.0.0/install/#single-node-setup
2018-03-06T17:22:16 <cindyli> amatas: do you mean I should access those system tables first to make sure couchdb is installed properly?
2018-03-06T17:22:21 <amatas> http://docs.couchdb.org/en/2.1.1/install/setup.html#install-setup
2018-03-06T17:22:59 <amatas> I think that adding the curl cmds should be enough to avoid those errors
2018-03-06T17:23:17 <amatas> curl -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:5984/_users
2018-03-06T17:23:19 <amatas> curl -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:5984/_replicator
2018-03-06T17:23:21 <amatas> curl -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:5984/_global_changes
2018-03-06T17:24:45 <mrtyler> why would those extra curls have suddenly become necessary?
2018-03-06T17:24:54 <mrtyler> how did this work before cindy\'s changes if they are required?
2018-03-06T17:25:04 <mrtyler> or did cindy\'s changes affect those tables somehow?
2018-03-06T17:26:07 <cindyli> amatas: mrtyler:
2018-03-06T17:26:09 <cindyli> [vagrant@universal universal]$ curl http://localhost:5984/_users
2018-03-06T17:26:09 <cindyli> {"error":"not_found","reason":"Database does not exist."}
2018-03-06T17:26:18 <amatas> I don\'t know if the Cindy\'s changes are related to those errors, but I remember that those errors raised when the above databases were missing

2018-03-06T17:28:29 <cindyli> amatas: do you remember how you fixed those errors?
2018-03-06T17:28:50 <amatas> creating the databases using the curl commands ;)
2018-03-06T17:29:00 <amatas> before any operation
2018-03-06T17:29:04 <Bosmon> curl: The UNNIVERSAL TECHNOLLOGY
2018-03-06T17:30:35 <cindyli> amatas: switching to the old version of this shell script to see if that reports errors
2018-03-06T17:30:42 <VictorNG_> @cindyli, Like I asked before, the accessibility checker on the local host(server),for both PHP 5.6 and PHP 7.0 do return \'No Problem Detected " in most html file, but in the online version achecker.ca,it will return a couple of errors for the same html file, I wanted to know if the problem is from the code ?
2018-03-06T17:31:29 <cindyli> VictorNG_: i don\'t know without tracing into the code
2018-03-06T17:31:58 * VictorN10 joined the channel
2018-03-06T17:32:01 <cindyli> but i suspect it might related to the version of simple html dom parser which doesn\'t support the higher version of php

2018-03-06T17:36:35 <VictorNG_> my expectations was that all libraries should be functional like the online site, since I was running it on an older version of php

2018-03-06T18:14:49 <cindyli> YAY! welcome onboard, sgithens. i\'m fine for now by assuming we\'ll keep those endpoints. always easier to remove them later. at then, will need the endpoint stuff from you again
2018-03-06T18:15:32 * colinclark joined the channel
2018-03-06T18:17:14 <sgithens> cindyli: awesome thanks!  At some point I do want to get back to the audit script though and add the extra lookup for the category of endpoints you said wasn\'t being included.
2018-03-06T18:17:45 <cindyli> mrtyler: CI does pass on master because the production config tests that runs after never use the container built from this shell script, it only needs http://preferences.gpii.net to be up and running
2018-03-06T18:18:14 <cindyli> flow manager and preference containers haven\'t really been in use in the master
2018-03-06T18:18:35 <cindyli> that would be great. thanks, sgithens

2018-03-06T18:32:32 <gtirloni> cindyli: the vagrantCloudBasedContainers.sh script spins up local prefs/flowmanager containers and points tests at them locally (https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/scripts/vagrantCloudBasedContainers.sh#L35  and  https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/package.json#L77)
2018-03-06T18:36:55 <cindyli> i see, it uses the prefs server docker container spinned up by this shell script, thanks, gtirloni

2018-03-06T09:49:57 <the-t-in-rtf> @Bosmon, seems like it might be unique to OS X, which is irritating but survivable for now.
2018-03-06T09:50:12 <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. they run fine in a Vagrant VM.
2018-03-06T09:51:28 <e-mangi> am asking because one of the communication venues of the community is wiki " https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Get+Involved "
2018-03-06T09:51:43 <e-mangi> but i can\'t find the wiki page

2018-03-06T10:37:22 <georgitodorov> And one more thing - the two electron issues are still open. The only thing that is fixed in 2.0.0 is the correct order of destroying a BrowserWindow with an embedded webview.
2018-03-06T10:55:18 <Bosmon> georgitodorov - thanks very much
2018-03-06T10:55:29 <Bosmon> georgitodorov - so we will have some remaining "object has been destroyed" failures?
2018-03-06T10:55:53 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: For the time being - yes
2018-03-06T10:56:26 <georgitodorov> What worries me more though is the issue with the dimensions of the BrowserWindow when the DPI is increased to 175%
2018-03-06T10:56:35 <Bosmon> georgitodorov - yes
2018-03-06T10:56:36 * amatas joined the channel
2018-03-06T10:56:42 <Bosmon> I think we have some kind of leak in the tests
2018-03-06T10:56:45 <georgitodorov> We tested locally at Astea and the layout of the PSP breaks
2018-03-06T10:56:56 <Bosmon> I\'ve noticed that when they conclude that the magnifier has been left running
2018-03-06T10:57:02 <Bosmon> Have you seen this?
2018-03-06T10:57:13 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: We investigated this, yes
2018-03-06T10:57:41 <georgitodorov> We unzipped the electron.asar archive to see where exactly the error occurred
2018-03-06T10:58:10 <georgitodorov> And it was when the webview was trying to send a `destroyed` ipc message to the hosting browser window
2018-03-06T10:58:27 <georgitodorov> But the browser window had been destroyed for some reason by that time
2018-03-06T10:58:43 <georgitodorov> Which is odd because the browser window hosts the webview
2018-03-06T10:59:27 <georgitodorov> It gets even more interesting - the only tests that do fail are those where the browser window is not closed
2018-03-06T10:59:43 <georgitodorov> I tried closing it programatically - and the tests continued to fail...
2018-03-06T11:00:10 <georgitodorov> We can discuss this further on our status call later today if you\'d like
2018-03-06T11:00:16 <Bosmon> georgitodorov - certainly
2018-03-06T11:00:52 <Bosmon> georgitodorov - and about the magnifier issue - did you happen to see which test is responsible for this?
2018-03-06T11:02:08 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: No, we haven\'t looked into this yet
2018-03-06T11:02:59 <georgitodorov> Usually when we run the tests locally, we comment out the require("gpii-universal") and require("gpii-windows")
2018-03-06T11:03:17 <georgitodorov> And the tests that come along with these two modules
2018-03-06T11:03:51 <georgitodorov> Also, we comment out the application of user settings but maybe this should not be done

2018-03-06T13:49:54 <jhernandez> Bosmon, georgitodorov: hey, I can\'t do the status meeting today. I\'m specially interested in the problems we\'re having with tests - the object was destroyed,  the magnifier remaining there, etc. I\'ll catch up with this by following your comments here and in the pull requests
2018-03-06T13:50:25 <Bosmon> jhernandez - cheers
2018-03-06T13:50:29 <Bosmon> Do you see the magnifier remaining as well?
2018-03-06T13:53:45 <Bosmon> Thanks for the fix, amatas, gtirloni!
