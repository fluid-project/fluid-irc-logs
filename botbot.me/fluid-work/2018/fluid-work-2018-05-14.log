2018-05-14T21:17:37 <mrtyler> it's interesting that the existence of this magic default seems to contradict the second answer, which claims this is not possible
2018-05-14T21:18:06 <mrtyler> fwiw i'm not sure you can rely on this feature in e.g. the CI environment. it looks like a great solution for ad-hoc testing though
2018-05-14T21:18:11 <mrtyler> glad you got it working :)

2018-05-14T09:56:24 <the-t-in-rtf> Morning.  Who\'s the best person to ask about CI configs these days?
2018-05-14T09:57:06 <the-t-in-rtf> Specifically about the CI config for gpii-app.
2018-05-14T09:57:44 <the-t-in-rtf> Eventually we\'ll need to retain reports and other artefacts for all builds, but in that project it would help me troubleshoot some problems that appear to be unique to CI if a few files were retained for each run.

2018-05-14T14:24:16 <Justin_o> It\'s basically the same as what is linked to from the wiki. Slight change to mention CLAassistant on GitHub and for formatting. I tried to make it look better, but it seems that GitHub strips a lot of things out of gists.
2018-05-14T14:24:40 <Justin_o> Also should I bump the version number and update the other CLAs as well for the CLAassistant on GitHub part?

2018-05-14T14:33:29 <colinclark> Is there any reason to retain fax as an option, Justin_o?
2018-05-14T14:34:09 <colinclark> Other than that question, I think it looks good
2018-05-14T14:35:26 <Justin_o> colinclark: i guess there needs to be a way to send it in for those that aren\'t using GitHub (e.g. design contributions) and doesn\'t require it to be sent by standard mail. Maybe instead of fax we mention e-mail? And if so, which address?
2018-05-14T14:37:01 <Justin_o> colinclark: or do you mean specifically for the gist because it\'s going to be used by CLAassistant and so we can omit fax because or that
2018-05-14T14:45:48 <colinclark> well, I guess either :)
2018-05-14T14:46:22 <colinclark> I wonder if there are any reasons why we couldn\'t have all contributions via CLA Assistant?
2018-05-14T14:46:57 <colinclark> it seems to me that finding a FAX machine and making a long distance call for most people is harder than acquiring a Github account, for example :)
2018-05-14T15:01:04 <Justin_o> colinclark: I don\'t remember the last time that I got one of these faxed in.
2018-05-14T15:01:24 <colinclark> I\'d say let\'s definitely remove it from the CLAA version of this
2018-05-14T15:01:56 <colinclark> email seems like a more feasible transport than FAX these days if someone really doesn\'t want a Github account for example
2018-05-14T15:03:14 <Justin_o> okay, and we\'ve been doing that with the document based ones as is.. i guess we can consider updating those later too, but for now i\'ll just swap in the CLAassistant mention for the fax one in the gist
2018-05-14T15:04:06 <Justin_o> colinclark: i\'ve updated the gist https://gist.github.com/jobara/b932eeb8bcb226583ead8b86a51b4099
2018-05-14T15:08:39 <cindyli> Bosmon, Justin_o: is there a limit on how many releases I can publish gpii-universal npm package? I published one half an hour ago and received the confirmation email from npm:
2018-05-14T15:08:41 <cindyli> A new version of the package gpii-universal (0.3.0-dev.20180514T142832Z.4dd77211.GPII-2630) was published at 2018-05-14T14:28:47.664Z from
2018-05-14T15:08:41 <cindyli> 67.216.44.39. The shasum of this package was a40c5d4c7775f90dac30331055d25fe04c830a9c.
2018-05-14T15:09:15 <cindyli> But the new version "0.3.0-dev.20180514T142832Z.4dd77211.GPII-2630" hasn\'t shown up on the versions page: https://www.npmjs.com/package/gpii-universal
2018-05-14T15:09:24 <Bosmon> cindyli - the versions page always lags
2018-05-14T15:09:33 <Bosmon> You can get a more authoritative view from "npm view"
2018-05-14T15:10:28 <cindyli> Bosmon: i also tried with pulling this version in a windows vm but getting nomatching error
2018-05-14T15:10:34 <cindyli> No matching version found for gpii-universal@0.3.0-dev.20180514T142832Z.4dd77211.GPII-2630
2018-05-14T15:11:07 <Bosmon> cindyli - I see it
2018-05-14T15:11:08 <Justin_o> cindyli: run "npm view gpii-universal versions" in your terminal
2018-05-14T15:11:13 <Justin_o> i see it listed there
2018-05-14T15:12:20 <cindyli> i can see it too
2018-05-14T15:12:20 <colinclark> Sounds good to me, Justin_o
2018-05-14T15:12:24 <colinclark> and this looks good, thanks!
2018-05-14T15:12:29 <Justin_o> colinclark: thanks :)
2018-05-14T15:13:41 <cindyli> seems a lagging issue. windows vm can now reach it. thanks guys

2018-05-14T18:51:51 <cindyli> i normally start GPII in windows vm using "node gpii.js"
2018-05-14T18:52:19 <cindyli> tried with the command: NODE_ENV=gpii.config.cloudBased.development.all.local node gpii.js
2018-05-14T18:52:22 <cindyli> but didn\'t work

2018-05-14T18:56:19 <cindyli> stegru: you mean the different config name? i did
2018-05-14T18:56:23 <cindyli> getting this error:

2018-05-14T18:57:29 <cindyli> i\'m going to modify node_modules/gpii-universal/index.js
2018-05-14T18:57:45 <stegru> i mean, like: node gpii.js gpii.config...
2018-05-14T18:57:59 <cindyli> oh, trying...
2018-05-14T18:59:06 <cindyli> stegru: doesn\'t work, seems like a path issue - Could not find a config file at any of the paths V:\\gpii.config.cloudBased.development.all.local\\gpii.config.development.all.local, V:\\gpii.config.cloudBased.development.all.local\\gpii.config.development.all.local.json, V:\\gpii.config.cloudBased.development.all.local\\gpii.config.development.all.local.json5
2018-05-14T18:59:23 <cindyli> let me specify the path
2018-05-14T19:01:41 <stegru> try it with a "- " in front

2018-05-14T20:46:29 <cindyli> i read this thread - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16244601/vagrant-reverse-port-forwarding
2018-05-14T20:46:50 <cindyli> the first answer is to use ssh which doesn\'t apply
2018-05-14T20:47:11 <cindyli> so i used 2nd answer: added this line in Vagrantfile: config.vm.network :private_network, ip: "192.169.0.0"
2018-05-14T20:47:16 <cindyli> but it didn\'t work
2018-05-14T20:47:26 <cindyli> do you have suggestions?
