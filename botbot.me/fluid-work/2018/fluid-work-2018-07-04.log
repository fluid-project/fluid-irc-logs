2018-07-04T13:33:20 <Bosmon> sgithens - it\'s true that there should be something, but there isn\'t
2018-07-04T13:33:53 <Bosmon> Right now for its own purposes the ChangeApplier makes use of i) a call to applier.parseEL to parse EL into segments, and then ii) fluid.getSimple since there is no further possibility for interception in models
2018-07-04T13:34:39 <Bosmon> An "applier.get" method would be a nice convenience if you wanted to write one
2018-07-04T13:34:48 <Bosmon> Justin_o - sure, are you free now?
2018-07-04T13:35:25 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes, ready.. where would you like to chat?
2018-07-04T13:38:57 <Bosmon> I guess Skype?

2018-07-04T16:15:03 <the-t-in-rtf> @sgithens, I think the arch meeting will wrap early, I can meet immediately after if you and @Bosmon are available.
2018-07-04T16:29:26 <the-t-in-rtf> @bosmon and @sgithens, we have a unique chance to push the meeting forward if you\'re available.
2018-07-04T16:29:38 <the-t-in-rtf> I will quickly grab my dinner and be back in five.

2018-07-04T17:02:53 <the-t-in-rtf> I will open my room shortly.

2018-07-04T17:06:42 <the-t-in-rtf> @sgithens, I saw you for a moment.
2018-07-04T17:07:04 <sgithens> your room is OsoXQ9RZH5 right?
2018-07-04T17:07:10 <sgithens> Is says the room is locked
2018-07-04T17:07:53 <sgithens> @the-t-in-rtf
2018-07-04T17:08:41 <the-t-in-rtf> It was unlocked, I locked and unlocked it quickly to see if it would help.
2018-07-04T17:08:54 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i just noticed something in one of your other comments for my PR. It says "create a fluid.window.onBeforeUnload global event" What exactly is meant by a global event?
2018-07-04T17:09:41 * simonjb has quit
2018-07-04T17:10:45 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I mean one that is not scoped to your application or a component
2018-07-04T17:10:58 <Bosmon> I guess it could be a true global, or else put on a singleton component
2018-07-04T17:11:11 <Justin_o> I was going to ask how to do that...
2018-07-04T17:11:46 <Justin_o> a singleton component seems plausible.. is that the best approach?
2018-07-04T17:12:03 <Justin_o> i\'m not sure how it would work as a "true global"

2018-07-04T17:16:12 <Bosmon> Justin_o - well obviously I mean a namespaced global : P
2018-07-04T17:16:34 <Bosmon> IN some cases we do just write stuff like fluid.onBeforeUnload = fluid.makeEventFirer() etc.
2018-07-04T17:16:37 <Bosmon> But yes, that would be crappy

2018-07-04T17:27:48 <Bosmon> In that it would make it impossible to bind and unbind to it declaratively
