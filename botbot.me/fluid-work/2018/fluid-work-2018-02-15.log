b"2018-02-15T21:09:43 <cindyli> mayank1495: i believe you will need to use a lower version of php to first get AChecker work locally.
2018-02-15T21:09:58 <cindyli> then worry about the upgrade
2018-02-15T21:17:57 <mayank1495> Ok. Since I already have PHP7 installed, should I use php version manager like phpbrew for this ?
2018-02-15T21:19:52 <cindyli> mayank1495: sounds reasonable
2018-02-15T21:21:06 <cindyli> mayank1495: i'm heading offline. let's talk tomorrow if you have other questions. thanks for your interest in AChecker

2018-02-15T21:22:52 <simonjb> hi Bosmon, are you available for some questions regarding fluid-authoring?
2018-02-15T21:25:11 * kasparnet has quit
2018-02-15T21:29:10 <Bosmon> simonjb - sure
2018-02-15T21:29:19 <simonjb> awesome Bosmon
2018-02-15T21:29:46 <simonjb> I've made some changes so that the grades and model data is rendered in lists (ul)
2018-02-15T21:30:08 <simonjb> and I've been looking at updating the keyboard navigation to use arrow keys
2018-02-15T21:31:05 <simonjb> while thinking about how to best to this I saw that expanding and collapsing nodes in the model or the grades list causes the HTML for all components to be rerendered
2018-02-15T21:31:39 <simonjb> including the component that the user is interacting with
2018-02-15T21:32:01 <simonjb> this means that the element that the user is using will be removed and replaced
2018-02-15T21:32:10 <simonjb> causing focus to be lost
2018-02-15T21:32:55 <Bosmon> simonjb - yes
2018-02-15T21:33:06 <Bosmon> There was some primitive ancient code in the old renderer that tried to counteract this
2018-02-15T21:33:16 <Bosmon> But I don't think it's been effective for years
2018-02-15T21:33:39 <simonjb> updating the expansionModel for a single structureView causes invalidateLayout to be fired on the componentGraph, causing all components to be rerendered
2018-02-15T21:33:51 <simonjb> ok
2018-02-15T21:33:59 <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/renderer/js/fluidRenderer.js#L1475
2018-02-15T21:34:00 <Bosmon> This here
2018-02-15T21:34:32 <Bosmon> Of course, it would be better if the DOM were disturbed as little as possible
2018-02-15T21:35:10 <simonjb> the structureView that the user is interacting with gets rerendered twice
2018-02-15T21:35:33 <simonjb> once due to the expansionModel change and then again due to the global invalidateLayout
2018-02-15T21:37:45 <simonjb> is the global invalidateLayout needed here? is it because the components may move around?
2018-02-15T21:41:18 <simonjb> Bosmon: for now, doing something like in the code you linked may be the simplest, if I understand correctly -- record where focus is, replace content, put focus back?
2018-02-15T21:42:06 <Bosmon> simonjb - yes, they may all change size - although really, an invalidateLayout shouldn't trigger a complete rerender
2018-02-15T21:42:16 <Bosmon> simonjb - yes, that's the basic strategy
2018-02-15T21:42:30 <Bosmon> Perhaps you can get some value out of the ancestral utilities and reconnect them somehow : P
2018-02-15T21:45:03 <simonjb> thanks Bosmon
2018-02-15T21:45:59 <Bosmon> Thanks simonjb!
2018-02-15T21:46:00 <Bosmon> And good luck
2018-02-15T21:46:04 <simonjb> :)

2018-02-15T16:03:44 <the-t-in-rtf> @Bosmon, I meant that it wasn\'t clear to me that that testing module was a part of the codebase to be included in the coverage report, and not yet another helper or fixture only used in the package\'s tests.
2018-02-15T16:04:01 <the-t-in-rtf> There was even a comment in the code about how the use of "test" was confusingly vague there.
2018-02-15T16:04:15 <Bosmon> ok, it\'s a good point
2018-02-15T16:04:22 * Justin_o joined the channel
2018-02-15T16:04:23 <Bosmon> But still rather mysterious that it isn\'t showing coverage
2018-02-15T16:04:30 <the-t-in-rtf> not at all mysterious
2018-02-15T16:04:34 <the-t-in-rtf> I intentionally excluded it.
2018-02-15T16:04:36 * danayo_ joined the channel
2018-02-15T16:04:42 <the-t-in-rtf> it\'s mysterious that it has any at this point.
2018-02-15T16:04:57 <the-t-in-rtf> If I know which is the goal, I can work to make it all match.. ;)
2018-02-15T16:05:02 <Bosmon> Well sure
2018-02-15T16:05:16 <Bosmon> Given it is a piece of infrastructure, I think it would be good to know if it has coverage
2018-02-15T16:05:24 <Bosmon> If parts of it are not being used by tests, they could be removed
2018-02-15T16:05:35 <the-t-in-rtf> OK, that bit wasn\'t clear, easy enough to update the config and rerun.
2018-02-15T16:05:48 <Bosmon> great
2018-02-15T16:06:11 <Bosmon> Hey there kasparnet
2018-02-15T16:06:15 <Justin_o> Bosmon: would you be able to expand upon this comment you left on my PR https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/867#discussion_r166663906
2018-02-15T16:06:36 <kasparnet> hey Bosmon
2018-02-15T16:07:06 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf was wondering if you had time to make that little pull to fix the infusion update for universal...
2018-02-15T16:07:53 <kasparnet> sure, gimme a sec
2018-02-15T16:08:00 <Justin_o> Bosmon: also for this thread of discussion, https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/867#pullrequestreview-86399946 i haven\'t been able to achieve a case that works for both a panelIndex passed in via the defaults and from the data store
2018-02-15T16:08:02 <kasparnet> did you figure out what the other issue was?
2018-02-15T16:10:17 <Bosmon> kasparnet - yes, listed on the JIRA
2018-02-15T16:10:22 <Bosmon> Just a version mistmatch
2018-02-15T16:12:11 <kasparnet> ah nice
2018-02-15T16:13:05 <kasparnet> but howcome it never failed before the update? if it never loaded infusion?
2018-02-15T16:13:23 <Bosmon> Well, before the update, all the versions of infusion demanded by the dependencies were the same
2018-02-15T16:13:30 * colinclark joined the channel
2018-02-15T16:13:34 <Bosmon> As soon as we update one of them, it triggers the bug, which requires all of them to be updated again
2018-02-15T16:14:03 <Bosmon> The bug was due to the behaviour when mismatched versions of Infusion try to register an onUncaughtException handler
2018-02-15T16:14:25 <Bosmon> It\'s now possible to mismatch versions of infusion (a bit) but they all need to date from after the fix
2018-02-15T16:14:39 <Bosmon> Which was around November of last year
2018-02-15T16:16:52 <kasparnet> cool - well, glad it wasn\'t anything major

2018-02-15T16:30:23 <kasparnet> on it
2018-02-15T16:30:56 <kasparnet> ... i guess after what you just told me, I should have probably realized that I should update all three versions :)
2018-02-15T16:39:30 <kasparnet> ok, updated the pull
2018-02-15T16:39:39 <kasparnet> ran all the tests locally and no explosions
2018-02-15T16:43:24 <Bosmon> kasparnet - fantastic!
2018-02-15T17:11:42 <kasparnet> when I said all tests, i meant node tests
2018-02-15T17:11:50 <kasparnet> ... looks like some webbased ones are failing
2018-02-15T17:11:54 <kasparnet> looking into it right now
2018-02-15T17:13:20 * michelled has quit
2018-02-15T17:19:40 <Bosmon> kasparnet - yes, the web tests is yours
2018-02-15T17:19:50 <Bosmon> SOmehow the node tests are still giving the issue one would expect from mismatched deps
2018-02-15T17:20:01 <Bosmon> But I just tested it out locally and it was fine
2018-02-15T17:20:15 <Bosmon> With a clean checkout
2018-02-15T17:21:26 <kasparnet> Bosmon, ugh, just looked at the web test
2018-02-15T17:21:46 <kasparnet> the issue comes from the same change in the transformation framework
2018-02-15T17:22:00 <kasparnet> where we check whether we\'re able to invert something before doing so
2018-02-15T17:22:40 <kasparnet> in this case, it happens (the first of two failing tests, anyway) because we\'re trying to invert the ISO->flat ontology, which it claims is not invertible
2018-02-15T17:23:36 <kasparnet> which actually is pretty weird, because it looks very invertible to me
2018-02-15T17:23:47 <kasparnet> ... I\'ll see if I can find which one it is complaining about
2018-02-15T17:24:25 <kasparnet> perhaps it\'s due to the "" key
2018-02-15T17:24:57 <kasparnet> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/ontologies/mappings/ISO24751-flat.json5#L60
2018-02-15T17:28:48 <Bosmon> Shouldn\'t be anything wrong with a "" key .....

2018-02-15T19:40:54 <Bosmon> stegru - extremely sneaky!
2018-02-15T19:41:01 <Bosmon> Only adding the modelComponent grade in windowsMetrics - https://github.com/GPII/windows/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/windowsMetrics/src/windowsMetrics.js#L31
2018-02-15T19:41:12 <Bosmon> Despite it not having any model material
2018-02-15T19:41:20 <Bosmon> This makes the model listener registration from the base grade actually work : P
2018-02-15T19:41:38 <stegru> oh! that wasn\'t on purpose
2018-02-15T19:41:39 <Bosmon> This is why we don\'t see any funky stuff in the universal tests relating to the failure jhernandez saw ...................
2018-02-15T19:41:55 <Bosmon> I\'m sure it was subconsciously on purpose :)
2018-02-15T19:42:18 <Bosmon> The node 8.x debugger is amazing btw, if you haven\'t tried it recently......
2018-02-15T19:42:59 <stegru> no I\'m still on 6.1.9
2018-02-15T19:43:26 <Bosmon> OK, so now I can reproduce his failure self-containedly in universal
2018-02-15T19:43:27 <stegru> oh yes, i see what i did (without realising it)
2018-02-15T19:43:51 <Bosmon> It\'s a bit annoying the current infusion that if you don\'t list modelComponent, it doesn\'t even register modelListeners on OTHER components
2018-02-15T19:45:26 <stegru> well, I thought it did, that\'s why it worked. The modelComponent happened to be there by accident
2018-02-15T19:45:58 <stegru> hacksidental
2018-02-15T19:46:39 <Bosmon> So I think this means that your fix is fine - since it is a special case where we get a "logout" state as a result of an error during login
2018-02-15T19:46:49 <Bosmon> Which means that the LifecycleManager has never opened a session at all
2018-02-15T19:46:56 <Bosmon> But this, as usual, raises the question of "how this has ever worked"
2018-02-15T19:48:03 <stegru> don\'t start questioning.. move away slowly
2018-02-15T19:48:06 <Bosmon> bah
2018-02-15T19:49:19 <Bosmon> It\'ll have to be slowly
2018-02-15T19:49:40 <Bosmon> Since it\'ll take me another 30 minutes to run a fresh npm install of everything inside my vagrant box to check up on current trunk : P

2018-02-15T20:15:19 <Bosmon> Fascinatingly it seems to be something to do with the fact that this metrics code doesn\'t execute during the tests for trunk at all
2018-02-15T20:15:37 <Bosmon> Which I imagine in turn is something to do with the fact that the gpii.contexts.windows context isn\'t found
2018-02-15T20:19:06 <mayank1495> Hi, I am interested in the "Upgrade AChecker" and "Inclusively Design & Build a Game for Kids" projects. How should I proceed ?
2018-02-15T20:23:25 <cindyli> hi mayank1495, i\'m the mentor of "Upgrade AChecker", to start on that, you can start with cloning the achecker github repo, install a local copy and get familiar with its design and code base. when you are ready, pick some simple bugs from its bug tracker: http://www.atutor.ca/atutor/mantis/my_view_page.php
2018-02-15T20:25:30 <cindyli> simonjb: can you take a look on this universal pull request when you have time - https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/585?
2018-02-15T20:25:54 <cindyli> my GPII-2630 branch should be ready soon and it\'s dependent on this pull

2018-02-15T20:27:10 <mayank1495> OK. Thanks a lot.
2018-02-15T20:28:18 <Bosmon> Well, I\'m wrong - gpii.metrics.windows *is* applied
2018-02-15T20:28:36 <Bosmon> BUT - fluid.modelComponent isn\'t!
2018-02-15T20:29:45 <Bosmon> HAH!
2018-02-15T20:29:55 <Bosmon> Because trunk binds to a version of gpii-windows that doesn\'t have the metrics in at all!!!!!!

2018-02-15T20:46:51 <Bosmon> We really, really do need to turn this all into a monorepo ....
2018-02-15T20:56:04 <mayank1495> cindyli, On installation page it says Your server does not meet the minimum requirements. It has: "mysql" Disabled and "MySQL 4.1.10+" Not found.
2018-02-15T20:57:48 <mayank1495> We should use "mysqli" and "mysql_get_client_info" is deprecated .
2018-02-15T20:58:58 <cindyli> good finding, mayank1495. that should be a part of the upgrade too.
2018-02-15T21:06:09 <mayank1495> Yes, But how should I proceed with the installation for now ? If I change the install/index.php file , will it work as the requirements wont match I suppose ?

2018-02-15T09:59:43 <the-t-in-rtf> @Bosmon, resuming work on the universal code coverage pull.
2018-02-15T09:59:53 <the-t-in-rtf> I just hit the failing test with the incomplete transform output.
2018-02-15T10:00:26 <the-t-in-rtf> Do I just need to merge with upstream/master to pick up a new enough version of infusion, or will I need to update that as well?
2018-02-15T10:00:42 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - not just that, but I think kasparnet has a fix
2018-02-15T10:00:54 <the-t-in-rtf> 10:57:40.357:  jq: FAIL: Module "gpii.matchMakerFramework tests" Test name "inferCommonTerms Tests" - Message: Testing with application specific only settings

2018-02-15T10:01:14 * the-t-in-rtf joined the channel
2018-02-15T10:01:22 <Bosmon> There are two bugs - firstly the actual change in MT, and then the failure due to upgrading mismatched versions of jqunit and kettle
2018-02-15T10:01:22 <the-t-in-rtf> Sorry, I was trying to trim that down before sending.
2018-02-15T10:01:53 <the-t-in-rtf> Is there a dev release with his fixes?
2018-02-15T10:02:07 <the-t-in-rtf> or I guess a set of dev releases?
2018-02-15T10:02:22 <Bosmon> Oh right
2018-02-15T10:02:28 <Bosmon> I guess the problem was actually in Infusion
2018-02-15T10:02:36 <Bosmon> Although it\'s a bit early in the morning for me to be sure : P
2018-02-15T10:03:32 <Bosmon> In which case all you need is the latest dev release of Infusion and the latest full releases of jqunit and kettle

2018-02-15T10:35:44 <the-t-in-rtf> @Bosmon, nope, still fails.
2018-02-15T10:36:39 <the-t-in-rtf> it won\'t prevent me from trying things with nyc, just let me know what if anything I should try once you\'re all the way awake.
2018-02-15T10:39:19 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - with the mouseTrailing issue?
2018-02-15T10:39:28 <the-t-in-rtf> yup.
2018-02-15T10:39:31 <Bosmon> ok
2018-02-15T10:39:36 <Bosmon> I guess kasparnet will be here in a bit
2018-02-15T10:42:21 <the-t-in-rtf> Our morning Danish, as it were.
2018-02-15T10:43:16 <Bosmon> Oh right, now I read more carefully he says "This can be easily fixed on the universal side by adding an inverseCapabilitiesTransformations block to the mousetrailing solution."
2018-02-15T10:43:22 <Bosmon> So it requires a fix in universal as well as in infusion
2018-02-15T10:47:42 <the-t-in-rtf> The require trick with nyc seems to have at least woken it up to the fact that there is some coverage data.
2018-02-15T10:48:00 <the-t-in-rtf> Try a few systematic variations now.
2018-02-15T10:48:58 <the-t-in-rtf> What\'s odd to me is that I had in fact tried running the tests from a complete instrumented mirror universe directory, with no results.
2018-02-15T10:49:12 <the-t-in-rtf> It may be that there is some mechanism it takes advantage of that doesn\'t work with fluid.require.
2018-02-15T10:49:48 <the-t-in-rtf> trying just changing fluid.require("%universal") to require("../index.js") in all-tests to see if my theory is correct.
2018-02-15T11:04:06 <the-t-in-rtf> That made a big difference.
2018-02-15T11:04:43 <the-t-in-rtf> It seems like we had two problems, one with collecting data and one with filtering it out.
2018-02-15T11:05:01 <the-t-in-rtf> Using bare-require statements, suddenly I\'m back to dealing mainly with the second one.
2018-02-15T11:05:08 <the-t-in-rtf> @Bosmon ^^^
2018-02-15T11:08:52 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - I see
2018-02-15T11:09:10 <Bosmon> Yes, I seem to remember that these instrumenters tend to look for literal require statements in order to decide what to instrument
2018-02-15T11:09:28 <Bosmon> So we may well have to go with the "concrete manifest" approach
2018-02-15T11:26:18 <the-t-in-rtf> So, I just reviewed all usages of fluid.require in that package, looks like we would only have to manually require universal itself and maybe one other.
2018-02-15T11:26:25 <the-t-in-rtf> (from the test file, I mean)

2018-02-15T11:28:55 <the-t-in-rtf> if my theory is correct, we could even let nyc do its own instrumentation.
2018-02-15T11:29:42 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, "concrete manifest"?
2018-02-15T11:33:05 * mredigonda joined the channel
2018-02-15T11:58:27 <the-t-in-rtf> I also have a theory that it may be enough to pass the current require to fluid.require
2018-02-15T11:58:44 <the-t-in-rtf> In my reading, seems like nyc and others hook babel into require itself.

2018-02-15T12:24:27 <the-t-in-rtf> @bosmon, my theory was correct
2018-02-15T12:24:36 <the-t-in-rtf> passing the current require to fluid.require is enough to allow the instrumentation work
2018-02-15T12:24:50 <the-t-in-rtf> and you only have to do that in the test file, seemingly.
2018-02-15T12:24:58 <Bosmon> Wow
2018-02-15T12:25:00 <Bosmon> How interesting
2018-02-15T12:25:04 <the-t-in-rtf> Crazy, right.
2018-02-15T12:25:12 <Bosmon> Well, it\'s milder than some alternatives
2018-02-15T12:25:35 <the-t-in-rtf> I will add a comment there explaining why it needs to be that way and then moved on to the combined report.
2018-02-15T12:25:42 <Bosmon> Fantastic!
2018-02-15T12:25:47 <the-t-in-rtf> Hopefully this will be the last trip down the rabbit hole.
2018-02-15T12:26:03 <the-t-in-rtf> The rabbits and I are on a first name basis at this point.
2018-02-15T12:26:28 <Bosmon> Mopsy, Cotton-tail and Peter

2018-02-15T12:28:57 <the-t-in-rtf> I was thinking more of the velveteen rabbit, the one the kid\'s parents burned because of scarlet fever.
2018-02-15T12:29:32 <the-t-in-rtf> or maybe the rabbits from Watership Down
2018-02-15T12:32:12 <the-t-in-rtf> In other good news, I figured out a clean approach to adding the required double-negatives to include the gpii/node_modules/ content we want to see in the report.
2018-02-15T12:35:33 <Bosmon> How does it work?
2018-02-15T12:37:33 <Bosmon> LET\'S FIND OUT!!!
2018-02-15T12:42:03 <stegru> jhernandez: are you tracking gpii-app master for the pilots? or, what branch should I work on for a fix for the pilot?
2018-02-15T12:42:57 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, I can\'t generate a combined report in one pass until the test failure is fixed, but I did run all the steps manually.
2018-02-15T12:43:22 <the-t-in-rtf> You\'ll get a new report as soon as GitHub pages refreshes.
2018-02-15T12:43:41 <jhernandez> stegru: this is the branch I used for the pilots https://github.com/javihernandez/gpii-app/commits/base-PSP-Listeners%2BPCP-client
2018-02-15T12:44:02 <jhernandez> which I originally took from gloob
2018-02-15T12:44:24 <jhernandez> in any case, it should be fine if you track gpii-app/master
2018-02-15T12:44:28 <stegru> ok thank jhernandez..
2018-02-15T12:44:31 <stegru> ok
2018-02-15T12:44:41 <the-t-in-rtf> http://the-t-in-rtf.github.io/coverage-reports/universal/20180216/
2018-02-15T12:45:10 <jhernandez> stegru: if you think that the fix could eventually end up in master, yes, use master
2018-02-15T12:45:24 <stegru> yes, javi
2018-02-15T12:45:31 <jhernandez> gracias, esteban
2018-02-15T12:46:01 <stegru> but! the fix will depend on windows having the user-listeners PR
2018-02-15T12:46:36 <stegru> the fix has nothing to do with listeners, but that branch has code that I want
2018-02-15T12:47:08 <jhernandez> ok, then use the first I shared with yo
2018-02-15T12:47:11 <jhernandez> *you
2018-02-15T12:47:33 <stegru> aye
2018-02-15T13:03:38 <the-t-in-rtf> OK, @bosmon and/or the late @dastardnet, I fixed everything I can without getting that transform working.
2018-02-15T13:03:51 <the-t-in-rtf> Is anyone working on that?  I probably could look at it if there are some details somewhere.

2018-02-15T14:18:52 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: Hey, Antranig! We have just finished the tests for the webview preload script. They are available in the survey PR.
2018-02-15T14:18:58 <Bosmon> These utilities are all heavily used in the acceptance tests
