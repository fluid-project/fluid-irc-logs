2018-02-02T14:30:00 <cindyli> Bosmon: i created a jira about the broken browser channel example in the universal master - https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2843, seeking your advice
2018-02-02T14:30:18 <Bosmon> cheers cindyli, yes, it\'s an interesting issue
2018-02-02T14:31:15 <Bosmon> Raises the issue about how our default "dev" configuration is going to work after our current round of changes
2018-02-02T14:34:39 <cindyli> Bosmon: what changes do you mean?
2018-02-02T14:35:00 <cindyli> i\'m thinking the GPII config used for the browser channel request handler probably should be the local flow manager config instead of the cloud based
2018-02-02T14:35:05 <Bosmon> cindyli - making the "untrusted" our default configuration, and eliminating all of our old-fashioned prefs server endpoints
2018-02-02T14:35:13 <Bosmon> cindyli - yes, I think so
2018-02-02T14:35:57 <cindyli> Bosmon: i\'ve made those changes to the config file in my GPII-2630 branch
2018-02-02T14:36:17 <Bosmon> ok great
2018-02-02T14:36:18 <cindyli> you will be one of the reviewers of that branch anyway

2018-02-02T14:54:33 <Bosmon> Wow
2018-02-02T14:54:36 <Bosmon> As simple as that
2018-02-02T14:54:37 <Bosmon> Thanks :)
2018-02-02T14:57:04 <cindyli> :)

2018-02-02T20:41:44 <cindyli> colinclark: i\'ve got to the point that needs to have a live remote cloud-based flow manager set up to run my integration test against to test the production config. This live server will be created based on my GPII-2630 branch. do you have an idea whom from the ops team I can pair up with?
2018-02-02T20:42:15 <colinclark> yes, you and I should sit down and chat with mrtyler about it
2018-02-02T20:42:26 <colinclark> but it looks like he\'s away
2018-02-02T20:42:40 * alanharnum has quit
2018-02-02T20:42:46 * alanharnum2 joined the channel
2018-02-02T20:42:49 <cindyli> ok, we can check in again on monday, what do you think, colinclark
2018-02-02T20:42:53 <colinclark> sure
2018-02-02T20:43:05 <colinclark> cindyli, mrtyler has been working on provisionable development clusters that run on Amazon AWS
2018-02-02T20:43:26 <colinclark> the idea being that, when it\'s ready, any developer can spin up a development cluster to do integration testing
2018-02-02T20:43:32 <colinclark> and presumably one will be available for CI
2018-02-02T20:44:36 <cindyli> that\'s cool
2018-02-02T20:44:47 <colinclark> we\'ll presumably use amatas\' gpii-vagrant-ci plugin to help orchestrate 1) the provisioning of a development cluster for integration testing, 2) launching any associated local VMs that are used for testing and 3) cleanup of #1 and #2
2018-02-02T20:45:05 <colinclark> I\'m not sure how soon we\'ll be ready to do that, though
2018-02-02T20:45:31 <cindyli> good to know the new plugin is about to be ready
2018-02-02T20:45:31 <colinclark> in the meantime, though, can you tell me a bit more...
2018-02-02T20:45:44 <colinclark> have you ever, in the past, run integration tests against a CBFM?
2018-02-02T20:45:55 <colinclark> or is this essentially some new functionality that you need now?
2018-02-02T20:46:27 <cindyli> no, but in the universal repo, we do have tests that run against the live preferences server: https://preferences.gpii.net
2018-02-02T20:46:39 <colinclark> hmm
2018-02-02T20:46:44 <colinclark> that\'s somewhat interesting
2018-02-02T20:46:44 <cindyli> i talked to Bosmon earlier on how to fix it
2018-02-02T20:46:51 <colinclark> yes, I remember
2018-02-02T20:47:09 <cindyli> he said it runs against the live prefs server is cuz it\'s old and outdated
2018-02-02T20:47:10 <colinclark> Do you need to run these tests on your own development machine while you\'re developing, or do you think it would be sufficient for CI to run these integration tests against a CBFM, for example, when pull requests are submitted?
2018-02-02T20:47:18 <colinclark> yes, it sounds like that should be fixed
2018-02-02T20:48:13 <cindyli> we have these tests running both on the local dev machine and against the live server
2018-02-02T20:48:29 <colinclark> i can\'t tell if that answered my question :)
2018-02-02T20:48:42 <colinclark> do you need them to run both ways? or just that they currently do? :)
2018-02-02T20:48:46 <cindyli> yes
2018-02-02T20:48:56 <cindyli> i think it would be nice to run both ways
2018-02-02T20:49:27 <cindyli> so we can make sure the live server is deployed and functions properly
2018-02-02T20:50:31 <cindyli> this live server would be a deployment for testing and contain only the test data
2018-02-02T20:51:30 <colinclark> do you ever make changes to the CBFM on computer, and then want to test them out in that "live server" configuration?
2018-02-02T20:51:41 <colinclark> on your computer\xe2\x80\x94prior to committing the changes, I mean
2018-02-02T20:52:10 <cindyli> that\'s a good question
2018-02-02T20:53:16 <cindyli> if CBFM is changed in a branch, the live server will need to be redeployed before that change can test with the live testing server
2018-02-02T20:53:32 <cindyli> what a trouble
2018-02-02T20:53:51 <colinclark> right, or you\'ll have to build the appropriate container on your own computer and then somehow pass it off to the server-provisioning process
2018-02-02T20:54:05 <cindyli> true
2018-02-02T20:54:28 <colinclark> or, what I always preferred but is looking less likely for the time being, you can provision an entire server cluster within a VM on your computer
2018-02-02T20:54:58 <cindyli> i\'\'m doing it this way at the moment
2018-02-02T20:55:03 <colinclark> right
2018-02-02T20:55:13 <cindyli> on my local computer to make sure this integration test works
2018-02-02T20:55:34 <colinclark> with the trade-off that the "server" in this case isn\'t the same as what our production environment will actually look like
2018-02-02T20:56:07 <colinclark> so my sense is that, at least for a while, we\'re going to spin up our own dev clusters that are identical to prod
2018-02-02T20:56:31 <colinclark> I think Tyler has thought through what this process will look like, but I\'d guess that there is still some work to be done
2018-02-02T20:57:01 <cindyli> great Tyler has thought about it
