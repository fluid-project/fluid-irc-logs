2018-10-31T10:09:08 <jhernandez> have a question regarding the performance issues you found a few days ago
2018-10-31T10:09:15 <stegru> ok
2018-10-31T10:09:51 <jhernandez> was it reported as a JIRA? are you planning to ship it as part of an ongoing pull request or the like?
2018-10-31T10:10:07 <jhernandez> not a blocker, but just curious
2018-10-31T10:10:28 <stegru> https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3471
2018-10-31T10:11:31 <stegru> I'm not fixing it because i no longer need to
2018-10-31T10:13:32 <jhernandez> oh, okay
