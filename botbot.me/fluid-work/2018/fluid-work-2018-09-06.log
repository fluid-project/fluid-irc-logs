2018-09-06T08:23:48 <the-t-in-rtf> @javjarfer[m] (or anyone, really), when is the last time you tested with ReadWriteGold?
2018-09-06T08:24:26 <the-t-in-rtf> I am looking at its solutions registry entry by comparison with the JAWS entry, and just want to make sure I\'m comparing rotten apples and fresh oranges.
2018-09-06T08:26:00 <the-t-in-rtf> Specifically, I\'m trying to figure out this error:
2018-09-06T08:26:01 <the-t-in-rtf> https://www.pastiebin.com/5b90e48c81793
2018-09-06T08:26:08 <the-t-in-rtf> "file" argument must be a non-empty string.
2018-09-06T08:26:32 <the-t-in-rtf> I\'ll pump up the logging to get more details, but it would help to know which (if any) solutions entries have been recently verified working.
2018-09-06T08:44:16 <the-t-in-rtf> Turns out, it\'s what @stegru and I started discussing yesterday.
2018-09-06T08:44:33 <the-t-in-rtf> i.e.this entry doesn\'t resolve:
2018-09-06T08:44:34 <the-t-in-rtf> "command": "\\"${{registry}.HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\App Paths\\\\JAWS2018.exe\\\\}\\""
2018-09-06T08:45:02 <the-t-in-rtf> It ends up in the logs as: "command": undefined
2018-09-06T08:45:43 <the-t-in-rtf> I assume someone has tested an entry that uses the registry resolver recently?

2018-09-06T09:05:31 <the-t-in-rtf> Does anyone know a preference set that uses ReadWriteGold that\'s verified working recently?
2018-09-06T09:05:45 <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. one in universal/testData, like andrei.json?
2018-09-06T09:06:22 <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/preferences/andrei.json5#L8
2018-09-06T09:14:23 <the-t-in-rtf> andrei seems to work at least for narrator.
2018-09-06T09:17:08 <the-t-in-rtf> Although it never seems to try anything with RWG.
2018-09-06T09:19:11 * colinclark joined the channel
2018-09-06T09:21:17 <the-t-in-rtf> The language setting uses the registry resolver, and catalina.json5 can log in in master.
2018-09-06T09:21:20 <the-t-in-rtf> trying now with my branch.
2018-09-06T09:53:44 <the-t-in-rtf> AHA.
2018-09-06T09:53:53 <the-t-in-rtf> andrei has the same error in my branch.
2018-09-06T09:54:02 * colinclark joined the channel
2018-09-06T09:54:42 <the-t-in-rtf> so it\'s the context in which you use the registry resolver that matters
2018-09-06T09:54:46 <the-t-in-rtf> or at least if it fails for setting language it\'s a silent error.

2018-09-06T10:04:42 <stegru> the-t-in-rtf, I\'ve used the registry resolver recently, and I think it\'s ok
2018-09-06T10:04:54 <the-t-in-rtf> Yes, it\'s fine in master.
2018-09-06T10:05:02 <the-t-in-rtf> I need to understand why it doesn\'t work in my branch.
2018-09-06T10:05:12 <the-t-in-rtf> I\'m going back to the pull now and looking at the diffs.
2018-09-06T10:05:23 <stegru> try it without the \'\\\\\' near the end?
2018-09-06T10:05:37 <stegru> JAWS2018.exe}\\""
2018-09-06T10:05:40 <the-t-in-rtf> already did that
2018-09-06T10:05:48 <the-t-in-rtf> it was a good suggestion but didn\'t help.
2018-09-06T10:05:51 <stegru> does the registry key exist?
2018-09-06T10:06:01 <the-t-in-rtf> no.
2018-09-06T10:06:21 <the-t-in-rtf> but it doesn\'t in the VM I created for master either.
2018-09-06T10:06:26 <the-t-in-rtf> and that doesn\'t crash.
2018-09-06T10:06:31 <stegru> oh, right
2018-09-06T10:06:58 <stegru> I would expect it to crash always
2018-09-06T10:13:51 <stegru> it crashes for me
2018-09-06T10:13:58 * colinclark has quit
2018-09-06T10:20:15 <the-t-in-rtf> are you in master, or using something with your INI fix?
2018-09-06T10:20:56 <the-t-in-rtf> also, where are you running gpii.js from?
2018-09-06T10:24:34 <stegru> i\'m in your 2225, and (almost) windows master
2018-09-06T10:25:36 <the-t-in-rtf> and are you running from c:/vagrant or v:/?
2018-09-06T10:26:05 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, it\'s a short day, can we do a screen share together tomorrow say at around 11:00?
2018-09-06T10:26:06 <stegru> c:vagrant
2018-09-06T10:26:12 <stegru> yes
2018-09-06T10:26:15 <the-t-in-rtf> oh, I thought I liked you.
2018-09-06T10:26:17 <the-t-in-rtf> v:/
2018-09-06T10:26:20 <the-t-in-rtf> v:
2018-09-06T10:26:22 <the-t-in-rtf> always v:
2018-09-06T10:26:37 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, we can try that and many other things tomorrow.
2018-09-06T10:26:44 <the-t-in-rtf> Thanks in advance for your continued help.
2018-09-06T10:26:48 <stegru> yes, that\'s ok
