2018-05-02T16:15:36 <cindyli> mrtyler: continue the chat about the gpii-infra data loading job from yesterday, I'm thinking to refactor the docker-preferences-dataloader repo to make it load data from several directories, then we can use one job for data loading
2018-05-02T16:16:03 <cindyli> let me know if you have other ideas
2018-05-02T16:16:48 <mrtyler> cindyli: that's one of the solutions i thought of yesterday, yes
2018-05-02T16:16:55 <mrtyler> i think you and i should chat about it today
2018-05-02T16:17:05 <mrtyler> i'd like to make sure i understand the problem well

2018-05-02T17:00:40 <Justin_o> gtirloni: i'm noticing that my buildkite check for a PR failed. https://buildkite.com/fluid-project/fluid-infusion/builds/212#5ef81bee-ee5f-440a-bc7e-d62ab3f0a357
2018-05-02T17:00:51 <Justin_o> for the code linting, am I reading it correct in that Grunt is missing?
2018-05-02T17:02:10 <gtirloni> Justin_o: yes
2018-05-02T17:02:29 <Justin_o> hmm.. why do you think that would happen?
2018-05-02T17:04:02 <gtirloni> i'm not sure but i can check. `npm install` seem to have finished successfully
2018-05-02T17:05:03 <cindyli> mrtyler: ready to meet?

2018-05-02T19:07:23 <gtirloni> Justin_o: it was a regression in the agent configuration. i've fixed and added a test to avoid it in the future

2018-05-02T19:07:43 <Justin_o> gtirloni: thanks... where did you need to make the fix?
2018-05-02T19:08:02 <gtirloni> in the agent configuration itself, the server... not the repo
2018-05-02T19:08:22 <Justin_o> gtirloni: ah okay
