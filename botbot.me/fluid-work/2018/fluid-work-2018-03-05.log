2018-03-05T15:30:53 <Bosmon> Hey there amatas - the-t-in-rtf is having a problem with the CI on one of his pulls
2018-03-05T15:31:04 <Bosmon> https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/537
2018-03-05T15:31:05 <amatas> which PR?
2018-03-05T15:31:09 <amatas> let me see
2018-03-05T15:31:09 <Bosmon> There\'s a build failure that we can\'t reproduce
2018-03-05T15:31:24 <Bosmon> It seems to be something quite severe, like a file being entirely missing
2018-03-05T15:31:40 <Bosmon> Is there some way we can investigate the VM that did it to find out what its file layout is?
2018-03-05T15:32:10 <Bosmon> thanks
2018-03-05T15:32:59 <amatas> The VMs are destroyed once the tests finish. I always try to reproduce the error using the same commands as the CI executes
2018-03-05T15:33:55 <the-t-in-rtf> That\'s what I did.
2018-03-05T15:34:15 <the-t-in-rtf> No error when provisioning the same image and running the same commands against it.
2018-03-05T15:34:29 <the-t-in-rtf> There are comments to that effect on the PR.
2018-03-05T15:36:36 <amatas> I\'m reading them, it\'s odd
2018-03-05T15:36:52 <amatas> let me see if something is wrong at the testing host
2018-03-05T15:49:23 <amatas> the-t-in-rtf, Bosmon: I got the same error on my local PC
2018-03-05T15:49:35 <amatas> and this is the message that I can see at the VM: https://ibb.co/iWLS8S
2018-03-05T15:51:06 <the-t-in-rtf> OK, how is that the same error?
2018-03-05T15:51:26 <the-t-in-rtf> I mean, the other was complaining about a global object not being present.
2018-03-05T15:52:13 <the-t-in-rtf> https://ci.gpii.net/job/universal-browser-tests/732/console
2018-03-05T15:52:16 <amatas> the-t-in-rtf: at the command line console I got: not ok 1 Firefox 58.0 - Global error: TypeError: iframeWin.QUnit is undefined at http://localhost:7357/8964/node_modules/infusion/tests/lib/qunit/addons/composite/qunit-composite.js, line 59
2018-03-05T15:52:54 <the-t-in-rtf> That\'s interesting.
2018-03-05T15:53:03 <the-t-in-rtf> So, when you say, on your local machine, you mean without using Vagrant?
2018-03-05T15:53:19 <the-t-in-rtf> No, you said in the VM.
2018-03-05T15:53:29 <the-t-in-rtf> Any idea why the behaviour would be different?
2018-03-05T15:54:16 <amatas> perhaps you have that file in your source tree?
2018-03-05T15:54:59 <amatas> I mean MatchMakerUtilitiesTest.html
2018-03-05T15:55:34 <the-t-in-rtf> Well, it should be pulling an instrumented version of that, just checking that now.
2018-03-05T15:55:52 <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. if the instrumentation failed that would explain it.
2018-03-05T15:56:08 <amatas> I have cloned a new universal repo, checked out your PR and executed "vagrant destroy -f && vagrant up && vagrant ssh -c \'cd /home/vagrant/sync/universal; npm run test:browser\'"
2018-03-05T15:56:24 <amatas> the same steps that the CI does
2018-03-05T15:56:43 <the-t-in-rtf> yes, I think the difference is that I may have already had instrumented content in the instrumented subdir.
2018-03-05T15:57:10 <the-t-in-rtf> There are now better controls for moving that to a temp dir, testing my theory now to see if that\'s the explanation.
2018-03-05T15:57:36 <amatas> right, that is my guess

2018-03-05T16:53:37 <Sunny0794> Hello Everyone!! Can I get some more info/refernece on Print Workflows. I have been researching on project idea -- Inclusive Design Guide Digital-Print copy workflow prototypes and trying to come up with a implementation of  the same.
2018-03-05T16:54:13 <Sunny0794> I am taking some reference from here...- https://www.fespa.com/en/news-media/features/print-workflow-what-you-need-to-know
2018-03-05T16:55:08 <Sunny0794> Anyone with some other source/reference please post here, It will be a great help.

2018-03-05T17:09:01 <jhung> Sunny0794: interesting article thanks for sharing that The article is more for commercial / large scale print productions. What we\'re looking for is small scale on-demand printing. We update the source content (web and print) 5 or 6 times a year, and print the resource maybe 2 or 3 times a year.Most of
2018-03-05T17:09:27 <jhung> the traffic is to the online version, but we want a process that ensures that the print copy is up to date with changes as well.
2018-03-05T17:13:47 <Sunny0794> jhung: Yes sir, I am getting it. The aim is to make a small scale on-demand printing which will get synchronised with any changes made.

2018-03-05T17:59:22 <the-t-in-rtf> @amatas, turns out it was the lack of the instrumented directory, thanks for investigating.
2018-03-05T17:59:43 <amatas> np :)
2018-03-05T18:00:12 <the-t-in-rtf> The error is somewhat misleading, I suspect that that\'s the first browser error that Testem captures and that the visible one is further along.
2018-03-05T18:01:06 <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. testem throws a failure when the browser goes over the cliff even if the browse subsequently hits the ground and explodes.
2018-03-05T18:01:12 <the-t-in-rtf> browser
2018-03-05T18:05:04 <amatas> I\'m not very familiar with testem, but it seems that the testem process keeps running even if the tests at the browser have failed, and gets stuck waiting for something
2018-03-05T18:05:49 * JessM joined the channel
2018-03-05T18:07:55 <the-t-in-rtf> well, there is a callback that must be called to let testem know that it is safe to finish the tests.
2018-03-05T18:08:19 <the-t-in-rtf> if that\'s not called, it does indeed overstay its welcome.
2018-03-05T18:08:58 <stegru> jhernandez: did you find the cause of the "Object has been destroyed" error?

2018-03-05T18:40:31 <cindyli> amatas, gtirloni, when I manually run vagrantCloudBasedContainers.sh inside the universal VM, it constantly fails at this line https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/scripts/vagrantCloudBasedContainers.sh#L55, with error "curl: (56) Recv failure: Connection reset by peer"
2018-03-05T18:40:44 <cindyli> switching to "wget" will work around the problem
2018-03-05T18:41:03 <gtirloni> does it continue after that?
2018-03-05T18:41:11 <cindyli> no, it stops at that error
2018-03-05T18:41:26 <cindyli> i know this script works fine in CI, which is confusing
2018-03-05T18:41:27 <amatas> curl fails and the script ends
2018-03-05T18:41:31 <gtirloni> ok, amatas opened an issue for that
2018-03-05T18:41:32 <cindyli> right
2018-03-05T18:41:37 <cindyli> thanks
2018-03-05T18:41:49 <gtirloni> it\'s a timing issue, maybe your computer is a little bit slower in getting couchdb ready
2018-03-05T18:41:59 <cindyli> possible
2018-03-05T18:42:10 <cindyli> let me adjust the wait time
2018-03-05T18:42:29 <gtirloni> ok. using wget might be the sensible choice for now
2018-03-05T18:42:59 <gtirloni> i expected curl to be lower-level than wget, but it\'s making a lot of assumptions about what is and is not a "transient" error.. which is leading to this issue
