2018-09-28T08:52:57 <georgitodorov> Hey, Bosmon, jhernandez! Any news regarding the strange test failing behavior that we observed yesterday?
2018-09-28T09:12:13 * dandimitrov joined the channel
2018-09-28T09:52:11 <Bosmon> Hi there georgitodorov - I\'ve written up the problem at https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3409 and I think cindy could be able to look at it when she gets in
2018-09-28T09:52:37 <Bosmon> Unfortunately I will be out during the daytime here but will be able to help out during her afternoon
2018-09-28T09:53:11 <Bosmon> The good news is that her "reset" functionality pull is pretty much ready so if you have a moment you could experiment integrating with it to see if it raises any issues at your end
2018-09-28T09:53:35 <Bosmon> https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/675
2018-09-28T09:55:33 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: Okay, I will take a look. I guess we can use our fork of `gpii-windows` and make its universal refer to Cindy\'s pull?
2018-09-28T09:55:37 <georgitodorov> Will that work?
2018-09-28T09:55:42 <Bosmon> georgitodorov - yes, should do
2018-09-28T09:55:53 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: Great, thank you
2018-09-28T10:29:19 <jhernandez> dandimitrov: hey there - re your question about GPII-3302, the wix-installer side is ready but not merged yet. Yesterday I updated it with the morphic branding (which is already merged)
2018-09-28T10:33:05 <jhernandez> if you want to test it, you can use this pr (https://github.com/danailbd/gpii-app/pull/41) and then by manually pointing to javihernandez/gpii-wix-installer/GPII-3302 in provisioning/Installer.ps1

2018-09-28T13:10:09 <georgitodorov> cindyli: Hey, Cindy! I have been testing your PR https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/675 against the current state of the PSP/QSS
2018-09-28T13:10:52 <georgitodorov> I see that there is this "defaultSettings.json5" which resides in "%gpii-universal/testData/solutions"
2018-09-28T13:11:29 <georgitodorov> What should I write in this file so that I can control the default values of the QSS settings (e.g. the DPIScale or the language settings)?
2018-09-28T13:12:00 <georgitodorov> Also, is the work on snapshotting the settings of interest to the PSP/QSS done in a separate branch?
2018-09-28T13:12:27 * dandimitrov joined the channel
2018-09-28T13:14:32 <cindyli> georgitodorov: the snapshotting work is half way thru and on hold at the moment because the "reset all" turned out higher priority.  :)

2018-09-28T13:24:48 <georgitodorov> cindyli: Thank you! I will give it a try with that file
2018-09-28T13:24:48 <stegru> jhernandez__, the credentials you need are in: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/0B0EJyC9Yz9S9N3ZZb1U4NE94Tmc
2018-09-28T13:24:49 <cindyli> for each settings, the trick is to set the desired value to settingsHandlers.config.settings.[setting].value
2018-09-28T13:25:04 <cindyli> georgitodorov: ^ thanks for trying it out
2018-09-28T13:25:18 <stegru> cindyli, while you\'re here, can you click on that link and tell me if you can access it?
2018-09-28T13:25:34 <cindyli> i need to request permission to access, stegru
2018-09-28T13:25:37 <stegru> ok good

2018-09-28T13:27:56 <stegru> yes, ok
2018-09-28T13:33:37 <georgitodorov> cindyli: Maybe I am doing something wrong
2018-09-28T13:33:50 <cindyli> doesn\'t work?
2018-09-28T13:34:29 <georgitodorov> I edited the snippet that you sent to me to include only the DPI scale and put the file in "%gpii-universal/testData/solutions" folder
2018-09-28T13:35:15 <georgitodorov> I change the "Read Aloud" setting and hit the "Reset All" button (which I have now changed to make a request to /login for the "reset" token)

2018-09-28T14:25:46 <the-t-in-rtf> Has anyone actually tried using NVDA lately?  I only don\'t see any preference sets in gpii-universal that do anything beyond launching it.
2018-09-28T14:26:24 <the-t-in-rtf> I guess we only exercise them by setting generic terms?
2018-09-28T14:26:24 <jhernandez__> stegru: okay, thanks! will try to test the filebeat thing later
2018-09-28T14:27:26 <jhernandez__> the-t-in-rtf: yes, couple of months ago IIRC
2018-09-28T14:27:47 <jhernandez__> it\'s the same situation with JAWS
2018-09-28T14:27:53 <jhernandez__> we need to update the version
2018-09-28T14:27:53 <the-t-in-rtf> well, it WAS.
2018-09-28T14:27:59 <the-t-in-rtf> I have tested that extensively
2018-09-28T14:28:00 <jhernandez__> right
2018-09-28T14:28:03 <the-t-in-rtf> and updated the version in my pull.
2018-09-28T14:28:16 <the-t-in-rtf> happy to do the same for NVDA, just making sure there wasn\'t useful prior art or anyone else working there.
2018-09-28T14:28:38 * colinclark joined the channel
2018-09-28T14:28:43 <jhernandez__> and we need to check that it actually works, specially after having reworked the iniSettingsHandler
2018-09-28T14:28:57 <the-t-in-rtf> NVDA should be a gentle breeze by comparison, there\'s a chocolatey package for it and everything.
2018-09-28T14:29:11 <the-t-in-rtf> and it won\'t restart the VM every 40 minutes.
2018-09-28T14:29:19 <jhernandez__> exactly
2018-09-28T14:29:43 <jhernandez__> it\'s a matter of taking the time to test with last versions of both nvda and the gpii
2018-09-28T14:30:04 <jhernandez__> and I don\'t think that javjarfer[m] or stegru are actually working on it
2018-09-28T14:30:07 <the-t-in-rtf> yes, blowing away my JAWS testing rig and converting that to test NVDA
2018-09-28T14:30:17 <the-t-in-rtf> I hope not, as I just met with JJ and agreed to do it.
2018-09-28T14:30:19 <the-t-in-rtf> ;)
2018-09-28T14:30:28 <stegru> I\'m not
2018-09-28T14:30:55 <the-t-in-rtf> Great, keep on not working on it, and we\'re good.
2018-09-28T14:31:44 <jhernandez__> but if you are looking for something to onboard and that it\'s a "nice to have", probably you could try taking over this one (https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/606) - if Antranig thinks it\'s worth
2018-09-28T14:32:10 <jhernandez__> I don\'t see him around at this moment though
2018-09-28T14:32:31 <the-t-in-rtf> I\'ll probably start with NVDA, as we have a bunch of data that will let me populate most of the settings in a very short amount of time.
2018-09-28T14:33:00 <the-t-in-rtf> I would have to learn a lot about the PSP to get that far.
2018-09-28T14:34:02 <jhernandez__> the-t-in-rtf: I don\'t think so, AFAIK right now it only follows the language setting, but not sure about the priority of it
2018-09-28T14:34:22 <jhernandez__> but I\'d say it\'s a "nice to have" if possible
2018-09-28T14:34:45 <jhernandez__> just saying :)
2018-09-28T14:35:00 <the-t-in-rtf> I\'ll keep it open for Monday and subscribe to it.

2018-09-28T16:03:03 <Bosmon> Hi there cindyli, dandimitrov - how are things standing with the "reset" implementation?
2018-09-28T16:03:13 <Bosmon> Does it look like it integrates well with the app?
2018-09-28T16:03:24 <cindyli> yes, it works well
2018-09-28T16:03:50 <cindyli> the problem georgi had was caused by a wrong defaultSettings.json5 in the setting dir
2018-09-28T16:03:59 <cindyli> removing it fixed the problem
2018-09-28T16:04:52 <cindyli> Bosmon: thanks for your comments on the "reset" pull request. all addressed. ready for another look
2018-09-28T16:05:18 <cindyli> one sec, CI failed
2018-09-28T16:07:52 <cindyli> from journal test, might be related to GPII-3396
2018-09-28T16:08:30 <jhernandez__> stegru: FYI, I\'ve been playing around with the App/Text Zoom and chrome and it works great
2018-09-28T16:08:36 <jhernandez__> :)
2018-09-28T16:17:57 <jhernandez__> dandimitrov, cindyli: I\'ve just reported https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3415
2018-09-28T16:18:34 <jhernandez__> let me know if it\'s already in your radar or whether we need to take a closer look at it
2018-09-28T16:19:46 <cindyli> jhernandez__: it\'s not, but i probably know why. snapset_2a uses application specific preferences rather than the top level common term. QSS only recognize the top level common term
2018-09-28T16:20:00 <jhernandez__> ah\xc3\xa1
2018-09-28T16:20:18 <jhernandez__> interesting
2018-09-28T16:20:38 <cindyli> if the highcontrast prefs in snapset_2a are changed to
2018-09-28T16:20:51 <cindyli> "http://registry.gpii.net/common/highContrastTheme": "black-white"
2018-09-28T16:20:54 <cindyli> things should work
2018-09-28T16:21:46 <jhernandez__> ok, let me give it a try
2018-09-28T16:40:17 <dandimitrov> jhernandez__: Have you experienced empty folders of GPII after installation :? I created an installer using the GPII-3302 branch of the wix-installer (your repo)  and strangly, after installing it everything was empty :/ I\xe2\x80\x99ll be creating a new one and hopefully it will install successfully
2018-09-28T16:40:56 <jhernandez__> dandimitrov: empty? what do you mean?
2018-09-28T16:42:22 <jhernandez__> honestly, I\'ve tested most of the pieces separated
2018-09-28T16:43:32 <jhernandez__> but I was going to perform an integrated build at some point today - maybe you left one piece behind .. dunno

2018-09-28T16:45:34 <dandimitrov> jhernandez__: I take your substitution :D
2018-09-28T16:46:00 <jhernandez__> xD
2018-09-28T16:46:45 <dandimitrov> Could there be a problem with the HST merge you\xe2\x80\x99ve made :?
2018-09-28T16:47:09 <jhernandez__> okay, have a franken-gpii-app-stein right now, will test it later. Probably the switch to morphic is the reason for such problem
2018-09-28T16:47:30 <dandimitrov> cuz from what I see that the changes for reset shortcut shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a trouble...
2018-09-28T16:47:49 <jhernandez__> nope, the feds-audit only has the changes to set the GPII_CLOUD_URL in start.cmd
2018-09-28T16:48:47 <jhernandez__> so the reset thing shouldn\'t be a problem
