2018-06-22T18:00:30 <sgithens> cindyli the-t-in-rtf: All of our infrastructure is on versions of couch that support mango queries now right? I remember long ago that I think one of your libraries Tony still required an older version of couch?
2018-06-22T18:01:18 <sgithens> and pouch seems to support the bulk of them fine
2018-06-22T18:03:25 <the-t-in-rtf> well.
2018-06-22T18:03:41 <the-t-in-rtf> I still have to do a bit of work for gpii-pouchdb-lucene, so the UL and PTD can be updated.
2018-06-22T18:03:52 <the-t-in-rtf> But AFAIK gpii-pouchdb supports 2.0
2018-06-22T18:04:11 <sgithens> cool
2018-06-22T18:04:17 <the-t-in-rtf> so, if you mean, can you use mango in your projects and test with gpii-pouchdb, I'd say yes.
2018-06-22T18:04:21 <sgithens> sweet
2018-06-22T18:04:41 <the-t-in-rtf> check in with Cindy and others to see if there are better strategies for view management, though.
2018-06-22T18:04:52 <sgithens> those are the sweet words I wanted to hear
2018-06-22T18:04:55 <the-t-in-rtf> you still need indexes for mango, and you'd have to manage those.
2018-06-22T18:05:20 * alanharnum has quit
2018-06-22T18:05:23 <the-t-in-rtf> so you'd either make something that handles index management or extend the view management stuff depending.
2018-06-22T18:05:32 <sgithens> yeah... at some point we might want to use something more sophisticated than the db loader script that shoves in teh views
2018-06-22T18:05:47 * alanharnum joined the channel
2018-06-22T18:06:09 <sgithens> it's a little awkward remembering to cut and paste them back into the db loader script after working them out in fauxton
2018-06-22T18:06:48 <the-t-in-rtf> that's what I do for views.

2018-06-22T18:54:21 <sgithens> the-t-in-rtf I have't looked at all, but do you think there any kind of fauxton/couch plugins that would load views from a file on disk and have a watch task on them so they get reloaded when the files change?
2018-06-22T19:00:06 <the-t-in-rtf> No idea.
2018-06-22T19:00:17 <the-t-in-rtf> My views don't change often enough to worry about it, I was happy with couchapp.
2018-06-22T19:01:22 <the-t-in-rtf> I'm sure you could write a watcher that did the little back and forth of getting the current rev and updating the view.
2018-06-22T19:01:27 <sgithens> well, I've accidentally wiped out my work several times rebuilding docker containers so...
2018-06-22T19:01:34 <sgithens> uh
2018-06-22T19:01:40 <sgithens> actually that's a good idea
2018-06-22T19:01:47 <sgithens> and probably fairly simple to implement
2018-06-22T19:02:00 <the-t-in-rtf> yes, the one I made for you for gpii-handlebars might be an example.
2018-06-22T19:02:02 <the-t-in-rtf> ;)
