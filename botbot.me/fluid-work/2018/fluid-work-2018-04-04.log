2018-04-04T17:01:41 <yuriy> Bosmon7, I forgot to tag you in my previous comment, when you can please, let us know if you will be available for a call tomorrow around 11 - 11:30 AM your time. In general, we have a hard stop around 12:30 your time, but I think it would be helpful for planning even if we had a quick talk.
2018-04-04T17:02:28 <Bosmon7> Hi yuriy - sorry I won't be available in the morning tomorrow, I will be travelling
2018-04-04T17:02:41 <Bosmon7> Perhaps I can answer a few quick questions here?
2018-04-04T17:06:01 * janardan joined the channel
2018-04-04T17:08:09 <yuriy> Bosmon7: Yes, I think we can prepare some questions for tomorrow, and if necessary we can hop on a quick call in the afternoon, even if it\xc2\xb4s just between you and me, because I will probably be available after 4 PM as well.
2018-04-04T17:08:53 * danayo joined the channel
2018-04-04T17:10:24 <Bosmon7> Ok sure that's great
2018-04-04T17:10:30 <Bosmon7> I should be available about 4ish

2018-04-04T19:24:48 <gtirloni> cindyli1: clown's PR was stuck cloning the git repo (retried a few times, broke at 95%), the build timed out at 1 hour now. your PR is running. It looks like a bug in Jenkins, not handling the failure mode with git correctly.... but GitHub is super slow to clone from the IDRC datacenter too (I see our uplink provider, Cogent, is having some network issues again)
