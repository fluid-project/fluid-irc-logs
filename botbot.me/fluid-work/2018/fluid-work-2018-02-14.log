b'2018-02-14T15:16:50 <cindyli> trying agin, Bosmon, i tried with the mock, it worked
2018-02-14T15:17:23 <Bosmon> cindyli - I tried logging in locally with sammy and snapshot_2a, and got no messages
2018-02-14T15:17:28 <Bosmon> How did you test?
2018-02-14T15:19:24 <cindyli> Bosmon: the message i received at running "node browserChannelClient.js"
2018-02-14T15:19:26 <cindyli> ## Socket connected
2018-02-14T15:19:26 <cindyli> ## Received the following message: {"type":"connectionSucceeded"}
2018-02-14T15:19:26 <cindyli> ## Got initial settings  undefined  on connection
2018-02-14T15:19:36 <Bosmon> cindyli - yes
2018-02-14T15:19:38 <Bosmon> You get those
2018-02-14T15:19:45 <Bosmon> But you don\'t get any actual settings when you log on
2018-02-14T15:20:34 <cindyli> no, i think it\'s because the solution "net.gpii.uioPlus" used by this client.js no longer exists
2018-02-14T15:21:41 <Bosmon> But it does: "net.gpii.uioPlus"
2018-02-14T15:21:48 <Bosmon> I see the settings for it in the session
2018-02-14T15:21:58 <cindyli> Bosmon: steps i tested:
2018-02-14T15:22:03 <cindyli> 1. in one terminal, run "node gpii.js gpii/configs/mocks gpii.config.development.all.local.mock.windows
2018-02-14T15:22:08 <Bosmon> It\'s just they are not transmitted, I think because the settings handler with this config has been replaced by a mock
2018-02-14T15:23:05 <cindyli> i don\'t have idea about "the settings handler with this config"
2018-02-14T15:23:52 <Bosmon> cindyli - the example client doesn\'t work
2018-02-14T15:24:02 <Bosmon> Because it doesn\'t receive any settings that are meant for it when the user logs on
2018-02-14T15:24:31 <Bosmon> For example, when connecting to http://localhost:8081/user/snapset_2a/login there should be a onSettingsChanged message
2018-02-14T15:24:33 <Bosmon> But there isn\'t
2018-02-14T15:25:12 <Bosmon> I believe the reason for this is that using the config I suggested, "gpii.config.development.all.local.mock.windows", all of the settingsHandlers, including the webSockets one, have been replaced by mocks
2018-02-14T15:26:17 <cindyli> Bosmon: this is the message with "node gpii.js gpii/configs gpii.config.development.all.local":
2018-02-14T15:26:25 <cindyli> ## Socket connected
2018-02-14T15:26:25 <cindyli> ## Received the following message: {"isError":true,"message":"Rejecting a connection request from \'net.gpii.uioPlus\'. The solution id was not found in the solutions registry"}
2018-02-14T15:27:03 <cindyli> does it mean the settings handler for this solution needs to be added either way?
2018-02-14T15:27:32 <cindyli> or change to another solution that exists in the solutions registry
2018-02-14T15:27:42 <Bosmon> cindyli - the solution is definitely there: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L3110

2018-02-14T15:35:03 <Bosmon> Thanks, cindyli
2018-02-14T15:35:12 <cindyli> ok

2018-02-14T16:45:03 <jhung> clown: Regarding the combo box work, is that available somewhere to look at? Combo boxes have recently come up in discussions with PhET.
2018-02-14T16:47:09 <clown> jhung, we were looking at the metrolinx\'s development site on Lisa\'s machine, so I don\'t have the url immediately at hand.  Lisa is away today \xe2\x80\x94 wait until she is back tomorrow (I think)?
2018-02-14T16:51:18 <jhung> clown: ok. I often find myself in discussions involving HTML / Aria grey areas like this where there are multiple approaches and no best practice. It\'s nice to have something I can point to as a good reference (sort of like the <details><summary> approach you helped with for fig captions).
2018-02-14T16:52:33 <clown> jhung, glad I could be of help, but \xe2\x80\xa6
2018-02-14T16:53:30 <clown> with the metrolinx site, Lisa made sure she was following the aria best practices advice for comboboxes with some relatively difficult markup, and it doesn\'t appear to work (with VoiceOver).
2018-02-14T16:54:09 <clown> this might turn out to be a bug in Safari, VoiceOver, or both.
2018-02-14T16:57:47 <jhung> clown: Ah, I understand now. Although I find myself in situations like that too where it\'s clear what the approach should be, but the technology behaves in an unexpected way.

2018-02-14T17:42:40 <Sunny0794> yeah....I am exploring different project idea...and this seems interesting.....Can you get me started with any beginner issues on which I can work to get me comfortable with code.
2018-02-14T17:43:43 <Sunny0794> I am fluent with html,css,javascript,.MEAN stack..it\'s various frameworks..and excited to learn new technologies
2018-02-14T17:47:08 <Sunny0794> As I can see it\'s main objective is to come up with possible workflows and prototypes that facilitate the creation, editing, and printing of the Inclusive Design Guide from a web copy.

2018-02-14T18:05:45 <Sunny0794> Hello paras!! Welcome to the community!
2018-02-14T18:09:22 <paras7735> Hi i am interested in contributing code to Fluid Infusion but i can not figure out where to start. Can you help me.
2018-02-14T18:10:41 <Sunny0794> danayo  -  Sir, According to time difference is this the right time for conversation, or I can connect after some time......!
2018-02-14T18:11:53 <Sunny0794> Hey Paras..you can look at wiki pages https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Google+Summer+of+Code+2018+with+the+Fluid+Project#space-menu-link-content.....It will help you to get started.....I am also new and trying to learn more.
2018-02-14T18:13:32 <paras7735> Thanks!
2018-02-14T18:16:18 <alanharnum> welcome paras7735 - one good starting point is the introductory tutorial at https://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/tutorial-developerIntroduction/DeveloperIntroductionToInfusionFramework-OpeningRemarks.html
2018-02-14T18:16:34 <alanharnum> this goes over the basics of the framework and has interactive code via CodePen

2018-02-14T18:50:03 <kasparnet> hi bosmon
2018-02-14T18:50:10 <kasparnet> I did a bit more triaging of GPII-2842
2018-02-14T18:50:19 <kasparnet> and added the info to this: https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2842
2018-02-14T18:50:42 <kasparnet> It complains when attempting to create a new instance of the lifecycle manager
2018-02-14T18:51:31 <Bosmon> kasparnet - very interesting
2018-02-14T18:51:39 <kasparnet> not sure if this has to do with creating a component in a perhaps not-so-IoC\'ish way - and why things would suddenly explode with the new infusion
2018-02-14T18:51:58 <kasparnet> I can continue to try and triage it further
2018-02-14T18:52:08 <Bosmon> kasparnet - what\'s not so IOCish about it?
2018-02-14T18:52:17 <Bosmon> And how does this relate to the mouseTrailing material being missing?
2018-02-14T18:52:37 <kasparnet> mousetrailing thing is a different issue (see my first comment in JIRA)
2018-02-14T18:52:47 <kasparnet> and an easily fixable one
2018-02-14T18:52:50 <Sunny0794> yes danayo sir, i was exploring that tutorial....it\'s a great starting material
2018-02-14T18:54:14 <Bosmon> kasparnet - oh that\'s great
2018-02-14T18:54:19 <Bosmon> If you can do that bit, I\'ll look at the other bit
2018-02-14T18:54:33 <kasparnet> that\'d be perfect!! Cheers
2018-02-14T18:59:59 <paras7735> I wanted to ask how do i view any changes i did in my local copy on the browser?
2018-02-14T19:00:22 <paras7735> Do i build it? if yes then what is the command?
2018-02-14T19:01:12 <kasparnet> Bosmon, btw, all other tests are passing, so it\'s only that one case of creating the lifecyclemanager that fails
2018-02-14T19:03:10 <Bosmon> kasparnet - ok, I see
2018-02-14T19:04:31 <Bosmon> Any idea where the reference is from?
2018-02-14T19:05:05 <kasparnet> the lifecycle manager reference?
2018-02-14T19:05:08 <Bosmon> yes
2018-02-14T19:05:21 <kasparnet> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/eventLog/test/EventLogTests.js#L59
2018-02-14T19:05:28 <kasparnet> this is where it is created
2018-02-14T19:05:31 <Bosmon> Yes
2018-02-14T19:05:31 <kasparnet> as far as I can tell
2018-02-14T19:05:37 <Bosmon> But where is the reference written that fails to resolve
2018-02-14T19:05:53 <kasparnet> ah, sec
2018-02-14T19:06:27 <Bosmon> Ah, it\'s in the eventLog component itself
2018-02-14T19:07:57 <Bosmon> Well, the construction is certainly a bit sleazy but I can\'t see any great reason why this shouldn\'t resolve
2018-02-14T19:08:06 <Bosmon> It may be a newly introduced Infusion bug
2018-02-14T19:08:28 <kasparnet> yeah, or at least everything was passing before the update
2018-02-14T19:08:47 * stegru has quit
2018-02-14T19:08:51 <alanharnum> paras7735: if you want to make a new build of Infusion, there\'s details here: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion#package-types - generally when developing locally you can just run a local web server from the project root and access the test files
2018-02-14T19:09:30 * cindyli joined the channel
2018-02-14T19:09:45 <alanharnum> paras7735: if you\'re looking to experiment you can also pull precompiled full builds off https://cdnjs.com/libraries/infusion or https://unpkg.com/infusion@2.0.0/dist/
2018-02-14T19:12:32 <Bosmon> kasparnet - but is what the-t-in-rtf says in his original report still right? That if you just update infusion to latest you only get the MT bug?
2018-02-14T19:12:37 <Bosmon> Or do you get the eventLog bug as well?
2018-02-14T19:13:26 <kasparnet> I checked out master of universal, updated the package.json to point to the latest infusion and ran the tests
2018-02-14T19:13:31 <kasparnet> and got both of the errors
2018-02-14T19:13:48 <kasparnet> consistently
2018-02-14T19:14:01 <Bosmon> kasparnet - ok, great
2018-02-14T19:14:31 <kasparnet> i didn\'t upgrade node-jqunit
2018-02-14T19:14:38 <kasparnet> or anything else

2018-02-14T08:47:58 <kasparnet> bosmon: morning bosmann
2018-02-14T08:53:13 <kasparnet> so another issue came to mind when working on moving the capabilities around... So far we\'ve assumed that the */enabled terms will dictate the run state of an application (that is, the active flag of the matchmaker), but this is not always true
2018-02-14T08:54:24 <kasparnet> while it IS true for solutions like the windows magnifier, it is not true for an application that supports BOTH magnification and screenreading. In that case, it should be possible to turn on off and not the other - which makes sense to do via the enabled flags
2018-02-14T08:56:56 <kasparnet> so given the case of supernova (which both suppports magnification and screenreading), magnification/enabled: false, would mean that we should set whatever setting the magnification/enabled translates into to false
2018-02-14T08:57:23 <kasparnet> whereas with the windows magnifier, a magnification/enabled: false would mean we should kill the magnifier
2018-02-14T08:58:42 <kasparnet> I guess one way of handling this would be to take advantage of what we decided yesterday - that if e.g. the "magnification/enabled is listed in the top level capabilities, then it means it can only be turned off by stopping the application
2018-02-14T08:59:25 <kasparnet> whereas if it\'s not there (and hence in the capabilitiesTransformation block), it means that there is a corresponding setting in the application to turn it off and there is no need to stop the application
2018-02-14T08:59:43 <kasparnet> could you give me a sanity check on that suggestion?

2018-02-14T13:28:31 <Bosmon> Hey kasparnet
2018-02-14T13:28:49 <kasparnet> bang!!!! Mega speed pong
2018-02-14T13:29:04 <Bosmon> Yes, it is an interesting point that disabling a feature need not correspond to killing an application
2018-02-14T13:29:15 <Bosmon> Which is just the kind of observation that suggests we will not survive after you are gone
2018-02-14T13:30:17 <kasparnet> hehe, well hopefully it wont be that bad
2018-02-14T13:30:30 <kasparnet> but yeah, it\'s interesting and a bit annoying
2018-02-14T13:30:42 <kasparnet> ... or at least less clean than we had hoped for

2018-02-14T13:45:22 <yuriy__> Bosmon: Hi, Antranig! I have a hopefully quick follow-up question on the error dialogs. You mentioned something about how error dialogs eventually need to be sequential. Is this something that you think we can start work on?
2018-02-14T13:48:56 <Bosmon> yuriy__ - yes, you can start
2018-02-14T13:49:07 <Bosmon> I have circulated the idea to Gregg and received no objection
2018-02-14T13:50:11 * jhung joined the channel
2018-02-14T13:50:18 <Bosmon> What are your thoughts on the testability of the webView scripts?

2018-02-14T13:53:08 * cindyli joined the channel
2018-02-14T13:53:45 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: We are currently working actively on this. I think we can go without a mock HTTP server - for the purposes of the tests we will have a different html page which will reside on the file system and will be loaded in the webview. This page will contain the components of interest - a break-out link, a close button and an element for the end of the survey.
2018-02-14T13:54:19 <Bosmon> georgitodorov - cool, that sounds reasonable
2018-02-14T13:54:22 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: The webview can execute JavaScript which is passed as a string
2018-02-14T13:54:23 <Bosmon> You\'ll use a file:/// URL?
2018-02-14T13:55:10 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: Actually, I am using fluid.module.resolvePath("%gpii-app/testData/...") as the URL in this case
2018-02-14T13:55:20 <georgitodorov> But a file:// URL should also do the trick
2018-02-14T13:55:33 <Bosmon> Ah ok - so the content will be loaded programmatically somehow?
2018-02-14T13:55:44 <Bosmon> Via a node API?
2018-02-14T13:56:43 <georgitodorov> Well, it appears that the webview can load webpages from html files on the file system without the need for anything else but specifying the proper src
2018-02-14T13:57:37 <georgitodorov> We\'ll use a mock survey payload which will contain a url to a file in the testData folder
2018-02-14T13:57:57 <georgitodorov> Then the dialogManager will show it when needed
2018-02-14T13:58:33 <georgitodorov> Bosomon: I don\'t know if I managed to answer your question :)
2018-02-14T14:01:01 <Bosmon> georgitodorov, no sounds reasonable
2018-02-14T14:01:15 <Bosmon> But somehow the src URLs don\'t need a protocol prefix or what?
2018-02-14T14:01:28 * colinclark joined the channel
2018-02-14T14:04:03 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: They do as the value of the src attribute is a URL. I guess that electron automatically adds the file:// prefix whenever it determines that a local file is to be loaded

2018-02-14T14:06:55 <Bosmon> ok, it\'s always funny to see these little holes ...

2018-02-14T14:24:20 <kasparnet> anything holding us back from referencing a newer infusion release from universal?

2018-02-14T14:24:41 <Bosmon> kasparnet - yes
2018-02-14T14:24:47 <kasparnet> damn
2018-02-14T14:24:51 <Bosmon> I think some kind of model transformation bug :)
2018-02-14T14:24:56 <Bosmon> It would be great if you could look into it : P
2018-02-14T14:25:04 <kasparnet> yeah, I\'d be happy to
2018-02-14T14:25:11 <Bosmon> Really awesome
2018-02-14T14:25:13 <kasparnet> do you have a JIRA number?
2018-02-14T14:25:21 <Bosmon> It\'s something the-t-in-rtf saw
2018-02-14T14:25:24 <Bosmon> I can\'t remember if he filed
2018-02-14T14:27:46 <the-t-in-rtf> @Bosmon, I\'ve found so many funny things over the years, it would help if you could refresh my memory a little.
2018-02-14T14:28:05 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - some kind of test failure on updating universal to latest infusion
2018-02-14T14:28:10 <Bosmon> Within about the last week or so
2018-02-14T14:28:15 <the-t-in-rtf> great, I\'ll take a look.
2018-02-14T14:28:31 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - no, just wondering whether you had it to mind immediately
2018-02-14T14:28:37 <Bosmon> Since I think kasparnet is investigating now
2018-02-14T14:28:58 <Bosmon> Since I\'ve been travelling my memory is a bit vague, but I remembered someone (possibly you) referring to this .....
2018-02-14T14:29:44 <Bosmon> Looks like this one: https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2842
2018-02-14T14:30:32 <the-t-in-rtf> Oh, right.
2018-02-14T14:30:45 <the-t-in-rtf> I focused on the bit about a model transformation bug and thought the two were related.
2018-02-14T14:31:01 <Bosmon> I assume it is causing the first part
2018-02-14T14:31:08 <Bosmon> But it\'s true it could be anything
2018-02-14T14:33:47 <Bosmon> kasparnet - I\'m just merging your liveness pull https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/567 for GPII-631
2018-02-14T14:33:53 <Bosmon> Hope this is ok
2018-02-14T14:34:54 <kasparnet> yay, that\'s great! Thanks Bosmon
2018-02-14T14:35:30 <kasparnet> Bosmon and the-t-in-rtf - I\'ll take a look at GPII-2842 (and any other issues relating to updating infusion) since I need some of the functionality for my big MM pull
2018-02-14T14:39:26 <the-t-in-rtf> @bosmon (or anyone) can you give me a sentence that describes what npOptions does here? https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/core/js/DataBinding.js#L640
2018-02-14T14:39:50 <the-t-in-rtf> I\'ve got rid of most of the false positives and am finding the real problems, undocumented parameters, et cetera.

2018-02-14T14:42:18 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - yes, the same
2018-02-14T14:42:21 <kasparnet> the-t-in-rtf, Bosmon: is there a list of infusion dev releases somewhere or how does it work?
2018-02-14T14:42:36 <kasparnet> if I want to avoid referencing github hash
2018-02-14T14:42:38 <Bosmon> kasparnet - well I guess we just use npm view ....
2018-02-14T14:42:59 <the-t-in-rtf> Great, thanks.
2018-02-14T14:43:40 <Bosmon> Says the most recent is the one I rolled for the-t-in-rtf last week, 3.0.0-dev.20180208T114206Z.2964703
2018-02-14T14:44:11 <kasparnet> ah, fancy
2018-02-14T14:44:23 <kasparnet> didn\'t know about that command! thanks Bosmon

2018-02-14T15:14:36 <Bosmon> Hi there cindyli, I was just looking at your pull https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/586
2018-02-14T15:14:51 <Bosmon> I find now that when I try to use the suggested config, the client receives no messages ....
2018-02-14T15:15:08 <Bosmon> Which I assume is because all the settingsHandlers, including the browserChannel one, have been replaced by mocks....

2018-02-14T15:15:53 <Bosmon> cindyli yes
2018-02-14T15:16:04 <cindyli> did you try with the mock config file
2018-02-14T15:16:07 <Bosmon> cindyli yes
2018-02-14T15:16:09 <mrtyler> cindyli: i\'m ready but i\'ll let you finish up with Bosmon
2018-02-14T15:16:18 <Bosmon> The example client now receives no messages
2018-02-14T15:16:25 <cindyli> thanks, mrtyler.
2018-02-14T15:16:34 <Bosmon> I\'m sorry, it was my suggestion originally, but now I see it was a silly one
