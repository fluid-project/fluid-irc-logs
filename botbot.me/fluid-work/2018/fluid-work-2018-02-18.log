2018-02-18T07:51:40 <Victor____> Cindy, I have been able to successfully install achecker on
2018-02-18T07:52:12 <Victor____> using PHP 5.6 and it was successful
2018-02-18T07:54:32 <Victor____> But the problem, now is that for the other part, which I am trying to upgrade in other for it to be functional with php 7.0, I was able to make all the installation processes to be successful up to step 7,except that now when it is now redirected to the home index.php page, an error 500 do occur
2018-02-18T07:55:32 <Victor____> Do check my last commits, still on that previous pull request
2018-02-18T07:56:36 <Victor____> Maybe, I am getting something wrong, but the installation do end being successful, probably the other error is from the index page

2018-02-18T18:21:39 <Victor_20> cindly, after doing some checks,  I discovered the HTTP 500 error, is from the index.php(and probably other files included in it)... so for now the installation is good to go for both 5.6 and 7.0
2018-02-18T18:22:26 <Victor_20> so, my next step is to work on the home page and do some refactoring
