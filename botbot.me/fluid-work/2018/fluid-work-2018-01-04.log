2018-01-04T11:40:12 <javjarfer[m]> really crazy stuff, all CPU in market are susceptible to attacks...

2018-01-04T13:08:43 <gtirloni> fluid-work: updated packages for our servers are available to try and mitigate the latest CPU security issues that were discovered. I'm applying them now and will need to reboot the IDRC servers afterwards. sorry for the short notice. please avoid using our services until the maintenance in completed.

2018-01-04T13:37:08 <javjarfer[m]> stegru: wow, nice progress there, I see that you have decided keeping it isolated
2018-01-04T13:37:43 <stegru> had to be, because it has to be 64-bit
2018-01-04T13:39:12 <javjarfer[m]> nice, well, in that case this is the best approach for know for sure
2018-01-04T13:39:26 <javjarfer[m]> and btw Intel approves software isolation too

2018-01-04T15:19:17 <Justin_o> simonjb: I was talking with michelled yesterday, we're wondering if you'd be interested in leading a community meeting about https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/An+Infusion+Pattern+Language
2018-01-04T15:21:15 <simonjb> Justin_o: sure, that page is still pretty rough, but I'd be happy to talk about it
2018-01-04T15:21:30 <Justin_o> simonjb: great thanks :)
2018-01-04T15:21:58 <simonjb> Justin_o: when were you thinking?
2018-01-04T15:21:59 <Justin_o> simonjb: the Jan 24 meeting just opened up, would you like to do it then, or would you prefer some time in February?
2018-01-04T15:23:46 <simonjb> Justin_o, michelled: what were you thinking in terms of content? scoped to Infusion-specific patterns or also some background on patterns more generally?
2018-01-04T15:25:35 <Justin_o> I guess some background to start might be a good idea, just to sort of set the space i guess...
2018-01-04T15:27:02 <michelled> that sounds good to me
2018-01-04T15:27:07 <simonjb> Justin_o: cool, I could do Jan 24
2018-01-04T15:27:10 <michelled> and hopefully Bosmon3 and join us for that
2018-01-04T15:27:25 <michelled> can join us
2018-01-04T15:28:37 <Justin_o> simonjb: great, thanks
2018-01-04T15:31:09 <simonjb> thanks Justin_o and michelled, it'll be fun I think
2018-01-04T15:31:27 <simonjb> have we talked much about patterns at IDRC in the past?
2018-01-04T15:32:03 <Justin_o> hmm.. i'm not sure.. i feel like we probably did talk about some things, but can't think of any thing in particular
2018-01-04T15:32:24 <simonjb> ok, cool, just wondering about background
2018-01-04T15:32:59 * danayo joined the channel
2018-01-04T15:33:55 <Justin_o> simonjb: right, sorry, can't help much, but i guess if there's time it wouldn't hurt to start from the basics
2018-01-04T15:34:15 <simonjb> Justin_o: yes, totally
2018-01-04T15:34:53 <Justin_o> i think the wiki page and perhaps what you talk about at the community meeting will be useful for GSoC students and others joining the IDRC
2018-01-04T15:35:21 <Justin_o> or even others starting to use infusion
2018-01-04T15:36:48 <simonjb> Justin_o: I can make some slides or other artifact for the meeting and that may be something that's useful to have as reference

2018-01-04T15:37:45 <michelled> simonjb: I feel like the last time we talked much about patterns was at UofT before you left
2018-01-04T15:37:53 <michelled> so it's high time for another conversation :)
2018-01-04T15:38:15 <Justin_o> simonjb: thanks that sounds great

2018-01-04T16:27:44 <grrrero> When you get a chance :)
2018-01-04T16:29:07 <danayo> for sure grrrero, I'll sketch something up quick this morning and ping you
2018-01-04T16:29:13 <grrrero> Awesome thanks danayo!!

2018-01-04T17:02:54 <gloob> is it supossed that they add some protection in precious high sierra patches grrrero
2018-01-04T17:03:11 <gloob> as far as I read
2018-01-04T17:03:26 <grrrero> Ah I see thanks ussjoin and gloob
2018-01-04T17:04:11 <ussjoin> When I see more on OSX, I'll try to remember to post in here. (If you see more before I do, please post in here so I see it, too; all my stuff is OSX and this bug fills me with sadness. :-) )
2018-01-04T17:04:19 <grrrero> For sure ussjoin
2018-01-04T17:04:57 <gloob> well, from snowden you should accept that you are under inspection
2018-01-04T17:05:04 <ussjoin> https://medium.com/@pwnallthethings/time-travelling-exploits-with-meltdown-1189548f1e1d -- this is a pretty medium-tech writeup. (So if you code, you want more than the NYTimes but unless you're deeply, shockingly technical, maybe less than the P0 writeup; this is a decent middle.)
