2018-02-26T10:32:52 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: Hey, Antranig! We fixed the settings broker tests and pushed the changes. It turns out that the problem was not the two listeners back to back in the sequence.
2018-02-26T10:33:26 <georgitodorov> Or, maybe this was the problem but the fix was to actually wait for a model changed event on a different component (on the app instead of on the settings broker)
2018-02-26T10:34:19 <georgitodorov> This made the tests pass. Also, it turned out that previously the last two elements in the test sequence were executed twice (i.e. some component may not have been destroyed or may have been created again mysteriously)
2018-02-26T10:34:46 <georgitodorov> Anyway, if you think that the PR is now in good shape, you can merge it into master.
2018-02-26T11:40:45 <Bosmon> OK, thanks georgitodorov - I\'ll rerun the tess here now
2018-02-26T11:40:47 <Bosmon> tests
2018-02-26T12:05:57 <Bosmon> jhernandez - wow, well done VVANTTUNNEZZ!
2018-02-26T12:06:06 <Bosmon> Pull for electron 1.8.1 woohoo
2018-02-26T12:06:45 <jhernandez> Bosmon: heh, let\'s see if it passes CI - it does here ... :)
2018-02-26T12:06:48 <jhernandez> and yes
2018-02-26T12:06:58 <jhernandez> I\'ve finally decided to go to 1.8.1
2018-02-26T12:07:05 <Bosmon> jhernandez - just about to merge georgitodorov \'s big pull for the surveys
2018-02-26T12:08:46 <jhernandez> Bosmon: cool, go ahead, I can update mine afterwards
2018-02-26T12:09:59 <jhernandez> in any case, I have to come back to the windows one before, the creation of the installer was failing

2018-02-26T12:46:33 <Bosmon> jhernandez - rather peculiar failure
2018-02-26T12:46:38 <Bosmon> I can\'t immediately see what the cause is
2018-02-26T12:46:56 <Bosmon> Oh no wait there it is
2018-02-26T12:47:05 <Bosmon> It\'s just an "Object has been destroyed" in the middle
2018-02-26T12:50:03 <Bosmon> Very easy to fix
2018-02-26T12:50:04 <Bosmon> https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/blob/8f9bdc247e883359228fd3340d80e4260daf71a8/src/main/psp.js#L180
2018-02-26T12:50:25 <Bosmon> jhernandez - I suggest what is done here is rather than adding a raw listener, instead to relay the raw electron event to an Infusion event onDisplayMetricsChanged
2018-02-26T12:50:32 <Bosmon> And then position the code below as a listener
2018-02-26T12:50:49 <Bosmon> This will then ensure that everything is neutered when the app is torn down
2018-02-26T12:51:42 <Bosmon> Should really do the same with the blur listener too

2018-02-26T14:11:15 <Justin_o> Bosmon: could you explain this comment some more.. i\'m not sure what you mean about the more elaborate namespace. https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/867#discussion_r166663906
2018-02-26T14:11:45 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I was just wondering whether it made sense to roll these all into the same event, and just add more priority constraints
2018-02-26T14:14:04 <jhernandez> Bosmon: okay, I\'ll update the pull request with that little fix after my "doggie" break
2018-02-26T14:14:23 <jhernandez> thanks a lot for the tip!
2018-02-26T14:18:01 * michelled joined the channel
2018-02-26T14:19:16 <Justin_o> Bosmon: so a couple things I\'m confused about is that you mention onFetch/afterFetch errors but there is only onFetchError event.. do you mean the regular onFetch/afterFetch onWrite/afterWrite events? Also, if that is the case and we just have an onWrite and onFetch event i\'m not sure how to break up the functionality for sequencing that is in the fetch and write implementation.

2018-02-26T14:20:48 * michelled has quit
2018-02-26T14:20:51 <Bosmon> Which suggested to me it may make sense to keep the events separate for now
2018-02-26T14:21:03 <Bosmon> But I was just making sure that we evaluated this alternative design
2018-02-26T14:21:23 * amatas joined the channel
2018-02-26T14:21:51 <Justin_o> Bosmon: ah okay.. i know i tried a bunch of different things when writing this before.. but can\'t remember all the variations any more :(
2018-02-26T14:24:01 <Justin_o> Bosmon: I suppose there might be a way to structure it as part of the event sequence for onWrite and onFetch.. i can explore that a bit more
2018-02-26T14:25:27 <Bosmon> I think the current design works, it\'s just I\'m growing a little suspicious of "linked events"
2018-02-26T14:25:43 <Bosmon> Since there is no clear way to associate a particular firing of one event to a particular firing of another one, when looking from the outside
2018-02-26T14:33:12 * simonjb joined the channel
2018-02-26T14:36:38 <Justin_o> Bosmon: that\'s very true.. so do you think i should leave it as is for now?
2018-02-26T14:37:15 <Bosmon> Justin_o - well, that\'s my feeling, but what do you think?
2018-02-26T14:37:21 <Bosmon> You\'re closer to the design at present
2018-02-26T14:38:32 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i guess so, but the works been spread out enough that I keep forgetting what I\'ve done :( I\'ll try to spend some time this morning investigating the alternative approach and if that doesn\'t yield any results I\'ll leave it as is.
2018-02-26T14:38:41 <Bosmon> Justin_o - awesome, thanks
2018-02-26T14:38:48 <Justin_o> Bosmon: also, what do you think we should do about https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6249?focusedCommentId=38835&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-38835
2018-02-26T14:38:58 <Justin_o> in relation to FLUID-6209
2018-02-26T14:48:13 <Bosmon> Justin_o - it\'s a little hard to follow
2018-02-26T14:48:19 <Bosmon> "This is even the case if the modelListener for saving the panelIndex is set to exclude init. It seems that this is happening because the initial model values are also being set in the model which triggers a save."
2018-02-26T14:48:23 <Bosmon> What is the connection here?
2018-02-26T14:48:57 <Justin_o> initial model values are the defaults for the preferences
2018-02-26T14:49:29 <Bosmon> So why does this trigger a save?
2018-02-26T14:49:31 <Justin_o> I\'m assuming that because these are applied to the model, it is triggering an auto save
2018-02-26T14:49:46 <Bosmon> But you say that you have set "exclude init"
2018-02-26T14:50:02 <Justin_o> exclude init for the panelIndex
2018-02-26T14:50:11 <Justin_o> which is part of the components state and not a preference
2018-02-26T14:50:46 <Justin_o> that is the model would look something like this {panelIndex: 0, preferences: {contrast: "default"}}
2018-02-26T14:51:13 <Justin_o> but the prefs framework will strip out the default values for preferences before saving them to the store
2018-02-26T14:51:21 <Bosmon> Ah ok
2018-02-26T14:51:32 <Bosmon> Could you flesh out the explanation with that detail?
2018-02-26T14:51:42 <Bosmon> That is that the model is in two parts, etc.
2018-02-26T14:52:02 <Justin_o> will do..

2018-02-26T15:41:10 <cindyli> amatas, amatas[m], how can i trigger the CI for this pull request to re-run? the CI fails at running node tests that i cannot re-produce with my local VM so thinking to re-run the CI. it seems commenting with "ok to test" doesn\'t help
2018-02-26T15:41:28 <cindyli> https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/591
2018-02-26T15:45:49 <cindyli> amatas, amatas, never mind. "ok to test" works, just a little delay ;)
2018-02-26T16:06:08 <simonjb> Justin_o, cindyli, and others: Do we have any Fluid code anywhere for sending HTTP requests that would work both in Node.js and in browser? I looked but didn\'t see anything. Before I implement my own HTTP request grade I wanted to check if such a thing exists?
2018-02-26T16:07:03 <cindyli> simonjb: the same code that works in both?
2018-02-26T16:07:19 <simonjb> or, an API that works in both
2018-02-26T16:07:39 <simonjb> a common API I can program to that will work in both environments
2018-02-26T16:08:02 <simonjb> I can write my own layer but wanted to check if we had own already
