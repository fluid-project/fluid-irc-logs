b'2018-10-18T15:47:51 <simonjb> I\'m figuring out priorities
2018-10-18T15:50:13 <Bosmon> simonjb - not vastly urgent, but moderately
2018-10-18T15:50:22 <Bosmon> It will eventually block work on being able to deploy the GPII cloud securely
2018-10-18T15:51:00 <simonjb> ok, thanks Bosmon
2018-10-18T15:51:29 * dandimitrov has quit
2018-10-18T16:24:42 <jhernandez> stegru, Bosmon: I\'ve been playing around with the installer for some time and I could spot a few issues
2018-10-18T16:24:48 <jhernandez> cindyli: ^
2018-10-18T16:25:29 <jhernandez> can you take a look at them? https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dt-ak2HrNG9eiCkVlIMYa9SFk9-n5huOZzzdz7qTibc/edit#
2018-10-18T16:27:02 <jhernandez> IMO and in general, the system is working very well, it\'s consistent, no crashes ... I wouldn\'t say these are blockers at this moment
2018-10-18T16:27:15 <jhernandez> but just wanted a second opinion from you
2018-10-18T16:27:24 <cindyli> jhernandez: J1 and J2 are probably because "noUser" is keyed in
2018-10-18T16:27:43 <Bosmon> Cheers jhernandez - what do you mean by " to indicate a high contrast theme in the standard configuration" ?
2018-10-18T16:28:21 <jhernandez> Bosmon: it\'s about indicating the standard value for windows high contrast theme within the defaultSettings.json5 file
2018-10-18T16:28:56 <jhernandez> I don\'t think that a public machine will use a windows highcontrast theme by default
2018-10-18T16:29:02 <cindyli> Bosmon: Shall there be special handling for "noUser" for J1 and J2
2018-10-18T16:29:53 <jhernandez> cindyli: about J1, I\'d say it\'s gpii-app\'s fault
2018-10-18T16:30:43 <cindyli> ok
2018-10-18T16:31:06 <Bosmon> Yes, it is gpii-app\'s responsibility to understand the meaning of noUser
2018-10-18T16:32:15 <Bosmon> jhernandez - but I imagine we can actually do J3, right, it\'s just that the file format is very complicated?
2018-10-18T16:33:33 <Bosmon> J2 seems like some race condition in notifications - see if you can get a sequence logged of what goes over the PSPChannel in this situation
2018-10-18T16:33:50 <jhernandez> yeah, we can definetly provide the block for the windows highContrast theme, but I don\'t see a person who is not a tekkie updating such file by hand
2018-10-18T16:34:36 <jhernandez> and also, I\'m not sure whether it\'s going to uncover any problem by providing such block, not sure - would have to test it
2018-10-18T16:52:08 <jhernandez> cindyli, Bosmon: okay, updated some info on J2
2018-10-18T16:56:37 <jhernandez> it\'s worst than I thought initially :/
2018-10-18T16:58:42 <jhernandez> mostly, because the first time you key in, although the system gets configured, you aren\'t keyed-in for the QSS/PSP, so can change the settings but can\'t save them
2018-10-18T16:59:07 * natarajaya joined the channel
2018-10-18T17:02:34 <cindyli> jhernandez: i will try to reproduce the issue and see if there\'s anything wrong in the universal code. shall i use gpii-app ajc3 branch?
2018-10-18T17:06:25 <jhernandez> cindyli: yes, ajc3 branch is the one you should use
2018-10-18T17:06:32 <cindyli> ok
2018-10-18T17:06:54 <jhernandez> also, you can use the installer, I\'ve put it into the same folder as the doc I\'ve shared with you

2018-10-18T17:09:33 <cindyli> ok. thanks
2018-10-18T17:14:28 <jhernandez> sorry guys, I have to leave now

2018-10-18T10:56:30 <jhernandez> :)
2018-10-18T10:56:31 <jhernandez> shipping it now
2018-10-18T10:56:44 <stegru> well done
2018-10-18T10:57:34 <stegru> oh the technique used for the single process thing will be removed in a later version of electron
2018-10-18T10:57:58 <stegru> I mean "replaced", not removed
2018-10-18T10:58:10 <jhernandez> mmh
2018-10-18T10:58:12 <jhernandez> interesting
2018-10-18T10:58:20 <jhernandez> later you mean 3.x series?
2018-10-18T10:58:45 <jhernandez> or did it happen already?
2018-10-18T10:59:54 <jhernandez> stegru: btw, now I can\'t CTRL+C when I run the gpii from the console to stop the app ... is it happening the same to you?
2018-10-18T11:00:02 <stegru> it\'s later
2018-10-18T11:00:06 <jhernandez> ok
2018-10-18T11:00:19 <stegru> I think so, try ctrl+break instead
2018-10-18T11:00:41 <stegru> sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn\'t
2018-10-18T11:01:31 <jhernandez> yeah
2018-10-18T11:01:35 <jhernandez> that\'s what I observed
2018-10-18T11:02:02 * dandimitrov has quit
2018-10-18T11:02:58 <the-t-in-rtf> ctrl+break would be a great DJ name
2018-10-18T11:03:34 <jhernandez> xDDD
2018-10-18T11:03:59 <stegru> much better than "the-t-in-rtf"
2018-10-18T11:05:17 <the-t-in-rtf> or "notorious S.T.E.G.R.U"
2018-10-18T11:05:29 <stegru> ha
2018-10-18T11:05:38 <stegru> it\'s been a while since I\'ve used that ;)

2018-10-18T11:07:52 <stegru> haha
2018-10-18T11:09:04 <the-t-in-rtf> that\'s awesome.  contrary to what  Dr. Seuss led us to believe, I have a hard time believing cats like hats at all.
2018-10-18T11:09:14 <the-t-in-rtf> they must have stitched it to the shirt to keep it in place.
2018-10-18T11:14:18 <stegru> you\'ve obviously tried this
2018-10-18T11:19:39 <jhernandez> stegru: try what? stitching a hat to a t-shirt? I\'m sure of it :P :P

2018-10-18T11:30:40 <stegru> we need to think of a way to build this automatically
2018-10-18T11:31:11 * dandimitrov joined the channel
2018-10-18T11:31:36 <jhernandez> yeah
2018-10-18T11:32:31 <stegru> when I next change it, i\'ll move it into the wix-installer repo and instead of you copying the msm file, you can copy a credentials file
2018-10-18T11:33:20 <stegru> in fact, you could have a ~/.es-credentials and vagrant can put it in the guest
2018-10-18T11:33:46 <jhernandez> that approach sounds good to me

2018-10-18T13:13:17 <jhernandez> any ideas?=
2018-10-18T13:13:34 <stegru> did you uninstall first?
2018-10-18T13:14:14 <stegru> oh, paste me c:\\ProgramData\\Morphic\\Filebeat\\logs\\filebeat
2018-10-18T13:14:55 <jhernandez> yeah, it was uninstalled
2018-10-18T13:15:05 <jhernandez> before installing this new one
2018-10-18T13:15:42 <jhernandez> there are no logs
2018-10-18T13:15:53 <jhernandez> inside Morphic/filebeat
2018-10-18T13:16:16 <jhernandez> just the content
2018-10-18T13:16:44 <stegru> ok i\'ll try it
2018-10-18T13:16:57 <jhernandez> do  you want me to share this installer with you?

2018-10-18T13:22:57 <stegru> got it
2018-10-18T13:37:02 <stegru> ok jhernandez, I know how to fix it
2018-10-18T13:37:33 <jhernandez> what\'s going on?
2018-10-18T13:37:42 <Bosmon> Hi there Justin_o - somehow a bad test seems to have got into Infusion trunk
2018-10-18T13:37:45 <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/tests/framework-tests/preferences/html/WordSpacePanel-test.html#L11
2018-10-18T13:38:02 <Bosmon> This file refers to jquery-ui.js which hasn\'t existed, I think, since your update
2018-10-18T13:38:12 <Bosmon> I\'m not really sure how we\'ve been running tests successfully all this while ....
2018-10-18T13:38:50 <Bosmon> Especially given this passed and was merged more than 3 weeks ago
2018-10-18T13:40:09 <jhernandez> stegru: FYI, leaving for a walk with DOGZ now, will be back in 45 mins or so
2018-10-18T13:40:52 * danayo joined the channel
2018-10-18T13:40:59 <Bosmon> Hmm, oh, I see, this is interesting
2018-10-18T13:41:01 <stegru> fine

2018-10-18T13:41:11 * danayo_ joined the channel
2018-10-18T13:41:42 <Bosmon> If you look in the console, you can see that jquery.keyboard-a11y.js fails to load, but given we don\'t make use of it, the test mysteriously carries on to be successful
2018-10-18T13:41:50 <stegru> updated filebeat.msm, jhernandez: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/0B0EJyC9Yz9S9N3ZZb1U4NE94Tmc
2018-10-18T13:42:23 <jhernandez> stegru: okay, triggering a new build now
2018-10-18T13:42:41 <jhernandez> it\'ll be ready when I\'m back
2018-10-18T13:42:44 <stegru> ok
2018-10-18T13:42:46 <jhernandez> sweet!!
2018-10-18T13:42:55 <jhernandez> thanks :)
2018-10-18T13:42:55 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes, probably missed removing that when merging master

2018-10-18T13:44:03 <Justin_o> or i could just fix it as part of my other PR that simonjb is looking at
2018-10-18T13:44:14 <Bosmon> Justin_o - also you still have the following misspelled grade name: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/preferences/js/WordSpacePanel.js#L25
2018-10-18T13:44:50 <Justin_o> Bosmon: is it only misspelt there?
2018-10-18T13:44:54 <Bosmon> It\'s rather puzzling that this works at all
2018-10-18T13:45:02 <Bosmon> ah
2018-10-18T13:45:03 <Justin_o> yes it is puzzling
2018-10-18T13:45:11 <Bosmon> Perhaps I fixed it in my branch everywhere else except in this file
2018-10-18T13:45:23 <Justin_o> oh perhaps
2018-10-18T13:45:33 <Bosmon> These are errors I\'m running into when merging my FLUID-6148 branch up with master
2018-10-18T13:45:35 <Justin_o> although i though i did fix that
2018-10-18T13:46:15 <Bosmon> Justin_o - not in trunk, apparently: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/preferences/js/Panels.js#L799
2018-10-18T13:46:42 <Justin_o> maybe i lost it in a merge or something, but i\'m pretty sure you mentioned it before
2018-10-18T13:46:53 <Bosmon> Yes, it sounds familiar
2018-10-18T13:47:48 <Justin_o> Bosmon: how would you like me to address it? New JIRA? or with an existing PR?
2018-10-18T13:48:11 <Bosmon> Justin_o - do you have any relevant pulls underway?
2018-10-18T13:49:10 <Bosmon> Fresh JIRA+pull sounds reasonable, we can just pop this one in quickly
2018-10-18T13:53:15 <Justin_o> Bosmon: here\'s the JIRA https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6347 I\'ll take a look at it shortly

2018-10-18T14:29:10 <Justin_o> for those interested I published a new dev release of Infusion ( 3.0.0-dev.20181018T142050Z.4c3e99ffa )
2018-10-18T14:30:14 <Justin_o> Bosmon: if you have some time, can you look at the fluid-publish PRs https://github.com/fluid-project/fluid-publish/pulls Not super pressing, but it would help for those using 2FA on NPM. I\'ve been using the FLUID-6340 branch to publish infusion release because of this.
2018-10-18T14:30:58 <Bosmon> Justin_o - oh sure
2018-10-18T14:31:04 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks
2018-10-18T14:31:18 <Bosmon> Every day I muse on how incredibly useful fluid-publish is

2018-10-18T14:31:46 <Justin_o> i do quite like having dev releases

2018-10-18T14:33:56 <dandimitrov> I\'ve been having troubles with the exact time to collect coverage data from the BrowserWidndow instances (it should just before their destruction)...
2018-10-18T14:38:06 <Bosmon> Justin_o - especially the special naming scheme for releases from branches
2018-10-18T14:38:15 <Bosmon> dandimitrov - great, sounds like good progress
2018-10-18T14:44:52 <Bosmon> Cheers Justin_o - merged, published and tagged
