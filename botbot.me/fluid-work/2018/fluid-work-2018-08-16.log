2018-08-16T09:04:35 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: Hi, Antranig! Some of the tasks for QSS 1.1 will require changes to the Core. For example, "Prompt user to save QSS settings when keying in". Also, the "Save" functionality should be a lot more complex than its current version.
2018-08-16T09:07:05 <georgitodorov> Regarding the new "Save" functionality, I think we will need to discuss it and create a plan about how to proceed with it.
2018-08-16T09:09:21 <georgitodorov> As we now have a little more than 2 weeks to implement everything related to QSS 1.1, I think we need to start planning soon.

2018-08-16T15:26:04 <cindyli1> hi, Bosmon, i\'m having a problem with noUser key in and would like to ask for your advice. now lifecycle manager maintains a queue containing all user keyin and keyout requests. after processing a request on the queue, if the queue is empty and no active user is keyed in, a noUser keyin will be added to the queue. this is to make sure "noUser" is always presented when there\'s no active keyed-in user - https://github.com/cindyli/unive
2018-08-16T15:26:04 <cindyli1> rsal/blob/GPII-3193/gpii/node_modules/lifecycleManager/src/UserLogonRequest.js#L173-L179
2018-08-16T15:27:50 <cindyli1> this causes a problem, which at least can be captured by an automated test: when a keyout is requested and the queue becomes empty, but before noUser keyin has finished processing, if we use /gpiiKey to check the active keyed-in user, the system will return "no user is keyed in"
2018-08-16T15:28:34 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2018-08-16T15:28:58 <cindyli1> this also implies that, if at this moment, a keyin request for another key is received and being added to the queue, the system will likely end up with 2 keys being keyed in - "noUser" and the other key
2018-08-16T15:29:21 <cindyli> so, i wonder what\'s the proper fix for this. a couple of thoughts:
2018-08-16T15:30:13 <cindyli> 1. make noUser keyin after a keyout a part of keyout process. the keyout will always wait for noUser to be keyed in before it fires request.events.onSuccess
2018-08-16T15:30:58 <cindyli> 2. wait a milli second after a key out to send the next request. this apparently is not an ideal solution
2018-08-16T15:31:12 <cindyli> what do you think?
2018-08-16T15:32:56 * colinclark_ joined the channel
2018-08-16T15:37:56 <cindyli> Bosmon: i feel solution 1 is not ideal too as the noUser keyin is currently transparent and not connected at all with other keyin and keyout requests for actual keys. changing this transparency to establish connection btw an actual keyout and noUser keyin doesn\'t seems like a right direction
