2018-06-21T20:40:32 <gtirloni> alanharnum: hi! just a heads up since you\'re working with kettle: https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/pull/43 -- your PR could join the party too if that PR is reviewed ;D
2018-06-21T20:41:25 <alanharnum> gtirloni: what would I need to do for that?
2018-06-21T20:42:14 <alanharnum> (I suspect the answer may be "look at a previous email you\'ve sent me regarding buildkite")
2018-06-21T20:42:16 <alanharnum> :)
2018-06-21T20:42:47 <gtirloni> right now your builds are failing because my PR is the one that has the BK config (https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/pull/43)
2018-06-21T20:43:05 <gtirloni> that email is for another PR :)
2018-06-21T20:44:19 <alanharnum> I actually don\'t have the power to review Kettle PRs, or I\'d happily look at this one :)
2018-06-21T20:44:41 <michelled> you can still review it and put your notes on the request
2018-06-21T20:44:52 <michelled> then someone with push access has an easier job of it
2018-06-21T20:45:01 <alanharnum> tru dat
2018-06-21T20:47:16 <gtirloni> thanks, and sorry for the impromptu request
2018-06-21T20:47:44 <alanharnum> it\'s actually good timing, as I\'m done with code refactoring for the moment
2018-06-21T20:48:13 <alanharnum> if I add this config to my fork of Kettle, will it generate reports for me as well?
2018-06-21T20:48:23 <alanharnum> that\'s an obvious way for me to test it
2018-06-21T20:48:23 <gtirloni> yep
2018-06-21T20:48:41 <gtirloni> if your PR gets merged, I think GitHub should auto-close mine so it\'s all good either way
2018-06-21T20:50:36 <alanharnum> my PR may be a bit before merging - I need to write some documentation as well. what I\'ll do is figure out the integration with my fork in a branch and add some comments to the PR, sound reasonable?
2018-06-21T20:51:38 <alanharnum> your PR is very short, so I expect Bosmon or another pusher can merge it without too much effort if I add some review comments
2018-06-21T20:51:44 <gtirloni> sounds great, thanks!
2018-06-21T20:55:09 <alanharnum> gtirloni: so does buildkite pick up when I push a fork of the Kettle repo?
2018-06-21T20:55:51 <gtirloni> hmm you mean, you have your own fork and you push to a new branch in it?
2018-06-21T20:56:06 <gtirloni> BK only gets notified when the original repo gets a push or there\'s a new PR
2018-06-21T20:56:19 <alanharnum> ah I see
2018-06-21T20:56:23 <gtirloni> so if you want BK to test your branch in your own fork, you\'d need to open a PR (then maybe close it)
2018-06-21T20:56:29 <alanharnum> so it\'s picking up from the PR, got it
2018-06-21T20:56:32 <gtirloni> yep
2018-06-21T20:57:14 <alanharnum> I suppose there\'s no real harm in adding it to my PR - yours will likely get merged before mine anyway
2018-06-21T20:58:48 <gtirloni> yeah, worst case you\'ll need to revert that commit but that\'s it... it\'s currently not pushing any new releases or anything
2018-06-21T21:00:08 <gtirloni> building branches in your own fork is actually a good use case.. I\'m wondering if, if you add a webhook to your repo pointing to the "kettle" pipeline, what would happen? :) the pipeline does build all branches but I think when it\'s time to checkout the repo, it checks out the original repo and not yours so that might not work

2018-06-21T21:02:37 <alanharnum> gtirloni: https://buildkite.com/fluid-project/kettle/builds/21
2018-06-21T21:03:03 <alanharnum> it appears to have built from my repo/fork in that case, based on the test numbers
2018-06-21T21:07:10 <gtirloni> see the log for the "Tests" step, the "Preparing working directory", it seems to fetch from fluid-project\'s
2018-06-21T21:07:47 <gtirloni> but yeah, now your PR has the BK config and it builds fine :)
2018-06-21T21:09:02 <alanharnum> gtirloni: I can see that it\'s definitely running tests that are in my PR (the multer-related ones) that aren\'t in fluid-project yet

2018-06-21T22:46:06 * avtar1 has quit
2018-06-21T22:58:31 <gtirloni> Bosmon: there\'s the option of triggering a deploy build that would be manually allowed to run for official releases... or maybe we want a nightly build or to store the contents of each build somewhere else (now this would be a build artifact and not release a release), i think i\'m using the term release loosely in this case
2018-06-21T22:58:57 <Bosmon> gtirloni - interesting

2018-06-21T10:26:35 <javjarfer[m]> Hi Bosmon!
2018-06-21T10:26:42 <javjarfer[m]> Good morning
2018-06-21T11:02:49 <Bosmon> Hey there javjarfer[m]
2018-06-21T11:02:55 <Bosmon> DIPPLOTACKSIS
2018-06-21T11:06:21 <javjarfer[m]> haha bad weather for DIPPLOTACKSIS here now, and me too
2018-06-21T11:07:04 <javjarfer[m]> I just wanted to ask you about the retrying thing, I saw yesterday a weird behavior and wanted to know if you understands it, also if you had time to look into that PR
2018-06-21T11:15:17 <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - I\'m not sure, what weird behaviour did you see?
2018-06-21T11:17:23 <javjarfer[m]> Well, when trying to add a new solution for the pull of closedCaptions I forgot to add the new solution to the InstalledSolutions for the device reporter, and when I tried to login as the test user, the retrying functionality was launch and replaying he wasn\'t able to configure the SpiSettingsHandler call "mouse cursors", same thing every time
2018-06-21T11:18:07 <javjarfer[m]> I wasn\'t really expecting that behavior
2018-06-21T12:20:07 * alanharnum joined the channel
2018-06-21T12:24:02 * cindyli joined the channel
2018-06-21T12:27:25 <stegru> yes I get that too, javjarfer[m] - after seeing it a few times it becomes the expected behaviour ;)
2018-06-21T12:28:29 <javjarfer[m]> stegru: that is even more weird, so, you got that even with no "errors on your side"?
2018-06-21T12:28:53 <javjarfer[m]> maybe it\'s something cache related?
2018-06-21T12:29:08 <stegru> no..
2018-06-21T12:29:53 <stegru> it sorts the solutions in order of suitability.. so the best match is first
2018-06-21T12:30:35 <stegru> in your case, there are no good matches, just bad ones, and the mouse cursors happens to be the first in the list
2018-06-21T12:31:40 <stegru> it used to be the magnifier
2018-06-21T12:31:55 <Bosmon> javjarfer[m] - I see you have broken one of the testing mock functions:
2018-06-21T12:31:55 <javjarfer[m]> > it sorts the solutions in order of suitability.. so the best match is first
2018-06-21T12:31:56 <javjarfer[m]> I understand, but then it seems like we need two different classifications, the "bad matches" shouldn\'t be ever used
2018-06-21T12:31:57 <Bosmon> 21:58:47.265:  jq: FAIL: Module "gpii.tests.acceptance.linux.builtIn tests" Test name "Multiple context changes" - Message: Successful login message returned {"isError":true,"message":"Error occurred during login: Cannot read property \'mockSync\' of undefined"}
2018-06-21T12:32:02 <Bosmon> Did you see that line?
2018-06-21T12:32:08 <javjarfer[m]> because they will most probably do something completely unexpected
2018-06-21T12:34:16 <javjarfer[m]> > 21:58:47.265: jq: FAIL: Module "gpii.tests.acceptance.linux.builtIn tests" Test name "Multiple context changes" - Message: Successful login message returned {"isError":true,"message":"Error occurred during login: Cannot read property \'mockSync\' of undefined"}
2018-06-21T12:34:16 <javjarfer[m]> Yes, I saw that error, but tracing it was taking me more time than I expected
2018-06-21T12:34:36 <Bosmon> Seems a simple enough cause :)
2018-06-21T12:35:55 <javjarfer[m]> It\'s like the second check was never made before, and after my change removing the first part of the clause, that was evaluated and failed
2018-06-21T12:36:22 <Bosmon> Yes, it is possible that the 2nd check has always been faulty
2018-06-21T12:36:30 <Bosmon> The coverage report might show it as dead code : P
2018-06-21T12:36:32 <javjarfer[m]> Oh, so you mean, remove the whole test no Bosmon ?
2018-06-21T12:36:33 <javjarfer[m]> I get it
2018-06-21T12:36:50 <Bosmon> But the whole branch needs to be removed, there\'s no point simulating the behaviour if we no longer support it
2018-06-21T12:38:02 <javjarfer[m]> true, a simply applySettings should be enough now
2018-06-21T12:38:46 <javjarfer[m]> thanks Bosmon

2018-06-21T15:34:12 <Bosmon> hey there alanharnum - WAHHARNUM :)
2018-06-21T15:34:19 <Bosmon> Thanks for all your incredible work on the multi-part stuff
2018-06-21T15:35:44 <alanharnum> thanks Bosmon
2018-06-21T15:36:22 <alanharnum> I think I\'m actually just about done, just got all the tests passing again for the refactoring to use the refactored kettle.test.http.request as the base for sending multi-part forms
2018-06-21T15:37:13 <Bosmon> It\'s really good, and really helpful work
2018-06-21T15:38:09 <alanharnum> yeah I\'m pleased to have done it, both to add the facility to the middleware and the improvements to the internal testing infrastructure that you suggested
2018-06-21T15:38:36 <Bosmon> It certainly sheds light on our general move to "abolish events and invokers"
2018-06-21T15:38:44 <Bosmon> Which I puzzle more and more about as time goes by
2018-06-21T15:39:24 <alanharnum> and I know a lot more about Kettle than I did previously, which is very helpful
2018-06-21T15:39:34 <Bosmon> It struck me even more clearly when coming to rewrite our "Onward" paper yet again that we really don\'t have an answer yet in Infusion to what other languages called "method combination"
2018-06-21T15:40:07 <Bosmon> Although we have some things which are a better answer than others .....
2018-06-21T15:40:39 <alanharnum> what is "method combination" in this context?
2018-06-21T15:40:41 <Bosmon> "namespaced listeners" have the foundation to be a really good approach
2018-06-21T15:40:51 <Bosmon> But they are pretty half-baked in the incarnations we have now
2018-06-21T15:42:07 <Bosmon> I guess this terminology primarily comes from things like "CLOS"
2018-06-21T15:42:21 <Bosmon> But here is a treatment which is somewhat multi-language: http://people.cs.aau.dk/~normark/oop-csharp/html/notes/more-inheritance_themes-method-combination-sec.html
2018-06-21T15:42:39 <Bosmon> At least, two-language : P
2018-06-21T15:43:57 <Bosmon> You could see our couple of namespaced listener approaches as a variety of "declarative method combination"
2018-06-21T15:46:58 <alanharnum> Bosmon: ah, I think I see - this is related to the approach to loosely coupled collaboration on the same "thing" that we see with sequencing based on namespaced listeners
2018-06-21T15:47:10 <Bosmon> Yes
2018-06-21T15:47:33 <Bosmon> Since the original request implementation used an invoker, it turned out not to be really reusable
2018-06-21T15:47:44 <Bosmon> But this exposes a problem with the approach of using invokers at all
2018-06-21T15:48:05 <Bosmon> Which is naturally a bit hazardous since people using the framework are generally invited to use them : P
2018-06-21T15:48:25 <alanharnum> yeah it\'s a really useful pattern for many issues where you want collaboration on the same piece of data, object, etc
2018-06-21T15:48:44 <Bosmon> Our only "reuse" model for these stems from the fact that the original function implementation is always public, and so someone could always write a fresh definition which calls it some other how if they really wanted
2018-06-21T15:48:55 <Bosmon> But that\'s obviously a pretty bizarre model
2018-06-21T15:49:53 <Bosmon> Sort of analogous to the "last ditch" reuse model which our use of public functions allows through leaving the option to monkey-patch anything
2018-06-21T15:50:34 <Bosmon> You\'re always glad there is a "last ditch" rather than nothing at all, but obviously it would be better to have designed some integrated scheme

2018-06-21T15:51:33 <alanharnum> simonjb pointed gmoss and I to some interesting approaches to this using fluid.promise.fireTransformEvent, which gmoss used in the refactoring of fluid-couch-config
2018-06-21T15:52:12 <alanharnum> where you basically want that pipeline-style "do something to this data, pass it on in that changed state to the next operation"

2018-06-21T16:13:24 <Bosmon> What should I do?
2018-06-21T16:14:31 <gtirloni> hey, if you look at the settings for the infusion repo.. it should have 2 webhooks: one for buildkite and another one for the "unblock" service. I need those same webhooks on the kettle repo, except that the buildkite URL for kettle is: https://webhook.buildkite.com/deliver/264e139faebaa0a4a51c4d6c92e2109450de9b7acd3a5400fc

2018-06-21T16:16:29 <gtirloni> for reference, the unblock webhook is documented here: https://github.com/avtar/unblock-buildkite-pr-job#configure-buildkite-webhook

2018-06-21T16:17:10 <Bosmon> I see two webhooks on infusion, but the 2nd is snyk rather than unblock

2018-06-21T16:19:29 <gtirloni> avtar: could you help? i thought the unblock service needed a webhooks
2018-06-21T16:22:37 <Bosmon> gtirloni - I should have added the buildkite webhook
2018-06-21T16:23:09 <Bosmon> DOes it need anything to test it?
2018-06-21T16:25:47 <gtirloni> thanks!! it should be okay now. I can unblock manually for now.. i\'ll test with a new PR
2018-06-21T16:27:14 * VictorNG has quit
2018-06-21T16:28:01 <avtar> gtirloni: that webhook is set up on the buildkite side, not github https://buildkite.com/organizations/fluid-project/services/11274/edit
2018-06-21T16:28:27 <gtirloni> oh! makes sense
2018-06-21T16:28:30 <gtirloni> awesome
2018-06-21T16:28:31 <avtar> just one per account
2018-06-21T16:31:56 <Bosmon> gtirloni - if I say "ok to test" on an exist PR, should it test it?
2018-06-21T16:32:36 <gtirloni> no :( i think there\'s a feature request ticket opened for that
2018-06-21T16:33:26 <avtar> Bosmon: for now you can trigger a job for any pr branch from the buildkite dashboard
2018-06-21T16:36:30 <gtirloni> but it has to have had at least one build, right?
2018-06-21T16:36:33 <avtar> yup
2018-06-21T16:37:50 <avtar> when the infusion pr branches were being tested justin would push a test commit for it to show up on the bk dashboard
