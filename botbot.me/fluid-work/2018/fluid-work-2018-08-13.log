b"2018-08-13T22:09:07 <jhernandez> just in case you are doing it, take into account that we are setting the GPII_CLOUD_URL from start.cmd
2018-08-13T22:09:13 <stegru> me neither, and changing how it starts is quite risky
2018-08-13T22:09:18 <stegru> oh, bugger it then
2018-08-13T22:09:25 <jhernandez> it could be added with a distributeOptions
2018-08-13T22:09:33 <jhernandez> but yeah, let's leave it as it is right now
2018-08-13T22:09:36 <stegru> na, too much hassle for now
2018-08-13T22:09:43 <jhernandez> agree
2018-08-13T22:09:46 <stegru> he'll just have to endure it
2018-08-13T22:11:03 * jhernandez nods

2018-08-13T15:58:19 <jhernandez> not sure what\'s going wrong now
2018-08-13T15:58:46 <jhernandez> the prs have been merged and the refs are up to date if you pull from gpii-app/feds-audit
2018-08-13T15:59:25 <jhernandez> when noUser, any change I make to HC only affects windows
2018-08-13T15:59:53 <jhernandez> let me check one thing
2018-08-13T16:02:41 <cindyli> checking
2018-08-13T16:02:56 <jhernandez> nope, when "noUser", it doesn\'t apply things on UIO+
2018-08-13T16:06:37 <cindyli> jhernandez: did you merge Georgi\'s high contrast fix into feds-audit?
2018-08-13T16:06:55 <cindyli> don\'t get any updates on feds-audit
2018-08-13T16:07:01 <jhernandez> yup
2018-08-13T16:07:21 <jhernandez> okay
2018-08-13T16:07:28 <jhernandez> didn\'t push, sorry

2018-08-13T16:20:17 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: I\'m getting closer with the testem work.. The tests are running now. Incidentally this is even the case without using the new role up method. I wonder if something else changed in your latest version of gpii-testem. However, I\'m not getting any coverage reporting for the browser side
2018-08-13T16:20:33 <Justin_o> even using gpii.testem.safeRollup
2018-08-13T16:21:09 <Justin_o> although I\'m not exactly sure what the root of the testem express instance is, so i might just be configuring things wrong
2018-08-13T16:21:28 <Justin_o> also played around with the settings of testem.js but it didn\'t seem to help any
2018-08-13T16:22:11 <the-t-in-rtf> @Justin_o, I\'m off for the day, but commit what you have and I\'ll make a note in my calendar to investigate in the morning.
2018-08-13T16:22:22 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: thanks
2018-08-13T16:23:45 <the-t-in-rtf> I realise my new approach still requires you to understand exactly the two paths, we can talk about how/whether we can improve on that.
2018-08-13T16:24:29 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: sure, yes we can chat about that
2018-08-13T16:55:27 <jhernandez> Bosmon: JFYI, things are working better right now
2018-08-13T16:55:44 <jhernandez> however, we have a small remaining "thing"
2018-08-13T16:56:19 <Bosmon> jhernandez - things working better sounds great
2018-08-13T16:57:28 <jhernandez> now, when keying in with a user that has a high contrast theme enabled, the QSS doesn\'t update the value of HighContrast, as it is bound to common/highContrastTheme path and not anymore to com.microsoft.windows.highContrast/common/highContrastTheeme
2018-08-13T16:58:28 <Bosmon> jhernandez yes, that is what we planned
2018-08-13T16:59:21 <jhernandez> yes, but what is shown as enabled in the QSS is wrong (whereas in the system are applied the good values)
2018-08-13T16:59:42 <jhernandez> do you know what I mean?
2018-08-13T17:00:32 <jhernandez> I don\'t see danail around, so don\'t know whether we should a) ship it as it is right now, b) wait until they are around tomorrow or c) try adjusting this by ourselves

2018-08-13T17:27:38 <colinclark> Justin_o: Does it impact tomorrow\'s APCP demos?
2018-08-13T17:29:07 <Justin_o> shouldn\'t
2018-08-13T17:29:25 <Justin_o> it\'s an infusion demo

2018-08-13T18:44:11 <cindyli> yes, Justin_o. the fix has already been merged into feds-audit branch
2018-08-13T18:44:44 <Justin_o> cindyli: oh excellent thanks.. so i can drop that from my list of things to look into
2018-08-13T18:45:26 <cindyli> ya.
2018-08-13T18:45:46 <Justin_o> thanks
2018-08-13T18:51:54 <cindyli> simonjb: i\'ve merged Justin_o\'s demo fix pull request - https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/919

2018-08-13T19:01:48 <Justin_o> jhernandez: I just published a beta 6 of UIO+ which includes the YouTube captions features. It will probably take about 1 hr for it to show up on the chrome web store
2018-08-13T19:02:38 <jhernandez> Justin_o: oh wow, awesome news!!!

2018-08-13T19:04:41 <cindyli> Bosmon: there\'s a bug found during the demo sprint with the untrusted + dynamicDR config used by PSP/QSS. this bug has been fixed in the feds-audit branch. I issued a pull request against the master branch too - https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/652. can you please review and merge? thanks
2018-08-13T19:04:51 <jhernandez> I assume a few minutes ago
2018-08-13T19:04:56 <Justin_o> jhernandez: just a few minutes ago yes
2018-08-13T19:05:01 <jhernandez> okok
2018-08-13T19:06:06 <Bosmon> cindyli it looks reasonable to me
2018-08-13T19:06:29 <Bosmon> Although why is the deviceReporter\'s solutions registry not always the same as the flowManager\'s?
2018-08-13T19:06:34 <Bosmon> Shouldn\'t we set it up so it could never diverge?
2018-08-13T19:07:34 * jeevan_ joined the channel
2018-08-13T19:07:37 * jeevan_ has quit
2018-08-13T19:11:11 <cindyli> good point.
2018-08-13T19:11:41 <jhernandez> Bosmon: in fact, that was (more or less) the source of our problem yesterday and the reason why we had to point the system to use my dev cluster
2018-08-13T19:12:27 <Bosmon> cindyli - it seems easy enough to set up the distribution within the flowManager itself
2018-08-13T19:12:45 <Bosmon> It needn\'t specifically mention the "live" DR but simply any SR within any DR
2018-08-13T19:12:47 <Justin_o> jhernandez: just reading your e-mail about the latest installer. Regarding the low contrast themes not working, does the black-brow work? I wonder if something changed with the onboarding that is affecting them?
2018-08-13T19:13:08 <Bosmon> This is the kind of thing the distributions system was always meant for in any case
2018-08-13T19:13:12 <jhernandez> I realized that the deviceReporter is using the local solutions registry but the cloud-based FW uses its own to prepare the payloads for the local one
2018-08-13T19:14:03 <jhernandez> Justin_o: probably it is the first thing to look at
2018-08-13T19:14:49 <jhernandez> IIRC, they were working before - but probably I\'m wrong
2018-08-13T19:15:40 <Bosmon> Well I see now that the config you have targetted is the highest one in which the problem arises
2018-08-13T19:15:45 <Bosmon> So perhaps the PR is ok as it stands
2018-08-13T19:15:57 <Justin_o> I haven\'t seen the qss working with uio+ much.. but i thought it was working.. i could be mistaken though
2018-08-13T19:15:57 <cindyli> Bosmon: but "gpii.deviceReporter.static" doesn\'t expect to have "solutionsRegistryDataSource" subcomponent. It uses a different data source that reads directly from the file - https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/deviceReporter/src/DeviceReporter.js#L89
2018-08-13T19:16:45 <cindyli> Bosmon: distributing from flowManager may should still target ".live" version
2018-08-13T19:17:40 * gmoss_ joined the channel
2018-08-13T19:17:58 <Bosmon> But the structure here is pretty nuts - I notice that flowmanager.local *always* has a "deviceReporterDataSource" configured into it
2018-08-13T19:18:02 <jhernandez> Justin_o: I can see a reason for it, look at https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/feds-audit/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L3418 and https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/blob/feds-audit/testData/qss/settings.json#L86
2018-08-13T19:18:28 <Bosmon> And all that we have is the deviceReporter pointed back to localhost as another security-violating HTTP service
2018-08-13T19:18:30 <jhernandez> there\'s a discrepancy in there, it should be "grey-black" but "grey-white" is not working for me either
2018-08-13T19:18:42 <Bosmon> This is something that sgithens needs to add to his "endpoint audit" if it is not there already
2018-08-13T19:19:13 <Justin_o> jhernandez: i took those values from a document i got fro the UX team.. regarding the second one.. the spelling of "gray" is different too.. gray vs grey
2018-08-13T19:19:21 <Bosmon> cindyli - yes I think the pull is probably good
2018-08-13T19:19:23 <jhernandez> ohh
2018-08-13T19:19:27 <cindyli> cool
2018-08-13T19:19:35 <jhernandez> oohh I see
2018-08-13T19:19:50 <Justin_o> jhernandez: i don\'t have a preference for what those value should be though.. as long as the right hand side comes in as what I\'ve set, UIO+ should work
2018-08-13T19:20:16 <jhernandez> yes
2018-08-13T19:20:18 <jhernandez> okay
2018-08-13T19:20:25 <jhernandez> let me try locally
2018-08-13T19:21:06 <Justin_o> okay, hopefully that\'s it because the fix will be relatively easy..
2018-08-13T19:22:48 <jhernandez> right
2018-08-13T19:24:42 <Justin_o> jhernandez: let me know if you need me to do anything for that
2018-08-13T19:25:15 * victorng1 has quit
2018-08-13T19:25:52 <jhernandez> Justin_o: I can do it, thanks, also, may we also need "regular-contrast"?
2018-08-13T19:26:48 <jhernandez> or is it fine by having "default"?
2018-08-13T19:27:08 <Justin_o> jhernandez: things should default to "default" which says not to apply any contrast themes
2018-08-13T19:27:44 <Justin_o> jhernandez: yes.. should be fine.. actually i believe anything that doesn\'t fit into the match should ended up resulting in "default" being sent
2018-08-13T19:30:40 <jhernandez> ok

2018-08-13T20:14:22 <sgithens> Bosmon: What should the audit script check?  Requests back to localhost services?
2018-08-13T20:14:54 <Bosmon> sgithens - wasn\'t that what it is meant to check?
2018-08-13T20:15:20 <sgithens> oooh, is the 127.0.0.1 vs localhost thing?
2018-08-13T20:15:31 <sgithens> s/is/is this/
2018-08-13T20:15:38 <Bosmon> no
2018-08-13T20:16:02 <sgithens> the audit script really just listed all the express and kettle endpoints that are on in a live system
2018-08-13T20:16:15 <sgithens> but of course we can add more stuff
2018-08-13T20:16:40 <sgithens> Bosmon: You want to check if any datasources are configured to go to a localhost?
2018-08-13T20:17:06 <Bosmon> sgithens - I think we planned to remove all unnecessary HTTP localhost services, right?
2018-08-13T20:17:14 <Bosmon> Of which the deviceReporter certainly seems to be a one
2018-08-13T20:17:20 <sgithens> Bosmon: Certainly
2018-08-13T20:17:23 <Bosmon> Ideally a "production" release will be delivered with none of these
2018-08-13T20:17:44 <sgithens> is this datasource specific or is it a kettle/express endpoint?
2018-08-13T20:17:56 <Bosmon> Both
2018-08-13T20:17:58 <sgithens> ok
2018-08-13T20:18:40 <sgithens> The script worked by querying IoCSS component grades at runtime, so we could add a few rules to check and dump datasources
2018-08-13T21:18:47 <stegru> jhernandez: I could make a fix to the installer to get rid of that console window, if you think it\'s important enough?

2018-08-13T13:30:46 <Bosmon> Hi there cindyli
2018-08-13T13:30:52 <Bosmon> I\'m on the call with Gregg, Astea etc.
2018-08-13T13:31:04 <Bosmon> He has reported the following issues in his walkthrough of Friday\'s build -
2018-08-13T13:31:16 <Bosmon> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PkQc4oJt8Xa_7v4e4HCjUbelJwEDS06ftCg2XNz1mZQ/edit
2018-08-13T13:31:47 <Bosmon> So it seems that the expectation is indeed that the high contrast setting in the QSS enables high contrast in both Windows and UIO+ separatly
2018-08-13T13:32:32 <Bosmon> Which suggests we should revisit our decision from Friday
2018-08-13T13:32:55 <Bosmon> On the upside, Gregg has said that we do not need to deal with the complexity of finding existing scoped high contrast settings in the preference set, as we see in snapset_2a
2018-08-13T13:33:39 <Bosmon> The QSS will only need to deal with preference sets that start out empty
2018-08-13T13:35:42 <Bosmon> So I\'m wondering if there\'s a quick way we can "patch up" our fake matchMaker so that it can achieve this behaviour in simple cases?
2018-08-13T13:35:57 <Bosmon> Gregg also says that it is not too important if the right controls don\'t show up in the PSP in this case, as long as it actually works
2018-08-13T13:41:54 <cindyli> Bosmon: ok. PSP/QSS probably should switch back to use the short form of "http://registry.gpii.net/common/highContrast". i can then patch up the lifecycle manager to translate it to "com.microsoft.windows.highContrast" and "UIO/highContrast". what do you think?
2018-08-13T13:42:55 <Bosmon> cindyli - yes, that sounds right
2018-08-13T13:43:23 <cindyli> ok. start working on it
2018-08-13T13:44:32 <Bosmon> georgitodorov ^
2018-08-13T13:45:18 <georgitodorov> cindyli, Bosmon: Okay, I can make the corresponding changes in the QSS
2018-08-13T13:45:26 <cindyli> thanks, georgitodorov
2018-08-13T13:46:48 <georgitodorov> cindyli, Bosmon: Should I do it in a separate branch until your changes in the Core are ready?
2018-08-13T13:49:49 <cindyli> georgitodorov: good idea
2018-08-13T13:50:12 <Bosmon> Thanks both
2018-08-13T13:50:50 <Bosmon> cindyli - so once we have a basic fix for this, there is a further extremely peculiar issue that you can see in Gregg\'s walkthrough - that somehow there seems to be an interaction between the different settings for UIO+
2018-08-13T13:51:10 <Bosmon> In that very strangely, after you enable "read aloud", there somehow is indeed the high contrast setting applied in UIO+
2018-08-13T13:52:20 <Bosmon> It\'s unclear at which point in the workflow this happens, and whether it is a bug in UIO+ itself, or in our settings bus, or some strange round of reverse matchmaking that occurs in between application of the two settings
2018-08-13T13:52:47 <Bosmon> We probably won\'t have time to look at this in time for tomorrow, but let\'s see if fixing one issue can mask the other at least
2018-08-13T13:53:03 <cindyli> ok
2018-08-13T13:54:38 * g2szeto joined the channel
2018-08-13T13:59:02 <cindyli> georgitodorov: could you let me know when your branch for the high contrast work is ready? thanks
2018-08-13T13:59:30 <georgitodorov> cindyli: just waiting for the status call to be over to start working on this
2018-08-13T14:00:00 <cindyli> sure. thanks, georgitodorov
2018-08-13T14:04:19 * colinclark joined the channel
2018-08-13T14:07:51 <georgitodorov> cindyli: In the QSS we have only a setting for the high contrast theme. Will it suffice if I change it to "http://registry\\\\.gpii\\\\.net/common/highContrastTheme"?
2018-08-13T14:11:29 <cindyli> georgitodorov: sure. what if when the contrast is turned off?
2018-08-13T14:11:39 <cindyli> do you send highContrastEnabled "false"
2018-08-13T14:11:50 <cindyli> or highContrastTheme "regular-contrast"?
2018-08-13T14:11:58 <georgitodorov> cindyli: the second one
2018-08-13T14:12:02 <cindyli> great
2018-08-13T14:16:14 <jhernandez> cindyli, georgitodorov: FYI, the code in the installer is exactly the same as what you get if pulling from gpii-app/feds-audit, as usually
2018-08-13T14:19:44 <georgitodorov> cindyli, jhernandez: This is the branch which contains the renamed highContrastTheme setting in the QSS: https://github.com/danailbd/gpii-app/tree/feature/highContrastThemeFix
2018-08-13T14:20:09 <georgitodorov> jhernandez: This branch will need to go together with Cindy\'s fixes on the Core end
2018-08-13T14:20:30 <jhernandez> ok
2018-08-13T14:20:33 <georgitodorov> They should go either together or not at all
2018-08-13T14:21:15 <jhernandez> georgitodorov: and just to be sure, I need to pull from both QSS and highContrastThemeFix branches
2018-08-13T14:21:20 <jhernandez> isn\'t it?
2018-08-13T14:22:02 <georgitodorov> jhernandez: yes (even though the highContrastThemeFix has everything from feature/QSS)
2018-08-13T14:22:05 <jhernandez> or does highContrastThemeFix already include the last changes on QSS
2018-08-13T14:22:07 <jhernandez> ok
2018-08-13T14:22:43 <jhernandez> beacause I saw a commit arriving at the QSS branch a few minutes ago
2018-08-13T14:22:49 <jhernandez> that\'s why I was asking
2018-08-13T14:22:51 <jhernandez> okay
2018-08-13T14:23:08 <jhernandez> will pull from both just in case there\'s anything new
2018-08-13T14:23:31 <jhernandez> thanks
2018-08-13T14:23:57 <georgitodorov> jhernandez: thank you, too!

2018-08-13T15:04:35 <Justin_o> Bosmon: hello.. my PR for GPII-3154 is ready for more review. https://github.com/GPII/gpii-chrome-extension/pull/12
2018-08-13T15:07:44 <jhernandez> cindyli: yes, that\'s because you have to sswitch the GPII_CLOUD_URL to use my cluster

2018-08-13T15:15:21 <cindyli> jhernandez: high contrast fix in the universal core - https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/651
2018-08-13T15:15:52 <cindyli> it should go in together with its gpii-app partner - https://github.com/danailbd/gpii-app/tree/feature/highContrastThemeFix
2018-08-13T15:16:02 <jhernandez> okay, then I should be ready to pull
2018-08-13T15:16:08 <cindyli> yes. thanks
2018-08-13T15:16:27 <jhernandez> I will also pull stegru\'s fix on the USB "thing"
2018-08-13T15:16:34 <jhernandez> great
2018-08-13T15:16:51 <jhernandez> thanks for having this fixed ASAP
2018-08-13T15:17:12 <Bosmon> jhernandez, stegru - I\'m wondering about stegru\'s fix, and whether this is a problem in the core that should properly be looked at later by cindyli with respect to "noUser"?
2018-08-13T15:17:24 <jhernandez> there\'s still room for another last update in case we need it
2018-08-13T15:17:32 <jhernandez> Bosmon: that would be great
2018-08-13T15:17:32 <Bosmon> Is this a fix which stegru thinks is appropriate to be merged into master or is it just a quick fix
2018-08-13T15:17:44 <jhernandez> it\'s a quick fix
2018-08-13T15:18:43 <jhernandez> Bosmon: short story, usb listener uses login/logout endpoints
2018-08-13T15:18:46 * the-t-in-rtf joined the channel
2018-08-13T15:18:52 <stegru> far from suitable for master
2018-08-13T15:19:00 <jhernandez> which conflicts with the noUser always been keyed in
2018-08-13T15:19:47 <jhernandez> so he changed the usb to use proximityTriggered rather  than login/logout endpoints
2018-08-13T15:19:54 * jeevan_ joined the channel
2018-08-13T15:20:04 <jhernandez> which led to the problem that Gregg reported in the doc
2018-08-13T15:20:12 <stegru> GPII-3283:
2018-08-13T15:20:14 <stegru> http://win10-test:8081/user/salem/login
2018-08-13T15:20:14 <stegru> User with GPII key salem was successfully logged in.
2018-08-13T15:20:14 <stegru> http://win10-test:8081/user/salem/logout
2018-08-13T15:20:14 <stegru> {"isError":true,"message":"Got logout request from user salem, but the user noUser is logged in. So ignoring the request."}
2018-08-13T15:20:48 <jhernandez> which is that, if you key-in with usb and key-out from the PSP, the system will key-in back again when you pull the usb out of the pc
2018-08-13T15:21:38 <cindyli> this should be fixed when my proper implementation for "noUser" is in place
2018-08-13T15:21:39 <jhernandez> for which stegru issued this fix https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/1653353a72cd93f5
2018-08-13T15:21:48 <jhernandez> ookps
2018-08-13T15:21:52 <jhernandez> wrong link
2018-08-13T15:21:59 <stegru> i\'m not fixing gmail
2018-08-13T15:22:02 <jhernandez> https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/650/files
2018-08-13T15:22:04 <jhernandez> xDDDD
2018-08-13T15:23:08 <jhernandez> cindyli: right, that\'s why stegru and I think that it\'s not meant for master
2018-08-13T15:24:55 <cindyli> ok
2018-08-13T15:27:35 <stegru> will gregg be wanting to use the login urls in the browser? if so, they\'re not going to work
2018-08-13T15:28:40 <jhernandez> stegru: right, we must be sure he\'s aware of that
2018-08-13T15:28:52 <jhernandez> but I don\'t think he\'s going to do that
2018-08-13T15:29:04 <jhernandez> in the demo, as the plan is using usbs
2018-08-13T15:30:21 <stegru> btw jhernandez, i\'m doing lower priority stuff now. let me know if you need me
2018-08-13T15:33:31 <jhernandez> stegru: sure, thanks
2018-08-13T15:33:33 <jhernandez> :)
