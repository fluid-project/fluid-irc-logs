2018-07-16T21:50:42 <Bosmon> Hi there mrtyler - I've just merged Cindy's GPII-1990
2018-07-16T21:50:49 <Bosmon> What would you like to do about https://github.com/gpii-ops/gpii-infra/pull/54/files ?
2018-07-16T21:52:40 <mrtyler> hmm, looks like cindyli is gone
2018-07-16T21:53:21 <Bosmon> Shall I just merge it? I guess it couldn't do any more harm than having CD broken
2018-07-16T21:53:26 <mrtyler> Bosmon: i suppose i can merge her PR without her. if everything goes well, then we're done. if not, we re-evaluate
2018-07-16T21:53:36 <Bosmon> Sure, give it a go
2018-07-16T21:53:51 <mrtyler> i'd like to see the build fail first, just to be sure :)
2018-07-16T21:53:54 <mrtyler> the gpii-infra build*
2018-07-16T21:53:56 <Bosmon> ok
2018-07-16T21:54:14 <mrtyler> but thanks for the heads up. i'll keep an eye on it
2018-07-16T21:55:48 <mrtyler> for anyone playing along at home, the gpii-infra build that is about to start (https://gitlab.com/gpii-ops/gpii-infra/pipelines/25878295) has the dataloader updates, but not the universal updates, from cindy's branch
2018-07-16T21:56:00 <mrtyler> so the next build should be the fun one
2018-07-16T21:59:39 <mrtyler> this one: https://gitlab.com/gpii-ops/gpii-infra/pipelines/25878517
2018-07-16T22:00:20 <Bosmon> Well, it's always productive to verify that things fail as one expects :)
2018-07-16T22:00:49 <Bosmon> I remember the time a certain developer overrode all our test error handlers so that all failures were reported as successes
2018-07-16T22:02:08 <mrtyler> #define assert console.log

2018-07-16T09:08:57 <the-t-in-rtf> @Bosmon or anyone else who has worked with resolvers like this: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/lifecycleManager/src/Resolvers.js#L26
2018-07-16T09:09:23 <the-t-in-rtf> My question is, where does the resolver need to be wired into.  The ones there are only wired into the lifecycle manager.
2018-07-16T09:09:23 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - no, not that kind of resolver
2018-07-16T09:09:35 <the-t-in-rtf> ah, good that I asked then.
2018-07-16T09:09:53 <the-t-in-rtf> You mean like this kind: https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/blob/master/docs/ConfigsAndApplications.md#referring-to-external-data-via-resolvers
2018-07-16T09:09:53 <Bosmon> It\'s this kind: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/lifecycleManager/src/Resolvers.js#L132
2018-07-16T09:10:43 <Bosmon> And here is the one that does builtins: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/lifecycleManager/src/LifecycleManagerSession.js#L108
2018-07-16T09:11:10 <Bosmon> In theory you could already reach the material you need via the session resolver but it would look appalling and be horribly unstable
2018-07-16T09:11:56 <the-t-in-rtf> So, I don\'t see any examples in the win32.json5 file itself of the ${{summat}} pattern.
2018-07-16T09:12:03 <the-t-in-rtf> I assume there are examples in various config files?
2018-07-16T09:12:12 <Bosmon> Although I think in practice you *will* end up resolving it from here, just via a nicer syntax that gives you a shortcut to *this* solution\'s entry
2018-07-16T09:13:02 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - you just need to look harder : P
2018-07-16T09:13:03 <Bosmon> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L631
2018-07-16T09:13:33 <the-t-in-rtf> no, I needed to turn of regexp searching.
2018-07-16T09:13:37 <the-t-in-rtf> s/of/off/
2018-07-16T09:13:52 <Bosmon> That\'s certainly a good way of looking harder : P
2018-07-16T09:13:58 <Bosmon> "Now you have two problems"
2018-07-16T09:14:38 <Bosmon> sorry, 100 problems
2018-07-16T09:14:40 <Bosmon> https://xkcd.com/1171/
2018-07-16T09:14:42 <the-t-in-rtf> yes.
2018-07-16T09:14:56 <the-t-in-rtf> 99 problems is a hip hop reference that I would not expect you to remember.
2018-07-16T09:15:42 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, I guess I need a bit further advice on how you saw this working.
2018-07-16T09:16:02 <Bosmon> I was imagining you\'d create a new resolver key named "solution"
2018-07-16T09:16:11 <the-t-in-rtf> ah, good, that was my original though.
2018-07-16T09:16:12 <the-t-in-rtf> t
2018-07-16T09:16:20 <Bosmon> Which would resolve from within the solution to its own entry
2018-07-16T09:16:41 <the-t-in-rtf> Or I guess to an effective neighbour of some kind.
2018-07-16T09:17:08 <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. there would be a base JAWS solution and the others would refer to the common bits from that.
2018-07-16T09:17:25 <the-t-in-rtf> My question then is, what things are resolvable?
2018-07-16T09:17:27 <Bosmon> Well, in the fullness of time, we\'ll turn these into grades as we were planning
2018-07-16T09:17:31 <Bosmon> But this is just a stopgap measure
2018-07-16T09:17:58 <the-t-in-rtf> yes, I was thinking in fact of making the resolver a harness that lets us incrementally insert schema-backed grades into our legacy format.
2018-07-16T09:18:18 <the-t-in-rtf> but I need to understand what things can be resolved at all.
2018-07-16T09:18:32 <the-t-in-rtf> Anything within the entire solutions file?
2018-07-16T09:18:47 <Bosmon> https://github.com/GPII/gpii-payloads/blob/master/CloudBasedMatchMaker.md
2018-07-16T09:18:55 <Bosmon> This payload is probably still more or less accurate
2018-07-16T09:19:17 <Bosmon> Part of the matchmaking process will dump into your session an excerpt from the solutions registry named "solutionsRegistryEntries"
2018-07-16T09:19:34 <Bosmon> I think all you will need to do is write a tiny adapter that arranges for the reference to resolve onto "this solution"
2018-07-16T09:20:31 <Bosmon> Although if you find that this payload is substantially wrong, which it might well be, a pull against this repo would be greatly appreciated :)
2018-07-16T09:21:39 <the-t-in-rtf> Well, I\'ll have to make a pull for the JAWS onboarding in any case.
2018-07-16T09:21:48 <the-t-in-rtf> I was going to include a sketch there assuming I can manage it.
2018-07-16T09:21:55 <Bosmon> A pull against gpii-payloads?
2018-07-16T09:22:23 <the-t-in-rtf> No, against universal.
2018-07-16T09:22:37 <the-t-in-rtf> but that\'s my original question, where do I need to add the resolver?
2018-07-16T09:22:44 <the-t-in-rtf> Also to the lifecycle manager?
2018-07-16T09:22:53 <the-t-in-rtf> or to gpii-payloads?
2018-07-16T09:22:55 <Bosmon> You can put it near the one I linked
2018-07-16T09:22:58 <the-t-in-rtf> great.
2018-07-16T09:23:04 <Bosmon> gpii-payloads is a repository of documentation
2018-07-16T09:23:09 <the-t-in-rtf> aah.
2018-07-16T09:23:17 <Bosmon> I was suggesting that if you found the docs were inaccurate you might correct them
2018-07-16T09:23:20 <the-t-in-rtf> Right, I get it now.
2018-07-16T09:24:15 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, thanks, I certainly have enough toes and ammo now.
2018-07-16T09:24:21 <Bosmon> awesome
2018-07-16T09:24:24 <the-t-in-rtf> I will report back once I have something further to discuss.
2018-07-16T09:24:29 <Bosmon> I might take a short nap since I was "left in charge" this morning
2018-07-16T09:24:53 <the-t-in-rtf> Enjoy.

2018-07-16T13:21:26 <cindyli> good morning, Bosmon. thanks for the comments on my pull for GPII-1990. regarding this comment - https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/628#pullrequestreview-137272072, do u mean to combine "gpii.flowManager.ws" into "gpii.flowmanager" so the kettle servers for hosting either the local or cloud flow manager will be "kettle.server.ws" by default?
2018-07-16T13:21:38 * simonjb joined the channel
2018-07-16T13:21:40 <Bosmon> cindyli - yes
2018-07-16T13:22:06 <cindyli> cool. thanks
2018-07-16T13:29:47 <cindyli> Bosmon: "gpii.flowManager.ws" exposes /browserChannel and /pspChannel endpoints (https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/GPII-1990/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/src/FlowManager.js#L158-L165) that seem only make sense to be on local flow manager. shall i combine "gpii.flowManager.ws" into "gpii.flowmanager.local" only, but still apply "kettle.server.ws" to both servers for hosting local and cloud flow managers so the cloud is prepar
2018-07-16T13:29:47 <cindyli> ed for web socket requests too?
2018-07-16T13:30:02 <Bosmon> cindyli - yes please
2018-07-16T13:30:07 <cindyli> ok. thanks
2018-07-16T13:50:54 <cindyli> hi jhernandez, if you haven\'t started to refactor https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/627/files, i\'m thinking to refactor it myself and include in the pull request for GPII-1990 - https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/628. what do you think?
