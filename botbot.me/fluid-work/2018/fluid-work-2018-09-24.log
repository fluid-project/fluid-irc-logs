b"2018-09-24T16:15:58 <the-t-in-rtf> if you can't figure it by the end of the day, at mention me in the pull or send me a link to the branch.
2018-09-24T16:16:02 <the-t-in-rtf> I can try it out in the morning.
2018-09-24T16:16:36 <gmoss> cindyli: I may have accidentally stumbled upon the solution. I can't reproduce the error now, though I can't explain what's changed either. Will try to figure out what I did
2018-09-24T16:17:01 <gmoss> thank goodness for git diff

2018-09-24T20:24:38 <gmoss> Justin_o: ^^^  thanks for all of your help thus far, I think I've nailed it down
2018-09-24T20:25:09 <Justin_o> gmoss: oh that's great.. sorry i looked a bit over the weekend but didn't get a lot of time to really focus on it
2018-09-24T20:25:13 <Justin_o> what was the solution?
2018-09-24T20:25:44 <gmoss> I'm not sure quite what did it, but I was able to trim out my contextAware bits, and I refactored the functions that update the panels
2018-09-24T20:27:00 <gmoss> Justin_o: scratch that, I've just discovered an issue -_- haha... I thought I was finally free
2018-09-24T20:29:27 <Justin_o> ah.. closer at least
2018-09-24T20:30:40 <Justin_o> gmoss: I was thinking today when I was out, that it would be better if this in the prefs framework instead of UIO directly. Even if it was just in for the separated panel.
2018-09-24T20:30:52 <Justin_o> not sure how hard it would be to move things over there though
2018-09-24T20:32:21 <gmoss> Justin_o: I think I'll get things back into a working state, but after that I'll take a look and see how much work it looks like it'll be
2018-09-24T20:33:11 <Justin_o> gmoss: okay, sounds good

2018-09-24T21:12:02 <Justin_o> gmoss: is there something you'd like me to look at for FLUID-6300
2018-09-24T21:12:33 <gmoss> Justin_o: sure, if you have time! the PR is here: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/937
2018-09-24T21:12:58 <gmoss> i'll start looking at how much it would take to move everything to the prefs framework
2018-09-24T21:13:19 <Justin_o> gmoss: is everything working in the PR now, or is there still a bug?
2018-09-24T21:13:45 <gmoss> Justin_o: it's all working in my environment, now
2018-09-24T21:13:56 <Justin_o> gmoss: ah great.. will take a look at the PR
2018-09-24T21:14:04 <gmoss> Justin_o: thanks!
2018-09-24T21:15:29 <gmoss> Justin_o: so just to be clear, what you're suggesting is that instead of having the localized component be an extension of fluid.uiOptions.prefsEditor, it should be extended from fluid.prefs.separatedPanel?
2018-09-24T21:17:48 <Justin_o> gmoss: yes, something more like lazy loading
2018-09-24T21:18:43 <Justin_o> i guess it would be even better if it would work with any flavour of the prefs editor, but it may be okay to start with just the separated panel
2018-09-24T21:22:48 <gmoss> Justin_o: I'll start with the separated panel :) btw I've already noticed an issue with my documentation for one of the functions
2018-09-24T21:24:33 <Justin_o> oh which one is that
2018-09-24T21:25:34 <gmoss> commit incoming ;)
2018-09-24T21:25:42 <gmoss> just waiting for the linter
2018-09-24T21:26:28 <Justin_o> gmoss: by the way, the PR has failing tests in the build. https://ci.fluidproject.org/job/infusion-pr-browser-tests/64/console looks like it's around the language change in Firefox
2018-09-24T21:28:31 <gmoss> Justin_o: thanks for pointing that out. odd that it only seems to be complaining about one of the strings.. unless it's skipping the rest on account of the failed check
2018-09-24T21:29:40 <gmoss> there's another build in the pipe, waiting to see how that goes
2018-09-24T21:31:48 <Justin_o> I'm going to try to run it through vagrant locally
2018-09-24T21:32:12 <gmoss> okay thanks Justin_o. I still haven't managed to get my vagrant tests running on my laptop
2018-09-24T21:43:20 <Justin_o> gmoss: okay, just finished rebuilding the vagrant vm.. running the tests now.. by the way did you merge with master?
2018-09-24T21:43:42 <gmoss> Justin_o: I checked this morning and there was nothing to pull from master, so I think I'm up to date? let me double-check
2018-09-24T21:43:53 * Bosmon3 has quit
2018-09-24T21:44:24 <gmoss> Justin_o: yep, it's up to date
2018-09-24T21:50:35 <Justin_o> gmoss: tests passed on my vagrant vm.
2018-09-24T21:50:57 <Justin_o> lets see what happens with CI
2018-09-24T21:51:08 <gmoss> Justin_o: that's good to hear. I hope whatever failed on CI was just from before I addressed that last bug
2018-09-24T21:51:23 <gmoss> I'm currently trying to get everything moved over to separatedPanel
2018-09-24T21:53:05 <Justin_o> gmoss: great, I'm working my way through the PR on GitHub.
2018-09-24T21:53:37 <gmoss> Justin_o: i wonder if you shouldn't hold off until i'm a little further with this task? things might change if i continue down this path
2018-09-24T21:53:50 <gmoss> *things will change significantly
2018-09-24T21:54:00 <Justin_o> :) okay sounds good
2018-09-24T21:54:04 <Justin_o> thanks for the warning
2018-09-24T21:54:14 <gmoss> np at all.
2018-09-24T22:01:22 <Justin_o> gmoss: looks like CI failed again at the same spot. We may need to talk to alanharnum about the VMs configuration so that we can replicate it
2018-09-24T22:07:53 <alanharnum> Justin_o gmoss: those VMs have pretty limited memory/CPU compared to a developer laptop, so if this is still the race condition issue, it's possible that's what's going on
2018-09-24T22:08:33 <Justin_o> alanharnum: do you have the numbers for those, and is it easy to update the vagrant config to temporarily match?
2018-09-24T22:11:20 <alanharnum> Justin_o: I'm not sure about processor details without further investigation, but you can see some details in the Vagrantfile: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/Vagrantfile
2018-09-24T22:11:55 <Justin_o> alanharnum: thanks, but those should be the same then when i run the vagrant vm from my machine
2018-09-24T22:11:59 <Justin_o> the same as CI
2018-09-24T22:12:41 <Justin_o> i guess the environment variables may be set in CI
2018-09-24T22:13:12 <alanharnum> I actually don't know enough about how CPU emulation works in a VM to say for sure that would be the case
2018-09-24T22:14:05 <gmoss> Justin_o alanharnum: very odd... perhaps I never solved the issue at all and it was just coincidence, and somehow even with my CPU throttling I was unable to reproduce the bug yet it was still present
2018-09-24T22:14:48 <alanharnum> Is the CI (https://ci.fluidproject.org/job/infusion-pr-browser-tests/67/console) failing on the same spot as it did before?
2018-09-24T22:15:26 <alanharnum> I see all the Chrome tests passing but Firefox failing, which I believe is what was happening before?
2018-09-24T22:16:26 <Justin_o> alanharnum: that's what happened before, but the actual failure looks a bit different. Not sure if it's the same exact issue or something similar
2018-09-24T22:19:32 <gmoss> Justin_o alanharnum that's consistent with what I was seeing last week and early this morning
2018-09-24T22:20:08 <gmoss> I thought it had stopped, though, even with my CPUkiller at 100% (i could previously reliably reproduce the bug with the program set to 25%)
2018-09-24T22:20:32 <gmoss> I re-ran the tests about a dozen times just to see if it was a fluke
2018-09-24T22:20:44 <gmoss> I must have missed something
2018-09-24T22:22:25 <alanharnum> gmoss Justin_o: I'm going to see if I can pull some CPU profile information from the CI VM
2018-09-24T22:25:14 <gmoss> thanks alanharnum
2018-09-24T22:25:29 <gmoss> Justin_o: I think I'm going to hold off on moving things to the SeparatedPanel at this point
2018-09-24T22:25:51 <gmoss> there are some things I don't quite grasp about the way it works, just yet
2018-09-24T22:26:09 <Justin_o> gmoss: okay
2018-09-24T22:26:21 <Justin_o> i guess might as well try to track down this failure first
2018-09-24T22:27:08 <gmoss> indeed. beyond that, I'll need to figure out how to determine what fluid.uiOptions.prefsEditor and its components has that fluid.prefs.separatedPanel does not
2018-09-24T22:29:55 <gmoss> going to sign off for today, running out of steam
2018-09-24T22:30:22 <Justin_o> gmoss: thanks, i'll be in the office tomorrow if you want to talk about it some more
2018-09-24T22:30:30 <gmoss> Justin_o: sounds good. see you then
2018-09-24T22:34:21 <alanharnum> gmoss Justin_o: I pulled some info comparing the CPUs in the VM running on my local vs the VM running on the CI machine: https://gist.github.com/waharnum/ffa080378839acc5e6316e3f70b4467c
2018-09-24T22:35:59 <alanharnum> if anything i suspect the CI build machine CPUs are probably beefier than the ones running on a developer laptop
2018-09-24T22:36:46 <Justin_o> it looks like that from your gist
2018-09-24T22:36:48 <alanharnum> unfortunately as we know there's a lot of other things that can cause failure as well :/
2018-09-24T22:37:37 <Justin_o> alanharnum: strange.. maybe we can chat more about this tomorrow
2018-09-24T22:38:28 <alanharnum> yeah i'll see if I can have a more detailed look tomorrow
2018-09-24T22:41:23 <gmoss> Justin_o alanharnum: I ran the tests one more time on my local machine with the cpu throttled, and I can reproduce the bug only when that last test sequence is run in isolation. If all three UIO tests are run together, it doesn't occur. This is something someone had mentioned last week while trying to reproduce the bugs. Very curious. I guess I'm not free after all haha..
2018-09-24T22:47:40 <Justin_o> gmoss: at least you were able to reproduce it.. although it seems strange still.. anyways, i'm off now too.. talk to you all tomorrow

b'2018-09-24T07:05:45 <the-t-in-rtf> Morning @stegru and @javjarfer[m].  Just reviewing the onboarding task and wanted to confirm, JJ\'s pull to flesh out the narrator settings is the only one updating the existing solutions?
2018-09-24T07:05:52 <the-t-in-rtf> https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2714
2018-09-24T07:06:33 <the-t-in-rtf> I ask because part of my work will be to add checks for completeness, so that further onboarding will throw an error unless it includes the schema data.
2018-09-24T07:07:37 <the-t-in-rtf> My thinking is that I\'d take ownership of any existing solutions missing schema data that noone is working on.
2018-09-24T07:08:20 <the-t-in-rtf> but I\'d like to avoid a repeat of Friday, where I was also working on Narrator (my mistake)
2018-09-24T08:32:30 <the-t-in-rtf> OK, still waiting to confirm that no one else is fleshing out the legacy solutions data in win32.json.
2018-09-24T08:32:44 <the-t-in-rtf> I\'d also like to know if someone is adding schema data for the UIOptions+ settings.
2018-09-24T09:05:25 <the-t-in-rtf> OK, I hope someone else is eventually working, lots of questions.
2018-09-24T09:05:36 <the-t-in-rtf> When\'s the last time someone actually tested the Mouse Keys settings?
2018-09-24T09:05:51 <the-t-in-rtf> The key for "acceleration" appears to have completely changed in later versions.
2018-09-24T09:06:06 <the-t-in-rtf> it\'s now stored as TimeToMaximumSpeed with a different scale.
2018-09-24T09:19:46 <the-t-in-rtf> @stegru or anyone who worked on language support, I have some questions about our list of locales.
2018-09-24T09:19:50 <the-t-in-rtf> what\'s it based on, for starters?
2018-09-24T09:20:20 <the-t-in-rtf> I\'m just trying to add labels for the enumerated list of options, and struggling to find some of the ones we list, such as "en-scotland".
2018-09-24T09:20:59 <the-t-in-rtf> Intl.getCanonicalLocales
2018-09-24T09:21:03 <the-t-in-rtf> dang, copy paste
2018-09-24T09:21:09 <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/ontologies/flat.json5#L80
2018-09-24T09:24:37 <the-t-in-rtf> There\'s some odd variants on English as well that I don\'t see at least in the .net supported codes.
2018-09-24T09:24:44 <the-t-in-rtf> https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh441729.aspx?f=255&MSPPError=-2147217396
2018-09-24T09:24:55 <the-t-in-rtf> at least I can fill in most of them from there.
2018-09-24T10:17:33 <stegru> I don\'t know where the list of locales came from, the
2018-09-24T10:17:35 <stegru> the-t-in-rtf
2018-09-24T11:15:35 <jhernandez> the-t-in-rtf: hey, the locales were defined back in the cloud4all days
2018-09-24T11:16:08 <jhernandez> IIRC, we used the IETF BCP spec
2018-09-24T11:16:16 <jhernandez> and the list ... can\'t remember where it came from
2018-09-24T11:17:37 <jhernandez> and regarding "orphan" solutions, yeah, we don\'t check every solution and setting at all
2018-09-24T11:18:50 <jhernandez> at some point we had to provide solution-specific tests when a new solution was onboarded, but at that time, a lot of solutions were already onboarded in included in the solutions registry
2018-09-24T11:25:30 <jhernandez> oh, and regarding language codes, the ones included in ontologies/flat.json don\'t need to be the ones that MS supports
2018-09-24T11:26:14 <jhernandez> the ones that MS support must only be included in solution-specific ones, such as on microsoft.windows.language and things like that
2018-09-24T12:29:41 <the-t-in-rtf> Thanks, Javi.
2018-09-24T12:30:07 <the-t-in-rtf> I didn\'t necessarily think they needed to be windows, but some kind of rationale I can look up is helpful... ;)

2018-09-24T12:37:00 <jhernandez> yup
2018-09-24T12:38:59 <jhernandez> in terms of historical things related to language codes, I could find the proposal to use IETF BCP  here, https://wiki.gpii.net/w/Discussion_on_Profile_Structure#Language_Codes
2018-09-24T12:39:28 <jhernandez> not sure who was involved in this though
2018-09-24T12:51:19 <stegru> microsoft.windows.language will only contain the languages windows has language packs for

2018-09-24T13:28:23 * Bosmon3 joined the channel
2018-09-24T13:29:00 <Bosmon3> Hi there cindyli - amazing work getting all of the matchmaker sorted out over the weekend!
2018-09-24T13:30:54 <cindyli> what a relief. we should talk about details for "reset all" when you have time, Bosmon3
2018-09-24T13:32:51 <Bosmon3> cindyli - sure
2018-09-24T13:33:02 <Bosmon3> I can talk for a bit
2018-09-24T13:33:11 <Bosmon3> I think initially we just need something pretty basic
2018-09-24T13:33:24 <Bosmon3> In talking to Astea, they are expecting this to be triggered via the existing "reset" token
2018-09-24T13:33:54 <cindyli> the current "reset" performs a logout of the current key
2018-09-24T13:34:12 <Bosmon3> cindyli - right
2018-09-24T13:34:22 <Bosmon3> But in addition, there is an implementation for the old token named "reset"
2018-09-24T13:34:31 <Bosmon3> Which I think it is reasonable to repurpose for this new feature
2018-09-24T13:34:49 <cindyli> right
2018-09-24T13:34:54 <Bosmon3> But the behaviour, rather than undoing everything *within* the session, will be to reset all settings to a fixed snapshot that is encoded in some JSON file
2018-09-24T13:35:10 <Bosmon3> But for this change to be permanent - that is, it throws away any snapshot it has taken, and replaces it with these settings
2018-09-24T13:35:33 <Bosmon3> So that when this session ends, this change will not be undone
2018-09-24T13:36:02 <cindyli> sounds like "reset" won\'t logout the current key
2018-09-24T13:36:17 <Bosmon3> cindyli - well it won\'t necessarily
2018-09-24T13:36:27 <Bosmon3> But it sounds like Gregg does actually want the current session logged out as well
2018-09-24T13:36:53 <Bosmon3> We could arrange for Astea to do this separately, I don\'t think it creates too much extra complexity either way
2018-09-24T13:37:16 <Bosmon3> It is probably easier for us to do the promise sequencing on our side
2018-09-24T13:37:54 <Bosmon3> Also perhaps it is better to log out of the current session just in case any of the reset settings end up sent to autosave or something
2018-09-24T13:38:22 <Bosmon3> But I believe logging in the "reset" token will necessarily log out any session? Or is it not implemented that way currently?
2018-09-24T13:38:37 <Bosmon3> I know that "restore" is special that way, but I don\'t remember about "reset"
2018-09-24T13:38:56 <cindyli> i believe "reset" logout the current session. checking..
2018-09-24T13:40:44 <cindyli> who is nova technical? college technical team? received 2 invites from greg to have meetings with them
2018-09-24T13:40:54 <Bosmon3> cindyli - yes
2018-09-24T13:42:04 * alanharnum joined the channel
2018-09-24T13:42:46 <cindyli> Bosmon3: logout the current session is the only thing "reset" currently does.
2018-09-24T13:42:48 <cindyli> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/lifecycleManager/src/UserLogonStateChange.js#L30
2018-09-24T13:43:48 <cindyli> so i think the new "reset" will:
2018-09-24T13:43:53 <cindyli> 1. logout the current session
2018-09-24T13:44:12 <cindyli> 2. reset all other settings to a fixed snapshot
2018-09-24T13:44:35 <Bosmon3> cindyli - ok - is that really the same as this mechanism?: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/lifecycleManager/src/LifecycleManager.js#L309
2018-09-24T13:44:50 <cindyli> yes
2018-09-24T13:44:55 <Bosmon3> ok
2018-09-24T13:45:08 <Bosmon3> It\'s become a little hard to trace the logic in these files : P
2018-09-24T13:45:25 <Bosmon3> We should clean them up once we get a moment
2018-09-24T13:45:38 <Bosmon3> Perhaps when we get round to abolishing LifecycleManagerSession
2018-09-24T13:45:59 <cindyli> ok
2018-09-24T13:46:16 <Bosmon3> Oh yes, I see it now
2018-09-24T13:46:24 <Bosmon3> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/lifecycleManager/src/UserLogonRequest.js#L64
2018-09-24T13:46:28 <cindyli> right
2018-09-24T13:46:32 <Bosmon3> So all we need to do is reimplement this function
2018-09-24T13:47:20 <Bosmon3> Such that it resets the settings to a fixed snapshot encoded in a JSON file
2018-09-24T13:47:32 <cindyli> after the logout of the current session
2018-09-24T13:47:49 <Bosmon3> For a little extra credit, we can copy the version of this JSON file in the codebase into the GPII settings directory and read it from there, in case someone wants to edit it
2018-09-24T13:48:02 <Bosmon3> Yes
2018-09-24T13:49:28 <cindyli> GPII settings dir is "settingsDir" defined by journal, right
2018-09-24T13:49:53 <cindyli> this JSON file is the captured snapshots of all settings at the GPII installation, right?
2018-09-24T13:50:03 <cindyli> is -> contains
2018-09-24T13:50:23 <Bosmon3> cindyli - well right now it will be a hardcoded file
2018-09-24T13:50:46 <Bosmon3> One that just i) turns off all AT, ii) sets any scaling etc. to the defaults
2018-09-24T13:51:12 <cindyli> someone will manually create this file as Greg said in a meeting?
2018-09-24T13:51:20 <Bosmon3> right
2018-09-24T13:51:39 <Bosmon3> To start with we will just have a standard basic one written in the codebase
2018-09-24T13:51:44 <Bosmon3> In testData/something.json
2018-09-24T13:51:58 * michelled joined the channel
2018-09-24T13:53:08 <cindyli> ok, how will this file look like? i believe it will not be as complicated as what\'s recorded in https://gist.github.com/cindyli/8e362d49f44304d7619a25fd54896ea9#file-lifecyclemanager-session-model-originalsettings: https://gist.github.com/cindyli/8e362d49f44304d7619a25fd54896ea9
2018-09-24T13:53:22 <cindyli> unreadable
2018-09-24T13:53:44 <cindyli> the link content is for lifecycleManager.session.model.originalSettings
2018-09-24T13:55:03 <Bosmon3> cindyli - I guess it could look like that, if we wanted the "easy" way for the local admin to generate this was via snapshotting
2018-09-24T13:55:20 <Bosmon3> If it was just a preferences file, we would need to run it through the matchmaker, which adds complexity for us
2018-09-24T13:56:26 <cindyli> if the file content looks like session.model.originalSettings, i guess only a couple of ppl would have skills to create this file.
2018-09-24T13:57:03 <cindyli> I cannot even create it without a full understanding of win32.json
2018-09-24T13:59:11 <Bosmon3> cindyli - the system would make one at the point the first "noUser" session starts up
2018-09-24T14:00:30 <cindyli> ya, eventually. but for now, i think someone will manually create this file
2018-09-24T14:01:26 <cindyli> or I should do it now? to have a snapshotting step to create this file at the point the first "noUser" session starts up
2018-09-24T14:03:54 <Bosmon3> cindyli - to start with, let\'s just assume someone will manually create this file

2018-09-24T14:04:23 <cindyli> ok
2018-09-24T14:04:36 * colinclark joined the channel
2018-09-24T14:05:46 <cindyli> Bosmon3: why would copying this file into the GPII settings directory help someone to edit it?
2018-09-24T14:06:38 <cindyli> i thought settingsDir is only written and read by our code
2018-09-24T14:07:46 <cindyli> would a real person edit a file in there to make GPII behave differently?
2018-09-24T14:13:02 <stegru> FYI Bosmon, jhernandez - Just made a "standalone metrics" application (https://github.com/stegru/gpii-standalone-metrics). I don\'t think this is anything to worry about for now, just making you aware in case Gregg asks/mentions it.
2018-09-24T14:13:35 <Bosmon3> cindyli - well I think we will rewrite it ourselves eventually, once we implement the snapshotting
2018-09-24T14:13:58 <Bosmon3> And as a stopgap, it sounds better to invite people to hand-edit a JSON file in the settings dir than rummaging around the core code and doing it in there
2018-09-24T14:14:46 <cindyli> i see
2018-09-24T14:23:35 * michelled joined the channel
2018-09-24T14:28:31 <cindyli> Bosmon3, jhernandez, George and Danail are not online right now. as your timezone has better chance to see them online, can you inform them to start using the latest windows repo that now points to the latest universal. The universal master now has all feds-audit features merged in
2018-09-24T14:30:40 * cindyli1 joined the channel
2018-09-24T14:37:03 <Bosmon3> cindyli1 - yup, I will do
2018-09-24T14:37:17 <Bosmon3> Today is a holiday for them, and I\'ll let them know in the morning
2018-09-24T14:37:37 <cindyli1> thanks, Bosmon3
2018-09-24T14:54:43 <jhernandez> stegru: great, thanks for the heads up :)

2018-09-24T14:58:35 <jhernandez> cindyli: okay, I\'m already building ASTEA\'s branch against gpii-windows 0.3.0-dev.20180923T013348Z.2c5971f, let\'s see how it goes
2018-09-24T15:01:22 <cindyli> you are so fast. thanks, jhernandez

2018-09-24T15:31:34 <stegru> jhernandez, which installer pr did you say was ready.. reset shortcut or morphic branding?
2018-09-24T15:32:27 * michelled joined the channel
2018-09-24T15:34:26 <jhernandez> stegru: the renaming one is ready
2018-09-24T15:34:35 <stegru> ok
2018-09-24T15:34:51 <jhernandez> this is: https://github.com/GPII/gpii-wix-installer/pull/42
2018-09-24T15:35:13 <stegru> the meaning of life
2018-09-24T15:37:09 <jhernandez> for this one (https://github.com/GPII/gpii-wix-installer/pull/44), we need the bits from ASTEA\'s GPII-3302 to get merged into the branch from ASTEA that we are using to create the installers
2018-09-24T15:37:27 <jhernandez> the other day it wasn\'t there, let me check again
2018-09-24T15:39:35 <jhernandez> nope, it\'s not there yet, tomorrow I\'ll ask them to merge if possible
2018-09-24T15:42:56 <sgithens> the-t-in-rtf : the origin of rawModules vs modules in tests is in gpii-express right?
2018-09-24T15:43:42 <sgithens> if I\'m looking for docs that spell out what the different options are.  I\'m trying to figure out if I can use tests with an \'expect\' number in the same way under rawModules that I can in modules
2018-09-24T15:48:18 * michelled joined the channel
2018-09-24T15:50:09 <stegru> ok javi
2018-09-24T15:52:28 <the-t-in-rtf> @sgithens, you should be able to, all that does is prepend or append test steps to (for example) start and stop test fixtures.
2018-09-24T15:53:15 <the-t-in-rtf> and yes, it\'s in gpii-express/tests/js/lib/test-fixtures.js
2018-09-24T15:55:37 <gmoss> cindyli: here is what Justin_o found to throttle his CPU on a mac: http://www.willnolan.com/cputhrottle/cputhrottle.html
2018-09-24T15:56:03 <cindyli> nice. thanks, gmoss. will give a try
2018-09-24T15:56:15 <gmoss> not quite the same as CPU Killer which I\'m using on Windows, but it should do the trick
2018-09-24T16:14:49 <sgithens> the-t-in-rtf thanks... I think I almost have my express user test running.  I decided just to swtich back to `gpii.test.express.user.environment`. It\'s giving an error now that it can\'t find the db file... which I thought would be inherited looking at the other tests, but trying to debug it now
2018-09-24T16:15:40 <the-t-in-rtf> I\'m just coincidentallly at my computer, and am watching my son already for the evening.
