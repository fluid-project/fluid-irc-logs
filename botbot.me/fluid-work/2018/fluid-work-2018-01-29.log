2018-01-29T20:30:50 <colinclark> hiya jhung
2018-01-29T20:30:57 <jhung> hey colinclark
2018-01-29T20:31:14 <colinclark> any chance you\'ve got some free time tomorrow afternoon? :)
2018-01-29T20:31:39 <colinclark> i just had a very productive conversation with grrrero and michelled about the SNOW site, and other sites moving forward
2018-01-29T20:31:42 <jhung> colinclark: I do.
2018-01-29T20:31:59 <colinclark> and I think I need to learn a bit more about the various kinds of relationships we have (and want to have) between our wordpress themes
2018-01-29T20:32:05 <colinclark> that ol\' can of worms :)
2018-01-29T20:32:33 <jhung> Yes.
2018-01-29T20:32:41 <colinclark> 2:30 pm tomorrow?
2018-01-29T20:32:57 <jhung> Sure that sounds good.
2018-01-29T20:33:27 <colinclark> Hopefully we can, as a result of talking tomorrow, file some "aspirational" JIRAs about what kinds of things we want todo to improve our site-making experience with time
2018-01-29T20:35:16 <jhung> colinclark: agreed. There\'s much we can / should do there. I\'ll try to document some things before tomorrow\'s meeting.
2018-01-29T20:49:12 <colinclark> awesome, that\'ll be super helpful jhung

2018-01-29T15:00:12 <simonjb> hi there cindyli and Bosmon, I wanted to discuss merging https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/582 into master with you both
2018-01-29T15:00:44 <simonjb> I will make a JIRA issue similar to https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2771 to record the state of universal prior to the merge
2018-01-29T15:00:55 <simonjb> this one removes a lot of code
2018-01-29T15:01:18 <simonjb> is it good to go ahead with this merge now?
2018-01-29T15:01:24 <Bosmon> Hey there simonjb
2018-01-29T15:01:30 <Bosmon> cindyli - where did all our ontologies go?
2018-01-29T15:01:36 <simonjb> can you both help me think through any side effects?
2018-01-29T15:02:01 <simonjb> such as effects on CI or system deployments
2018-01-29T15:04:16 <Bosmon> Urgh... the entirety of privacy filtering is gone ....
2018-01-29T15:04:30 <simonjb> yes, it removes a lot
2018-01-29T15:05:05 <cindyli> Bosmon: do you mean the testData for ontologies?
2018-01-29T15:05:15 <Bosmon> cindyli - the testData *is* the ontologies!
2018-01-29T15:06:34 <cindyli> Bosmon: testData/ontologies is there
2018-01-29T15:06:55 <cindyli> do i misunderstand?
2018-01-29T15:06:59 <Bosmon> Yes ...
2018-01-29T15:07:06 <Bosmon> I guess the first discovery ontology is "unused"
2018-01-29T15:07:14 <cindyli> right
2018-01-29T15:08:34 <grrrero> michelled: Got time for a quick call?
2018-01-29T15:10:27 * jhung joined the channel
2018-01-29T15:11:34 <michelled> grrrero: for sure - in 5 minutes?
2018-01-29T15:11:38 <grrrero> Ok!

2018-01-29T15:21:48 * colinclark joined the channel
2018-01-29T15:24:01 <Bosmon> simonjb - I guess it can be merged
2018-01-29T15:25:08 <simonjb> Bosmon: do you have concerns?
2018-01-29T15:25:45 <Bosmon> simonjb - only vague and abstract ones
2018-01-29T15:26:07 <Bosmon> It\'s distressing to see so much good work by so many of us heading for the bin
2018-01-29T15:26:10 <Bosmon> But, there it is
2018-01-29T15:28:35 <simonjb> cindyli: can you think of any other systems/things that might be affected by this merge? do we need to coordinate this with any other changes elsewhere? I wasn\'t able to think of any, but it\'s a big change
2018-01-29T15:29:41 * jhung joined the channel
2018-01-29T15:30:53 <simonjb> we don\'t currently have any clients using the removed endpoints, right? for example First Discovery isn\'t a concern is it?
2018-01-29T15:31:46 <michelled> grrrero: is now good?
2018-01-29T15:31:54 <grrrero> Yep michelled call you directly?
2018-01-29T15:32:24 <michelled> yep
2018-01-29T15:33:34 <cindyli> simonjb: i don\'t think we have a deployment of the first discovery that uses removed endpoints. i checked with Steve Githens before removing them
2018-01-29T15:34:03 <cindyli> the first-discovery-server would no longer work tho: https://github.com/GPII/first-discovery-server/blob/master/src/config/oauth2.json#L9
2018-01-29T15:34:30 <simonjb> cindyli: and we decided that was ok, right?
2018-01-29T15:35:12 <cindyli> yes, simonjb, we had a discussion following Steve\'s email response. the decision was to go ahead
2018-01-29T15:35:50 <cindyli> simonjb: and i believe what\'s changed by this PR won\'t affect CI
2018-01-29T15:37:08 <simonjb> and in terms of test coverage, are we confident that the local flow manager client is working with these changes?
2018-01-29T15:37:34 <simonjb> what would be the best way for me to verify that manually?
2018-01-29T15:39:18 <simonjb> run the windows VM and start GPII with the untrusted config?
2018-01-29T15:40:36 <simonjb> gpii.config.untrusted.development.all.local.json ?
2018-01-29T15:40:46 <simonjb> cindyli ^
2018-01-29T15:46:12 <cindyli> simonjb: using that config file is ok, and this one is good too - gpii.config.cloudBased.development.all.local.json
2018-01-29T15:46:31 <cindyli> to test the endpoints provided by the cloud
2018-01-29T15:46:46 <cindyli> the change of this PR is mainly on cloud
2018-01-29T15:47:51 <simonjb> cindyli: I\'d like to make sure that the local flow manager is still happy
2018-01-29T15:48:04 <simonjb> with it\'s communication with the cloud
2018-01-29T15:48:19 <simonjb> that the cloud changes haven\'t broken the local
2018-01-29T15:48:26 <simonjb> more end-to-end
2018-01-29T15:50:16 <simonjb> thanks cindyli and Bosmon: I will do some manual testing today and will merge if good (and I will make a JIRA catpuring state of universal before merge)
2018-01-29T15:50:47 <Bosmon> simonjb - awesome, thanks!
2018-01-29T15:51:48 * kasparnet has quit
2018-01-29T15:52:15 <cindyli> simonjb: agree. i\'m not sure how to manually test the closed communication in btw the local flow manager and the cloud based flow manager. i think that should be covered by the integration test. one manually test is to start the windows VM and open a browser to test /login, /logout
2018-01-29T15:53:21 <cindyli> the manual test i did is on my own machine, start the cloud based flow manager, then test the endpoints /access_token and /untrusted-settings
2018-01-29T15:53:32 <simonjb> cindyli: yeah, that\'s what I was thinking, to log in some different users and make sure the settings are applied as expected
2018-01-29T15:53:43 <cindyli> :)
2018-01-29T15:56:16 <cindyli> simonjb: there was a merge into the universal master minutes ago, so i just updated GPII-2662
2018-01-29T15:56:41 <simonjb> thanks very much cindyli for updating!
