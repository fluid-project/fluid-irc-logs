b'2018-10-03T13:02:06 <cindyli> Bosmon: this error looks familiar. last time it was caused by a race condition between "snapset_1a" login and "noUser" login after a logout, and both "snapset_1a" and "noUser" ended up logging into the system, which caused a later failure at logging out "snapset_1a"
2018-10-03T13:02:31 <cindyli> i remembered, last time was from the journal integration test
2018-10-03T13:03:02 <cindyli> this was the fix - https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/tests/JournalIntegrationTests.js#L470-L475
2018-10-03T13:03:18 <cindyli> i will take a look at danailbd/fix/qssTests branch

2018-10-03T13:38:42 <Bosmon> stegru, dandimitrov has tried updating us to electron 3.0.2 and got a fairly familiar-looking error: https://pastebin.com/CdEAyuqU
2018-10-03T13:38:58 <Bosmon> I can\'t remember offhand what is involved in getting ref to build in the electron toolchain ....
2018-10-03T13:40:58 <stegru> I think the thing you\'re thinking of would be a different error... something to do with a version mismatch

2018-10-03T13:48:02 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: thanks for the review. What are the enumLabels used for. Want to get an idea for what to use. i.e. a simple label or something more descriptive
2018-10-03T13:48:21 <the-t-in-rtf> @Justin_o, enum describes the literal values that are accepted.
2018-10-03T13:48:30 <the-t-in-rtf> which are often like 0,1,2, shorthand
2018-10-03T13:48:42 <the-t-in-rtf> enum labels are user-facing descriptions of what each option means
2018-10-03T13:48:46 <the-t-in-rtf> and generally fairly short
2018-10-03T13:48:50 <the-t-in-rtf> like "on", "off"
2018-10-03T13:49:01 <the-t-in-rtf> or "with sprinkles", "without sprinkles"
2018-10-03T13:49:12 <the-t-in-rtf> I tend to title case them, but that\'s just style.
2018-10-03T13:49:27 <Justin_o> so for example the contrast themes.. we have "bw" is "black on white" sufficient
2018-10-03T13:49:31 <the-t-in-rtf> "Firehose Enabled", "Firehose Disabled"
2018-10-03T13:49:44 <Justin_o> or should it be more like "black foreground colour on a white background"
2018-10-03T13:49:50 <the-t-in-rtf> I would prefer "Black on White" for consistency with my other work, but that\'s me.
2018-10-03T13:49:55 <the-t-in-rtf> The longer is probably fine.
2018-10-03T13:50:10 <the-t-in-rtf> I think "colour" can be safely omitted from that example.
2018-10-03T13:50:18 <Justin_o> okay thanks
2018-10-03T13:50:40 <the-t-in-rtf> I sent my preference for "Black on White" as an example, I didn\'t mean that I preferred the short version.
2018-10-03T13:51:05 <the-t-in-rtf> only that I prefer title case.
2018-10-03T13:51:22 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: okay thanks, that last part was my next question

2018-10-03T16:31:55 <Justin_o> was it from npm test and if so how were you able to narrow it down. I\'m not seeing such a clear error message
2018-10-03T16:32:31 <Bosmon> Yes it was just in npm test
2018-10-03T16:34:29 <Justin_o> Bosmon: my log says

2018-10-03T16:34:42 <Justin_o> how did you get it to show the actual output?
2018-10-03T16:34:58 <Bosmon> I think I managed to jam the browser partway through the test and then look in its console

2018-10-03T16:47:27 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: by the way, I\'m finding that if I update to the latest testem v2.12.0 in the gpii-chrome-extension repo that the npm tests just halt. It looks like chrome doesn\'t launch. Is that a known issue?
2018-10-03T16:52:52 <the-t-in-rtf> no.
2018-10-03T16:53:11 <the-t-in-rtf> let me try it with gpii-testem itself, just a sec.

2018-10-03T16:54:15 <the-t-in-rtf> I can easily confirm whether the package itself works.
2018-10-03T16:54:18 <the-t-in-rtf> it\'s no trouble.

2018-10-03T16:55:57 <the-t-in-rtf> The tests for gpii-testem pass with the new testem.  I\'m in the toddler-heavy portion of the evening, so my replies may be slow in comoing.
2018-10-03T16:55:58 <the-t-in-rtf> coming
2018-10-03T16:56:12 <the-t-in-rtf> I believe you can  use a launch option instead of skipping everything else.
2018-10-03T16:56:13 <Justin_o> no worries

2018-10-03T17:19:26 <the-t-in-rtf> one thought, have you tried running Testem in non-CI mode?
2018-10-03T17:19:35 <the-t-in-rtf> it\'s pretty helpful in diagnosing problems
2018-10-03T17:19:52 <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. node node_modules/testem/testem.js --file path/to/testem.js
2018-10-03T17:20:05 <the-t-in-rtf> you then just open it in a browser.

2018-10-03T17:37:46 <sgithens> the-t-in-rtf: Not sur eif you saw this earlier one but I wanted to double check my understanding: for gpii-express-user\'s test environment, everything is running in the original node process that started the tests correct? The express listener port, the pouchdb listener port, the mail server port.  None of those test servers are being spawned or exec\'d into separate processes or threads right?
2018-10-03T17:39:28 <the-t-in-rtf> ask alan about the logs

2018-10-03T19:44:17 <sgithens> the-t-in-rtf Bosmon : Ok, I finally figured out whats happening.  Since my test uses the promise-based function api call that uses a DataSource, we had mentioned before that it should probably jqUnit.stop() and and start() since it has to make a call. However, that was the right idea, but not enough. I need actually pause the fluid IoC sequence steps.  The issue is that they were blowing right through everything, and then
2018-10-03T19:44:17 <sgithens> de-provisioning the pouchdb instance at the end, which is why I could sort of connect to it, but not actually see any database file.  I tried putting it at the top of the sequence, followed by a bunch of random webdriver sequences, and it works there because there is enough leeway.  I\'m guessing there is already a mechanism for doing this since the sequences stop, or at least wait for the webdriver calls, so I\'ll go look
2018-10-03T19:44:17 <sgithens> at the docs for it again.

2018-10-03T07:35:53 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: Hey, Antranig! I did some further investigation in the hanging "volume" test about which we talked yesterday.
2018-10-03T07:36:44 <georgitodorov> After taking a closer look at the log file on my machine, I saw that the "event": "solution-failed" was also present there
2018-10-03T07:37:55 <georgitodorov> However, I saw that on a VM the "volume" setting was not present at all in the PSP
2018-10-03T07:39:01 <georgitodorov> The idea in my test was that the volume setting was the first one in the PSP and the magnifier was the second. The test hangs because different events are fired when changing these two settings. And the volume event never arrives
2018-10-03T07:39:33 <georgitodorov> On my machine though the volume setting is present in the PSP. I also tried uninstalling JAWS and the setting was still there
2018-10-03T07:40:06 <georgitodorov> So I guess something on the Core\'s side is determining whether a setting is applicable to the given machine and if not, it is not sent at all via the PSPChannel
2018-10-03T07:41:10 <the-t-in-rtf> @georgitodorov, you also have to reset pouch when you pull down new settings and solutions data
2018-10-03T07:41:22 <the-t-in-rtf> it makes it appear that data is there when it\'s not or vice versa
2018-10-03T07:41:34 <the-t-in-rtf> I assume you\'ve been doing that on each refresh?
2018-10-03T07:41:51 <the-t-in-rtf> or are you running in another mode that doesn\'t use pouch?
2018-10-03T07:43:02 <georgitodorov> the-t-in-rtf: I am using the "gpii.config.untrusted.development.dynamicDR.all.local" configuration and just did a reset. The volume setting is still there on my native Windows 10 machine
2018-10-03T07:48:04 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: I can rewrite the test to use a different setting from a different snapset (e.g. "Cursor Size" or "Self voicing") but I am not sure whether there is a bigger problem and hence if this is the correct solution.

2018-10-03T08:16:28 <Bosmon> Hi georgitodorov - you should not be using the dynamicDR configuration for your tests because this will lead the test results to be machine-dependent
2018-10-03T08:17:07 <Bosmon> But indeed we should look into why the dynamicDR reports the volume solution as installed when it is not
2018-10-03T08:18:15 <jhernandez> Bosmon: it\'s being reported because the dynamic DR finds the "alwaysInstalled" policy in com.microsoft.windows.volumeControl
2018-10-03T08:18:29 <Bosmon> jhernandez - right
2018-10-03T08:18:58 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: Okay, there was some confusion about which config we had to use for the tests and I remember changing it on purpose.
2018-10-03T08:20:24 <Bosmon> We only introduced this solution so that the PSP would display the correct controls for some snapsets
2018-10-03T08:20:24 <Bosmon> It has never actually been implemented
2018-10-03T08:20:24 <Bosmon> It\'s still not clear though why the use of the volume setting causes a failure, it should just act as a mock
2018-10-03T08:20:24 <Bosmon> You say "The test hangs because different events are fired when changing these two settings. And the volume event never arrives"
2018-10-03T08:20:24 <Bosmon> Can you give more detail here?
2018-10-03T08:20:24 <jhernandez> but yeah, the dynamicDR shouldn\'t be used in tests
2018-10-03T08:20:25 <georgitodorov> Should we be using "gpii.config.development.all.local.json5" for the tests or something else?
2018-10-03T08:23:22 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: The test is trying to click on the volume control input but instead (because this input is missing), it is actually clicking on the magnifier\'s input
2018-10-03T08:24:05 <georgitodorov> The root of the hanging of the test is that there is 1 instead of 2 settings present in the PSP
2018-10-03T08:24:34 <georgitodorov> But I can use a different snapset and rewrite the test
2018-10-03T08:24:36 <jhernandez> georgitodorov: what user are you keying-in for that test? (if any)
2018-10-03T08:25:05 <georgitodorov> jhernandez: "multi_context"
2018-10-03T08:27:20 * the-t-in-rtf joined the channel
2018-10-03T08:27:22 <jhernandez> the control "must" be there
2018-10-03T08:27:33 <jhernandez> (the one for the volume)
2018-10-03T08:28:26 <jhernandez> as far as I can see, everything is in place, so I\'m not sure why you are not getting such control
2018-10-03T08:29:40 <georgitodorov> jhernandez: You are trying with a VM, right?
2018-10-03T08:29:45 <jhernandez> georgitodorov: yes
2018-10-03T08:30:11 <jhernandez> hold a sec, booting up my vm now
2018-10-03T08:30:11 <georgitodorov> jhernandez: Which configuration are you using?
2018-10-03T08:30:16 <jhernandez> will check it here
2018-10-03T08:31:13 <jhernandez> I\'m running the gpii-app with this universal config: gpii.config.untrusted.development.dynamicDR.all.local
2018-10-03T08:31:25 <jhernandez> this is, all running local + dynamicDR
2018-10-03T08:32:25 <georgitodorov> jhernandez: As Bosmon said, the dynamic DR leads to this machine-specific result
2018-10-03T08:32:30 <jhernandez> yes
2018-10-03T08:32:39 <georgitodorov> it appears that on your VM the setting is supported for some reason
2018-10-03T08:33:49 <jhernandez> georgitodorov: I can confirm that the volume control is there in the PSP
2018-10-03T08:33:50 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: Two questions. 1. Should we be using  "gpii.config.development.all.local.json5" config for all tests? 2. Should I rewrite the test to alter a different setting (e.g. Cursor Size)?
2018-10-03T08:34:17 <jhernandez> I\'m running the gpii with npm start and with the universal config I pasted above
2018-10-03T08:35:49 <jhernandez> georgitodorov: I think that for the tests you must use gpii.config.development.all.local.json5 and provide a fixed static device reporter data via an installedSolutions.json5 file
2018-10-03T08:37:24 <jhernandez> in any case, let\'s see what Bosmon thinks
2018-10-03T08:37:38 <Bosmon> jhernandez - you are right, yes
2018-10-03T08:37:48 <Bosmon> The dynamicDR configuration is appropriate for production
2018-10-03T08:37:56 <Bosmon> And the tests should use a static deviceReporter
2018-10-03T08:38:20 <Bosmon> And as a result you shouldn\'t need to rewrite the tests
2018-10-03T08:38:56 <Bosmon> However it would still be good to know what the cause of the failure is - is it simply that the test has been written to not expect the volume control to be there?
2018-10-03T08:39:27 <Bosmon> It\'s odd that we get the "solution-failed" event back from the metrics, since this solution is a mock for which every action should succeed
2018-10-03T08:40:39 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: The test expects both the volume and the magnifier to be there.
2018-10-03T08:40:57 <georgitodorov> But the volume is not present at all and actually my test is not altering the value of the volume setting
2018-10-03T08:41:15 <Bosmon> georgitodorov - ok, well in that case moving to the static device reporter shouldn\'t cause a change in this behaviour
2018-10-03T08:41:30 <georgitodorov> The volume failure comes from keying in
2018-10-03T08:41:41 <Bosmon> ok, I see
2018-10-03T08:41:48 <jhernandez> georgitodorov: I\'m not having that behavior with dynamicDR
2018-10-03T08:41:57 <jhernandez> let me try with a different config
2018-10-03T08:49:34 <Bosmon> Hmm
2018-10-03T08:49:41 <Bosmon> I think there is actually a bug in the noSettingsHandler : P
2018-10-03T08:51:30 * the-t-in-rtf has quit
2018-10-03T08:53:47 <jhernandez> ok
2018-10-03T08:53:49 <Bosmon> Yes, this is interesting, the metrics system makes its own independent check as to whether the solution was applied by looking into the session state
2018-10-03T08:54:02 <jhernandez> first thing, the solution-failed happens with both configs
2018-10-03T08:54:06 <Bosmon> And because of the bug in the noSettingsHandler, it correctly determines that it wasn\'t
2018-10-03T08:54:10 <Bosmon> Yes, this is what I would expect
2018-10-03T08:54:15 <jhernandez> but I\'m getting the volume control
2018-10-03T08:55:02 <Bosmon> And I think the other issue is then, because of this bug, the session state never updates and therefore no settings control is emitted
2018-10-03T08:55:15 <Bosmon> I will write this up and ask cindy to look at this later today
2018-10-03T08:55:20 <jhernandez> only when using the gpii.config.untrusted.development.dynamicDR.all.local
2018-10-03T08:55:31 <Bosmon> In the meantime you can move on to the next bug in the test set
2018-10-03T08:56:14 <jhernandez> if I use gpii.config.development.all.local.json5 I don\'t even get the morphic tray icon at all
2018-10-03T08:56:27 <jhernandez> JFYI

2018-10-03T09:05:10 * the-t-in-rtf joined the channel
2018-10-03T09:09:52 <Bosmon> OK, I have written up https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3422
2018-10-03T09:11:01 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: Thank you!
2018-10-03T09:11:32 <georgitodorov> jhernandez: I am getting the same result - the tray icon is not displayed at all. Investigating now
2018-10-03T09:11:42 <Bosmon> It should only be a small amount of work, in the meantime we can look at the other causes of test failures, I think cindy produced a very good writeup last night
2018-10-03T09:16:22 <jhernandez> Bosmon: thanks for writing up GPII-3422
2018-10-03T09:17:11 <Bosmon> If only we could still say **DAMN YOU, KASPARNETTT**
2018-10-03T09:17:14 <Bosmon> I miss him
2018-10-03T09:17:14 <jhernandez> yes, I think that this is the very first time we are really calling and passing prefs to the noSettingsHandler
2018-10-03T09:17:21 <jhernandez> heh
2018-10-03T09:17:39 <jhernandez> same here, missing him a lot
2018-10-03T09:20:22 * jhernandez has quit
2018-10-03T09:20:52 * jhernandez joined the channel
2018-10-03T10:15:20 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: Okay, here is next thing which is not working as expected
2018-10-03T10:15:38 <georgitodorov> When using the static instead of the dynamic DR for the tests, the key out operation fails
2018-10-03T10:15:48 <georgitodorov> I get the following error: "Got logout request from user snapset_1a, but the user noUser is logged in. So ignoring the request."
2018-10-03T11:05:29 * Justin_o joined the channel
2018-10-03T11:44:08 <Bosmon> georgitodorov - is this checked in to your branch?
2018-10-03T11:44:19 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: yes
2018-10-03T12:01:18 * georgitodorov has quit

2018-10-03T12:45:10 <Justin_o> Bosmon, jhernandez: has anything changed with logging in users. I\'m trying to test out UIO+ in the windows vm, but can\'t seem to get anything logged in
2018-10-03T12:45:37 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I assume you mean via the HTTP endpoints
2018-10-03T12:45:42 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes
2018-10-03T12:46:07 <Bosmon> Is this with the most recent gpii-windows build that is in npm?
2018-10-03T12:46:34 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i\'m just using the windows repo and running vagrant.. is there a better way to get a windows vm?
2018-10-03T12:46:53 <Bosmon> That should be fine
2018-10-03T12:47:43 <Justin_o> Bosmon: maybe the url I\'m using is wrong.. i used "localhost:8081/users/uioPlusCommon/login"
2018-10-03T12:47:55 <Bosmon> And what do you see in the logs
2018-10-03T12:48:05 <Justin_o> nothign
2018-10-03T12:48:13 <Justin_o> it doesn\'t seem to be reaching GPII at all
2018-10-03T12:48:33 <Bosmon> Justin_o - typo, I imagine
2018-10-03T12:48:39 <Bosmon> It should be /user/x/login
2018-10-03T12:48:50 <Bosmon> https://wiki.gpii.net/w/Flow_Manager#Login_.28local_only.29
2018-10-03T12:49:05 <Justin_o> that doesn\'t seem to do anything either
2018-10-03T12:49:28 <Justin_o> in chrome it just says "Waiting for localhost..."
2018-10-03T12:50:30 <Justin_o> Bosmon: I tried in firefox too, same problem
2018-10-03T12:50:59 <Justin_o> Bosmon: and nothing showing up in powershell to indicate that the server was pinged
2018-10-03T12:51:14 <Justin_o> is there a user that should definitely work that i could try?
2018-10-03T12:55:30 <Bosmon> Hi Justin_o - I just tested it out and it works fine for me
2018-10-03T12:55:38 <Bosmon> I tried logging in and out with sammy and uioPlusCommon
2018-10-03T12:55:50 * cindyli joined the channel
2018-10-03T12:55:53 <Bosmon> Perhaps you have some other application running on port 8081, or a stray copy of the application in memory?
2018-10-03T12:56:05 <Justin_o> Bosmon: very strange.. i went to restart gpii.. hit ctrl-c and things started working.. but i had to do the same thing after trying to logout
2018-10-03T12:56:08 <Justin_o> so seems something is getting stuck
2018-10-03T12:56:22 <Justin_o> Bosmon: this is a fresh windows vm
2018-10-03T12:56:28 <Bosmon> Justin_o - perhaps you had blocked the application\'s console output by selecting some text
2018-10-03T12:56:44 <Bosmon> If you do this on Windows, it will jam all I/O for the process
2018-10-03T12:57:06 <Justin_o> really!?
2018-10-03T12:57:12 <Justin_o> maybe that was it.. let me try again
2018-10-03T12:57:22 <Bosmon> Justin_o - it\'s a bit astonishing, but this is true :)
2018-10-03T12:57:36 <Bosmon> A bizarre hangover of Windows\' 30-yr-old I/O infrastructure
2018-10-03T12:58:24 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i think that might have been it because things seem to be working now..
2018-10-03T12:58:38 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, it is a thing you have to be very careful about
2018-10-03T12:58:45 <Bosmon> Although doing it deliberately can occasionally be useful : P
2018-10-03T12:58:49 <jhernandez> Justin_o: I think you\'re just hitting the evil "select mode in powershell/command prompt"
2018-10-03T12:58:59 <Bosmon> Hi there cindyli - so we have a new bug report from Astea this morning :)
2018-10-03T12:59:09 <jhernandez> :P
2018-10-03T12:59:30 <Bosmon> cindyli - if you can check out the current today\'s status in danailbd/fix/qssTests of gpii-app
2018-10-03T12:59:42 <Bosmon> Something very odd happens when invoking the lifecycleManager\'s "performLogout" method
2018-10-03T12:59:47 <Justin_o> jhernandez: evil indeed
2018-10-03T13:00:16 <Bosmon> Despite the fact there is genuinely a user logged on, the method returns in failure with "Got logout request from user snapset_1a, but the user noUser is logged in. So ignoring the request"
