b'2018-09-13T15:53:52 <jhernandez> or was this just the attempt to fix the values for the hi-dpi screens for the demo?
2018-09-13T15:54:23 <jhernandez> (and make the tests happy)
2018-09-13T15:54:26 <jhernandez> ?
2018-09-13T15:54:59 <stegru> yes, I think the windows one also needs to be in - I\'m not sure why it isn\'t, so let me check
2018-09-13T15:56:19 <stegru> yes, there\'s nothing wrong with it, from what i can see
2018-09-13T15:57:08 <stegru> no wait.. i was looking at universal
2018-09-13T15:57:24 <stegru> oh i was supposed to
2018-09-13T15:57:36 <stegru> everything is ok
2018-09-13T15:58:42 <stegru> without the universal pr merge, dpi will break
2018-09-13T16:01:10 <stegru> it\'s mostly changes to preferences.. making them work with the new numbering of dpi. apart from a test, there\'s no code change
2018-09-13T16:06:24 <jhernandez> windows one it\'s in
2018-09-13T16:08:41 <jhernandez> so you\'re saying that we need the universal portion as well, isn\'t it?
2018-09-13T16:10:51 <jhernandez> stegru: ^
2018-09-13T16:11:04 <stegru> yes
2018-09-13T16:12:18 <jhernandez> ok, correct me if I\'m wrong but, if we use current windows/master against current universal/master we will get test failures, isn\'t it?
2018-09-13T16:13:03 <jhernandez> will test it right away
2018-09-13T16:14:05 <stegru> yes, I think it might fail
2018-09-13T16:14:19 <jhernandez> stegru: btw (and unrelated), do you have an npm account? if not, it would be great if you create one, just in case we need you to produce dev releases of any of our gpii components
2018-09-13T16:14:28 <stegru> no, i don\'t
2018-09-13T16:14:35 <jhernandez> ok, got it (will test then)
2018-09-13T16:15:50 <jhernandez> okay, no rush, but do create one when you find the time - I think that Bosmon would need to add you to the gpii organization
2018-09-13T16:16:26 <stegru> right
2018-09-13T16:17:05 <Bosmon> Easy enough

2018-09-13T16:22:02 <Bosmon> It\'s done
2018-09-13T16:23:01 <Bosmon> gtirloni et al - we used to pin npm versions because they behave badly when used internal gpii/node_modules directories together with git-sourced dependencies
2018-09-13T16:23:11 <Bosmon> After we stopped using git-sourced dependences the problem went away
2018-09-13T16:29:00 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks for clearing that up
2018-09-13T16:47:03 <jhernandez> stegru: just tested windows/master and there are no failures
2018-09-13T16:48:23 <jhernandez> so I think we should decide on whether we need (or want) https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/643 to be merged or not

2018-09-13T17:48:02 <Justin_o> jhernandez: hello.. wonder if you might have any ideas on how to fix this. I recently updated to the latest LTS version of node v8.12.0 Now the web socket tests in UIO+ are failing. Seems that the web sockets aren\'t connecting to the test server.

2018-09-13T18:57:51 <gmoss> Justin_o: I\'m going to leave out the work of getting the multilingual functionality into the separated panel of the Using Grades example, for now. I\'ve spun it off into FLUID-6341: https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6341
2018-09-13T18:58:11 <gmoss> I\'ve left it a little broad intentionally
2018-09-13T19:04:13 <Justin_o> gmoss: thanks for filing the new JIRA
2018-09-13T19:04:55 <gmoss> no problem at all Justin_o. I\'ve added it to our board so we don\'t lose track of it
2018-09-13T19:07:41 <Justin_o> thanks that\'s a good idea

2018-09-13T20:10:19 <gmoss> Bosmon: I believe I\'m encountering a case of the bug reported in FLUID-5633, and I\'ve left a comment. cindyli has taken her leave for the day, it seems, but if you have a moment, could you let me know if I\'ve missed anything or if this is indeed a case of the same bug cropping up again?
2018-09-13T20:10:37 <gmoss> https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5633
2018-09-13T20:12:35 * cindyli joined the channel
2018-09-13T20:14:11 <gmoss> cindyli: ^^^
2018-09-13T20:18:26 <cindyli> what error do you get, gmoss
2018-09-13T20:19:13 <cindyli> and on which test in the sequence?
2018-09-13T20:23:31 <gmoss> cindyli: the same error described in the jira, "Cannot read property \'execute\' of undefined" and I believe after the last item in the sequence. When debugging it showed five items in the sequence but it was attempting to access at position 5, i.e. out of bounds. This seems very close to the issue in the jira
2018-09-13T20:25:28 <cindyli> gmoss: i\'m thinking if it\'s possible to get rid of the first listener binding for "{prefsEditorBaseTest prefsEditor messageLoader}.events.onResourcesLoaded" by checking "defaultLocale" at the 2nd test in the sequence with the "onReady" event
2018-09-13T20:25:43 <cindyli> as a temp work around of the problem
2018-09-13T20:31:40 <gmoss> cindyli: that did fix the problem for now, thanks!
2018-09-13T20:31:50 <gmoss> I believe I still have found a case of that bug continuing to exist, though
2018-09-13T20:33:01 <gmoss> Am I correct in thinking that the expected behaviour is that the first listener will unbind after it has been handled, and that the second time around (sequence position 5) should be bound as if it were any other event?
2018-09-13T20:33:18 <gmoss> that\'s what I expected at least haha :)
2018-09-13T20:37:08 <cindyli> that\'s what i expected too :)
2018-09-13T20:43:43 <Bosmon> gmoss, cindyli - it\'s more likely to be FLUID-5502 rather than FLUID-5633
2018-09-13T20:43:59 <Bosmon> SInce my feeling was that we were likely to have flushed out all instances of the latter
2018-09-13T20:44:42 <Bosmon> Well ok
2018-09-13T20:44:45 <Bosmon> I see you are right
2018-09-13T20:44:54 <Bosmon> THere must be a further case we have forgotten about
2018-09-13T20:46:15 <Bosmon> I guess multi-component selectors are quite lightly tested
2018-09-13T20:46:22 <gmoss> Bosmon: I can confirm that adding a call to fluid.identity() between the listeners does not solve the issue, assuming that would stop the bug in 5502 from presenting
2018-09-13T20:46:47 <Bosmon> gmoss - yes well you have properly alternated active and passive fixtures anyway, so FLUID-5502 isn\'t relevant
2018-09-13T20:46:57 <Bosmon> Amazingly there must be a 5th unpatched subcase of FLUID-5633
2018-09-13T20:47:16 <Bosmon> What a minefield of bugs this facility is, I\'m glad our community is small enough that we can encounter them gradually :)
2018-09-13T20:47:18 <gmoss> I\'m not sure how to feel about this haha
2018-09-13T20:48:02 <gmoss> but I\'m glad our community is here to work on the bugs as we find them
2018-09-13T20:48:13 <Bosmon> Sure
2018-09-13T20:48:16 <Bosmon> It\'s better than many cases
2018-09-13T20:48:22 <Bosmon> The community will look at this bug over the weekend :)
2018-09-13T20:48:33 <gmoss> excellent, thank you!
2018-09-13T20:48:55 <gmoss> in the meantime, I will use cindyli\'s fix
2018-09-13T20:49:26 <Bosmon> gmoss - it would be interesting to see if the issue is also resolved by removing the first part of the selector
2018-09-13T20:49:55 <Bosmon> That is, by having it read just the same as the one in the 5th sequence element
2018-09-13T20:49:56 <gmoss> Bosmon: the first part of the first selector?
2018-09-13T20:50:00 <gmoss> trying..
2018-09-13T20:50:04 <Bosmon> Cool, thanks
2018-09-13T20:50:34 <gmoss> it yields an entirely different error, and one which I\'ve encountered a number of times
2018-09-13T20:50:39 <Bosmon> !
2018-09-13T20:50:48 <Bosmon> Oh yes
2018-09-13T20:50:49 <Bosmon> I know
2018-09-13T20:50:52 <gmoss> the first time I refer to {prefsEditor}, I have to specify its parent
2018-09-13T20:50:53 <Bosmon> It forces construction of the component
2018-09-13T20:51:06 <gmoss> but only the first time
2018-09-13T20:51:09 <Bosmon> Yes
2018-09-13T20:51:15 <Bosmon> Ok, what happens if you leave out the 2nd component
2018-09-13T20:51:28 <Bosmon> I assume that "messageLoader" is still actually unique in the tree
2018-09-13T20:51:38 <gmoss> "Cannot read property \'execute\' of undefined"
2018-09-13T20:51:51 <gmoss> {messageLoader} is unique in the tree iirc, yes
2018-09-13T20:52:10 <Bosmon> You get the overrun if you leave out the 2nd component too?
2018-09-13T20:52:17 <gmoss> there\'s a templateLoader, and they are both fluid.resourceLoader
2018-09-13T20:52:19 <gmoss> yes
2018-09-13T20:52:23 <Bosmon> Fascinating
2018-09-13T20:52:26 <gmoss> {prefsEditorBaseTest messageLoader}
2018-09-13T20:52:32 <gmoss> that\'s what you meant, correct?
2018-09-13T20:52:41 <Bosmon> Yes, that\'s what I mean
2018-09-13T20:52:52 <Bosmon> You aren\'t by some tiny chance working with some crufty unpatched version of Infusion?
2018-09-13T20:53:28 <gmoss> it\'s up to date with master, I believe
2018-09-13T20:53:48 <gmoss> I fetched this morning, but I\'ll check again to be 100% sure
2018-09-13T20:53:58 <Bosmon> Ok, that\'s fine
2018-09-13T20:54:00 <Bosmon> Very odd
2018-09-13T20:55:19 <gmoss> there were some commits from Justin_o\'s PR earlier today but that didn\'t affect the issue
2018-09-13T20:55:24 <Bosmon> OK
2018-09-13T20:55:44 <Bosmon> Would you be able to check in a failing version of your code under a branch named for this JIRA?
2018-09-13T20:56:01 <Bosmon> It would make it a lot easier to make a failing test case since I can\'t really guess at the failure mechanism
2018-09-13T20:56:23 <gmoss> named for FLUID-5633, that is?
2018-09-13T20:56:27 <Bosmon> Yes
2018-09-13T20:56:33 <gmoss> certainly. I\'ll do that now
2018-09-13T20:56:38 <Bosmon> Cheers
2018-09-13T20:56:40 <Bosmon> Thanks, gmoss
2018-09-13T20:56:45 <gmoss> thank you, Bosmon!
2018-09-13T21:03:04 <gmoss> Bosmon: I\'ve commented on the Jira with a link to the new branch - https://github.com/BlueSlug/infusion/tree/FLUID-5633
2018-09-13T21:03:16 <Bosmon> gmoss - awesome, thanks
2018-09-13T21:03:34 <gmoss> I hope you can reproduce the bug!

2018-09-13T10:08:12 <stegru> hello
2018-09-13T10:08:22 <jhernandez> quick question, have you seen this before? https://pastebin.com/JbCSUHmc
2018-09-13T10:08:39 <jhernandez> that\'s when creating the installer
2018-09-13T10:08:54 <stegru> never seen anything like that
2018-09-13T10:09:08 <stegru> but I\'m guessing it\'s because the path is too long
2018-09-13T10:09:18 <jhernandez> yeah
2018-09-13T10:09:21 <jhernandez> me too
2018-09-13T10:10:03 <jhernandez> in any case, looks like there\'s some redundancy going on
2018-09-13T10:10:58 <jhernandez> C:\\installer\\packager\\morphic-app-win32-ia32\\resources\\app\

2018-09-13T10:11:29 <stegru> oh yes
2018-09-13T10:12:15 <jhernandez> well rather than redundancy, circular dependencies
2018-09-13T10:13:37 <stegru> is this feds-audit?
2018-09-13T10:14:08 <stegru> oh.. i bet it\'s due to "morphic" being a little longer than "gpii"

2018-09-13T10:19:03 <jhernandez> heh, really?
2018-09-13T10:19:07 <jhernandez> let me test that

2018-09-13T10:20:49 <stegru> but, I don\'t think this will help when gpii is installed
2018-09-13T10:21:15 <stegru> it will be better to fix the problem
2018-09-13T10:22:45 <stegru> nice.. it works after you log-in again
2018-09-13T10:23:36 <jhernandez> hmm
2018-09-13T10:50:03 <jhernandez> well, it crashes after applying the fix, "heat.exe : error HEAT5059: The file \'C:\\installer\\temp\\Morphic\\windows\\resources\\app\

2018-09-13T10:50:22 <jhernandez> even though I change the name to be just "morphic"
2018-09-13T10:54:28 <the-t-in-rtf> I think I need to update gpii-grunt-mdjson-lint to make gpii-grunt-lint-all a dev dependency
2018-09-13T10:54:40 <the-t-in-rtf> it\'s super perverse that it\'s resolving itself that way.
2018-09-13T10:55:01 <the-t-in-rtf> I mean, it\'s depending on a package that depends on it and picking up its own code from there.
2018-09-13T10:55:20 <the-t-in-rtf> but it may also be that we need to use the loadNpmTasksProperly function to help grunt suck less.
2018-09-13T10:55:36 <the-t-in-rtf> Let\'s try the first thing first.
2018-09-13T10:56:24 <jhernandez> the-t-in-rtf: I agree, it\'s an insane npm resolution
2018-09-13T10:57:44 <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/GPII/gpii-grunt-lint-all/blob/master/src/load-npm-tasks-properly.js#L9
2018-09-13T10:57:57 <the-t-in-rtf> you already have access to that in any package that uses gpii-grunt-lint-all

2018-09-13T11:08:36 <the-t-in-rtf> I will create a dev release for you to test in a few minutes.
2018-09-13T11:09:02 <the-t-in-rtf> I have to do it twice, update and dev release gpii-grunt-mdjson-lint, and then update and dev release gpii-grunt-lint-all, so it\'ll be a bit.
2018-09-13T11:10:07 <the-t-in-rtf> especially if grunt decides to be grunt along the way.
2018-09-13T11:12:15 <jhernandez> heh
2018-09-13T11:12:20 <jhernandez> thanks the-t-in-rtf!
2018-09-13T11:12:48 <the-t-in-rtf> so, personal question, have you ever used one of those guitar->midi devices?
2018-09-13T11:12:58 <the-t-in-rtf> Just wondering how you\'d like playing one of my setups with your guitar.
2018-09-13T11:12:59 <the-t-in-rtf> ;)
2018-09-13T11:20:32 <the-t-in-rtf> OK, seems to work, try this version of gpii-grunt-lint-all, blow away node_modules, etc.

2018-09-13T11:25:22 <jhernandez> the-t-in-rtf: oh, great, thanks for the quick dev release! :)
2018-09-13T11:25:45 <jhernandez> and no, never used any guitar->midi thing before
2018-09-13T11:25:53 <the-t-in-rtf> oh, we may have to work that out then.
2018-09-13T11:26:06 <jhernandez> but yeah, why not
2018-09-13T11:26:07 <the-t-in-rtf> just imagine playing a gospel choir with  your guitar
2018-09-13T11:27:48 <jhernandez> even though it\'s true that there zillions of different pedals, I\'ve always thought that it would be better to have a bunch of them at once, running on a RaspberryPi thing or the like
2018-09-13T11:28:16 <the-t-in-rtf> or you could just use a DAW once you get the MIDI pickup.
2018-09-13T11:28:24 <jhernandez> yes
2018-09-13T11:29:07 <jhernandez> there really nice midi pickups out there, but I tried one once and didn\'t like it too much
2018-09-13T11:29:16 <jhernandez> probably it wasn\'t a good one
2018-09-13T11:29:56 <jhernandez> but I really like the real sound of the guitar and a nice tube amp, that\'s all I need
2018-09-13T11:31:49 <the-t-in-rtf> I understand.
2018-09-13T11:32:08 <jhernandez> there are guitar players that splits the line and takes one into a computer, they apply whatever effect to the signal and send it back to the main line all the way up through the amp
2018-09-13T11:32:24 <jhernandez> and I really like this idea
2018-09-13T11:41:33 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, for the pull, do please try the new version and let me know how it goes.
2018-09-13T11:42:29 <the-t-in-rtf> depending on where you are you may need a little help adjusting your grunt globs.
2018-09-13T11:49:45 <jhernandez> the-t-in-rtf: I would need to push the update through 3 repos, but I\'m testing if I\'m getting the same circular thing by just pulling universal

2018-09-13T12:02:00 <jhernandez> nope, it\'s only when npm installing from gpii-app
2018-09-13T12:02:45 <jhernandez> just bumped the grunt-gpii-lint-all in gpii-app, let\'s see what I end up with
2018-09-13T12:03:18 <jhernandez> btw, the-t-in-rtf check out this guy\'s set up https://youtu.be/JAMijOtsZvY?t=12m46s
2018-09-13T12:07:54 <jhernandez> ok, looks like 1.0.5-dev.20180913T111528Z.0b48f94 made the trick
2018-09-13T12:07:59 <jhernandez> awesome!
2018-09-13T12:08:01 <jhernandez> :)

2018-09-13T12:10:25 <the-t-in-rtf> that video was worth it just for the Keith McMillen foot pedal.
2018-09-13T12:10:40 <the-t-in-rtf> I plan to make something similar with the MS Assistive controller.

2018-09-13T12:57:20 <Justin_o> alanharnum: hello
2018-09-13T12:58:14 <Justin_o> i\'m looking into the issue of the prepare step not running for the FLUID-6338 PR. I updated my local vagrant and ran vagrant up, but it doesn\'t look like the prepare step was run there either
2018-09-13T12:58:36 <Justin_o> so it looks like it\'s not exclusive to CI anyways
2018-09-13T12:59:15 <jhernandez> the-t-in-rtf: heh, yeah, the foot pedal it\'s a real deal thing
2018-09-13T13:00:29 <jhernandez> and yes, you can see the kind of things guitarists are doing these days. most of the time we just want a real and warm guitar-amp sound while "effects" are just for specific moments
2018-09-13T13:00:32 <Justin_o> alanharnum: looking at the console logs it looks like the prepare step just doesn\'t happen. It just finishes after install.. but running npm install directly on my machine does trigger the prepare step.. maybe i should try running npm install in the vm directly.
2018-09-13T13:02:22 <Justin_o> alanharnum: i think i found the problem.. the VM is running NPM 3.10.10 but prepare was introduced in NPM 4 https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts
2018-09-13T13:02:32 <Justin_o> alanharnum: how can we update npm in the vm?

2018-09-13T13:16:49 <alanharnum> Justin_o: OK, that makes sense - let me look at what\'s needed to update the VM\'s NPM

2018-09-13T13:37:21 <alanharnum> Justin_o: is it reasonable to just roll this change to the VM config into your existing PR, or should I make a separate one?
2018-09-13T13:37:57 <Justin_o> alanharnum: if it\'s just a change that can be added to my PR, sure i can add it
2018-09-13T13:38:12 <Justin_o> i thought it might require a new box
2018-09-13T13:42:21 <alanharnum> Justin_o: no, all you should need to do is remove line 9 at https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/provisioning/vars.yml
2018-09-13T13:42:30 <alanharnum> that pins the NPM version
2018-09-13T13:42:36 * g2szeto joined the channel
2018-09-13T13:42:46 <alanharnum> with that removed, it should use the same one that comes with the node lts branch
2018-09-13T13:43:14 <alanharnum> i\'m double-checking that this is all that\'s needed on my local but that should do it
2018-09-13T13:47:45 <Justin_o> alanharnum: thanks, i made the changed. i\'m going to run my vm again to test it. If that works I\'ll push up the change to the PR.
2018-09-13T13:50:01 <alanharnum> Justin_o: ok - it appears to have worked for me, let me know how it goes for you
2018-09-13T13:50:23 <Justin_o> alanharnum: will do.. need to rebuild the vm, which takes a bit of time, but it\'s running now so hopefully not much longer
2018-09-13T13:50:30 <Justin_o> but i\'ll run the tests first as well
2018-09-13T14:07:41 * michelled joined the channel
2018-09-13T14:19:06 <gtirloni> i think that pinned version was there because we tried to keep the npm version the same in GPII and Fluid? not sure
2018-09-13T14:19:31 <gtirloni> everything i\'ve tried for fluid semed to work fine with the latest, which I think was 6.4
2018-09-13T14:20:26 <alanharnum> Justin_o: looks like the tests at issue are passing now in CI
2018-09-13T14:21:00 <Justin_o> alanharnum: great thanks :)
2018-09-13T14:21:22 <Justin_o> cindyli: could you please review this PR https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/931 You should also test out the dev release in the  PR description to make sure you can install infusion as a dependency via npm.
2018-09-13T14:21:25 <alanharnum> will wait for the whole thing to finish before saying that for sure, but seems to have been the issue, thank you for pinpointing it
2018-09-13T14:21:51 <Justin_o> alanharnum: no problem, thanks for the help tracking it down and finding the fix
2018-09-13T14:23:33 <alanharnum> gtirloni: it looks like GPII moved to just using the same NPM as node-lts back in May, but the Infusion config wasn\'t updated
2018-09-13T14:24:41 <alanharnum> actually even further back than that
2018-09-13T14:25:31 <gtirloni> ah, that\'s nice. I thought there were still some issues that required npm3
2018-09-13T14:26:15 <cindyli> ok, Justin_o
2018-09-13T14:26:17 <Justin_o> gtirloni: there was something to do with the way they have those static node_modules directories, but they worked around it. can\'t remember how now though
2018-09-13T14:26:35 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf, Bosmon, or jhernandez: would probably know
2018-09-13T14:26:46 <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks
2018-09-13T14:28:56 <the-t-in-rtf> I think early on there might have been problems, but I can\'t remember any since npm@5
2018-09-13T14:29:16 <the-t-in-rtf> (with the ./gpii/node_modules pattern we use in universal and other places)
2018-09-13T14:29:21 <gtirloni> Justin_o: interesting, just saw this https://github.com/yarnpkg/rfcs/pull/101
2018-09-13T14:30:02 <jhernandez> Justin_o: yeah, I don\'t think bumping npm should be a problem
2018-09-13T14:30:18 <jhernandez> we had different sources of problems
2018-09-13T14:31:20 <jhernandez> and in addition to npm not behaving well with git refs, I remember that we had to perform some parallel updates in our npm artifacts after fixing some issues when resolving infusion
2018-09-13T14:31:42 <jhernandez> that\'s all I can remember right now
2018-09-13T14:31:55 <jhernandez> :)
