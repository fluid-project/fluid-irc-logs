2018-08-31T14:10:25 <Justin_o> gtirloni: did you need me to look at this PR https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/pull/138 and if so, what\'s the best way for me to test it?
2018-08-31T14:11:30 * michelled joined the channel
2018-08-31T14:11:46 <gtirloni> Justin_o: alanharnum ^^ i think helps with the static site + docker-compose thing (like in the cities.* website)
2018-08-31T14:12:54 <gtirloni> Justin_o: you\'d need this: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/
2018-08-31T14:13:47 <Justin_o> gtirloni: thanks, i am using docker to my web server setup on my machine, so i guess i have compose installed already
2018-08-31T14:14:14 <alanharnum> yeah if you\'ve got the current Mac version of Docker you have compose
2018-08-31T14:15:47 <Justin_o> gtirloni and alanharnum: this pr will just make it easier to deploy

2018-08-31T14:31:23 <javjarfer[m]> hi everyone, can anyone point me how should I replace the old configuration for using the "dynamic device reporter" for testing?
2018-08-31T14:32:00 <javjarfer[m]> how should I replace the old, "development.all.local.dr.production"
2018-08-31T14:32:07 <javjarfer[m]> **?

2018-08-31T14:50:23 <javjarfer[m]> I think I got the correct config using the "gpii.config.untrusted.development.dynamicDR.all.local"
2018-08-31T14:50:27 <javjarfer[m]> but I get a weird error when trying to logout with the user
2018-08-31T14:50:39 <javjarfer[m]> message: "isRunningBlock.indexOf is not a function"
2018-08-31T14:51:23 <javjarfer[m]> with the following stack https://pastebin.com/7Sn20Gjb
2018-08-31T15:15:29 <simonjb> thanks for the merge and fixes michelled
2018-08-31T15:17:50 <michelled> thank you simonjb!
2018-08-31T15:18:14 <michelled> I\'m actually tempted to move the Floe site to Hugo
2018-08-31T15:23:31 <simonjb> michelled: I\'m still learning it but I really like Hugo so far
2018-08-31T15:25:30 <javjarfer[m]> I think I found the issue, it was related to a SR block not longer being use, thanks

2018-08-31T18:23:21 <sgithens> michelled: Is that a library, framework, or server named after one of Colin\'s catts?
2018-08-31T18:26:11 <michelled> framework :)
2018-08-31T18:26:29 <michelled> https://gohugo.io/
2018-08-31T18:27:00 <michelled> it\'s nice that the url is so supportive of that lovely cat :)
2018-08-31T18:35:05 <gtirloni> next we should adopt this :) https://esolangs.org/wiki/Chicken
2018-08-31T18:42:31 <sgithens> michelled Cool.  Is it more fun to use than like jekyll or docpad?  I think docpad actually isn\'t maintained anymore... I wonder if it would parse all the fluid md files
2018-08-31T18:43:09 <michelled> I\'m not sure about md files, but it seems that it\'s easier to work with than jekyll and docpad. I haven\'t used any of them extensively
2018-08-31T18:43:30 <michelled> jhung and simonjb also seem to like Hugo \t
2018-08-31T18:43:58 <sgithens> michelled do you mostly write markdown for it though?  Or something else to populate the content?
2018-08-31T18:45:09 <jhung> sgithens: I really like Hugo and I\'ve spent a lot of time with Docpad. I find getting sites up and running and maintaining Hugo sites much easier.
2018-08-31T18:48:26 <michelled> sgithens: it\'s not markdown - it\'s html with some code in it
2018-08-31T18:48:37 <sgithens> oh it looks like docpad got some new maintainers
2018-08-31T18:48:56 <sgithens> hmm
2018-08-31T18:51:23 <michelled> ha, I said that and then realized that the very thing I tweaked today *was* a markdown file

2018-08-31T20:19:04 <alanharnum> Anecdotally, I converted my personal site over from Jekyll to Hugo with minimal need to change my md files
2018-08-31T20:19:44 <alanharnum> I find Hugo quite easy to work with provided its (relatively) narrow feature set covers your use cases for static site generation.
2018-08-31T20:20:40 <alanharnum> and it\'s incredibly fast at handling large sites compared to any other static generator I\'ve used, which is useful when using it as a writing tool - MD -> HTML rerendering is near-instant
