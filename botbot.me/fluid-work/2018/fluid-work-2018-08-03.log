2018-08-03T15:44:19 <clown> fluid-everyone:  (yet another distraction)  the past two days, when I connect to freenode\'s IRC, I get a "Received CTCP \'VERSION\' (to clown) from frigg" message.  Has this happened to anyone else?
2018-08-03T15:44:24 <clown> AFAIT, something, or someone, is checking my client.
2018-08-03T15:44:43 <jhung_meeting> clown I get that as well.
2018-08-03T15:45:09 <clown> jhung, thanks.  I guesss the system or the admins are checking clients.
2018-08-03T15:47:21 <mrtyler> clown: i\'ve seen it as well starting a few days ago. you have correctly deduced what \'ctcp version\' means :)
2018-08-03T15:47:55 <mrtyler> another clue is that frigg is "frigg@freenode/utility-bot/frigg"
2018-08-03T15:48:43 <clown> mrtyler, not deduced, but searched for that gist of that message and found a doc that described it.  I didn\'t determine that it was a bot \xe2\x80\x94 thanks for that.
2018-08-03T15:49:31 <mrtyler> aren\'t "deduction" and "google search" basically equivalent in our modern world? ;)
2018-08-03T15:51:41 <clown> can be, mrtyler.  you make an interesting point.

2018-08-03T17:09:17 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i\'m running into another issue with the youtube captions. I\'m injecting a build of Infusion into the page so that i can use it in the enactor. However, that seems to be conflicting with an existing instance of infusion on the page. I\'m testing things out in the captionsPreference example from infusion. The extension can set the captions, but the prefs editor on the page is broken and throws errors
2018-08-03T17:09:56 <Bosmon> Hi Justin_o
2018-08-03T17:10:08 <Bosmon> You\'ll need to provide quite a lot more detail on the issue
2018-08-03T17:10:16 <Bosmon> Since it\'s impossible to guess what it is from your description
2018-08-03T17:11:14 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay.. i\'ll try
2018-08-03T17:11:45 <Justin_o> Bosmon: if you recall for YouTube Captions preferences in UIO+ we have a problem because of script injection for the YouTube iframe API.
2018-08-03T17:12:34 <Justin_o> One solution was to shift more of the work to scripts injected into the webpage, so that they run in the same JavaScript environment. This used window.message to communicate between the content scripts and the web page to pass the model value.
2018-08-03T17:12:43 <Bosmon> Yes
2018-08-03T17:12:55 <Bosmon> When you say "an existing instance of Infusion on the page"
2018-08-03T17:13:00 <Justin_o> So that\'s working, however, I need to inject a build of Infusion into the webpage so that we can use infusion in the enactor.
2018-08-03T17:13:06 <Bosmon> It sounds like you might know what this instance is and how it got there?
2018-08-03T17:13:30 <Justin_o> however, if the web page already has a copy of infusion there is a conflict.. i\'m experiencing this on our captionsPreferences example in infusion
2018-08-03T17:13:52 <Justin_o> https://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/examples/framework/preferences/captionsPreference/
2018-08-03T17:13:56 <Bosmon> ok
2018-08-03T17:14:06 <Bosmon> And is it that this version of Infusion is incompatible, or simply because it is included twice?
2018-08-03T17:14:40 <Justin_o> It should be compatible, in that they are actually the same version of infusion
2018-08-03T17:14:47 <Justin_o> so it\'s probably that they are included twice
2018-08-03T17:14:49 <Bosmon> ok
2018-08-03T17:15:12 <Justin_o> but i guess i can try to remove pieces of infusion from the page and see if it works, i haven\'t done that yet
2018-08-03T17:15:24 <Bosmon> I guess we will need a kind of "deduping", similarly to what we do in the node.js environment....
2018-08-03T17:15:39 <Bosmon> We\'re still a long way from being able to spend the kind of time we need on the modularity of Infusion
2018-08-03T17:15:51 <Justin_o> It might be tricky because there may be different parts of infusion that are required in both parts
2018-08-03T17:15:58 <Justin_o> from both instances
2018-08-03T17:16:14 <Bosmon> Justin_o - the only harmful bit will stem from the multiple inclusion of Fluid.js and FluidIoC.js
2018-08-03T17:16:41 <Bosmon> Not that in theory this makes the issue hugely easier, but it at least means you don\'t need to deal with the modularity of the entire framework image
2018-08-03T17:17:16 <Bosmon> We used to have the idiom and the capability for multiple Infusions to coexist, which on paper they still can, but not in a way which is currently useful to us
2018-08-03T17:17:24 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i suppose we could also run into conflicts of the versions of infusion too, in the wild. Because even though we bind to a versioned fluid instance (i.e. fluid_3_0_), all of the various dev releases point at that.
2018-08-03T17:17:40 <Bosmon> Firstly, they would need to be Infusions which were genuinely different versions, and secondly they would need to bind to a differently named global
2018-08-03T17:17:47 <Bosmon> Neither of which is true in this case
2018-08-03T17:18:10 <Bosmon> But thirdly there is the issue that this wouldn\'t stop Infusion from trying to create a fresh global instantiator on top of the old one
2018-08-03T17:18:20 <Justin_o> yes.. they are both pointing at the same versioned global
2018-08-03T17:18:49 <Bosmon> As well as a fresh copy of the defaults registry
2018-08-03T17:19:50 <Bosmon> Justin_o - are both of the instances of Infusion using a build?
2018-08-03T17:20:34 <Justin_o> Bosmon: let me try an instance in the wild and see if that is also broken. In the case I\'ve tried, the example doesn\'t use a build, only the injected code did
2018-08-03T17:20:52 <Bosmon> Justin_o - no, I\'m sure it will be
2018-08-03T17:21:09 <Justin_o> also the extension makes it\'s own custom builds. We may want to move away from that later, but it\'s how things work at the moment.
2018-08-03T17:21:10 <Bosmon> I was just asking since I was thinking that the easiest place to tackle this without creating a huge diff would be in the build process
2018-08-03T17:22:01 <Bosmon> Perhaps the only real way out of this is to provide a "coreless build" of Infusion for use on sites that already have an Infusion
2018-08-03T17:22:39 <Bosmon> Any other kind of solution I can think of is wild and awful and involves lots of refactoring we will not have time for for a long while
2018-08-03T17:22:42 <Justin_o> It would be problematic to infer that though
2018-08-03T17:23:12 <Justin_o> whether a site was running infusion or not.. the scripts also get injected into the iframes automatically too
2018-08-03T17:23:46 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i suppose another solution would be to use vanilla javascript for all of the injected code.
2018-08-03T17:24:00 <Bosmon> Justin_o - OK well... we could think then about some kind of very crude multiple inclusion guard to go into those two files
2018-08-03T17:24:12 <Bosmon> That checks the particular global that it tries to bind to for already having an Infusion
2018-08-03T17:25:55 <Justin_o> Bosmon: but it would have to be the latest version of infusion that includes the captionsEnactor
2018-08-03T17:26:13 <Justin_o> an infusion that is already on another site in the wild likely wouldn\'t have this
2018-08-03T17:26:53 <Bosmon> Justin_o - the include resistance would only go onto those two core files
2018-08-03T17:27:09 <Bosmon> Including any other code should be harmless
2018-08-03T17:27:17 * michelled has quit
2018-08-03T17:27:22 <Bosmon> It\'s a fudge, but it will get us out of the immediate difficulty for a while
2018-08-03T17:27:41 <Justin_o> Bosmon: and would that be backwards compatible with existing versions of infusion?
2018-08-03T17:28:11 <Bosmon> Justin_o - well this obviously isn\'t going to get us arbitrary backwards compatibility
2018-08-03T17:28:33 <Bosmon> But a) we never promised that in the first place, b) we can\'t promise any such thing until we start issuing official builds on a regular basis
2018-08-03T17:28:37 <Justin_o> I mean, would the extension break this site https://humanrights.ca/
2018-08-03T17:30:01 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I can\'t tell, because I can\'t easily tell what version of Infusion that site is running
2018-08-03T17:30:19 <Bosmon> Actually it looks like a very old one
2018-08-03T17:30:23 <Justin_o> Bosmon: another potential issue is that the duplicate includes of jQuery might be breaking things too.. i did add jQuery.noConflict() to my file though.. so hopefully it will be okay. But it\'s hard to tell with the way things get injected what the outcome really will be, in terms of order or interpretation and etc.
2018-08-03T17:30:30 <Bosmon> One in fact so old that it does indeed use a differently named version of the global
2018-08-03T17:31:47 <Bosmon> Very very old
2018-08-03T17:31:54 <Justin_o> Bosmon: this might be a better example then https://openconcept.ca/
2018-08-03T17:31:59 <Bosmon> Its global is named fluid_3_0
2018-08-03T17:32:02 <Bosmon> sorry
2018-08-03T17:32:05 <Bosmon> fluid_2_0
2018-08-03T17:32:34 <Bosmon> Perhaps writing the captions enactor in vanilla JavaScript might be the way to go
2018-08-03T17:32:38 <Justin_o> The drupal plugin uses a dev release of FLUID v3.0.0 so that would have the same namespace issue
2018-08-03T17:32:52 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay.. i\'ll work on that.. i think it would be the simplest for now anyways...
2018-08-03T17:32:59 <Justin_o> but i don\'t think i\'ll have it done today
2018-08-03T17:33:14 <Bosmon> We certainly did that for the-t-in-rtf \'s injected testem scripts which needed to work in an arbitrary environment
2018-08-03T17:33:32 <Justin_o> ah, so there is some precedence.. although that\'s not quite the same case
2018-08-03T17:35:24 <Bosmon> Not quite, since in his case he made the assumption that his scripts could always refer to Infusion even if he hadn\'t loaded it
2018-08-03T17:36:36 <Justin_o> yes, i won\'t have that ability

2018-08-03T08:54:30 <georgitodorov> stegru: Hey, Steve! I have been integrating the "App / Text Zoom" functionality
2018-08-03T08:55:26 <georgitodorov> It works awesome, in most cases. I found out that zoom is not applied to Chrome, IE and Edge if the DPI is 125%
2018-08-03T08:55:55 <georgitodorov> If the DPI is set to a different value (100% or 150%), zoom is applied to these applications
2018-08-03T08:56:14 <georgitodorov> Do you have a clue as to what might be happening?
2018-08-03T08:57:14 <georgitodorov> Also, I discovered an edge case - if the app is launched, there has been no window which was activated and the user tries to use the "App / Text Zoom" functionality, the PSP crashes
2018-08-03T08:57:33 <georgitodorov> It is due to the config object being undefined here: https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/188/files#diff-477b2892acf6e85baf66cc34a9056e0dR170

2018-08-03T11:27:04 <stegru> also, I\'ve noticed a problem where there\'s another window (like the PSP) on top of chrome, at the centre, it doesn\'t work
2018-08-03T11:33:21 <georgitodorov> stegru: The resolution is 1920x1080

2018-08-03T12:34:08 <cindyli> georgitodorov: regarding "noUser" is not keyed back in after being keyed out. does this happen when you explicitly key out "noUser"?
2018-08-03T12:34:24 <cindyli> when do you need to explicitly key out "noUser"?
2018-08-03T12:37:22 <georgitodorov> cindyli: Yes, exactly - the "noUser" is not automatically keyed in after being keyed out
2018-08-03T12:37:54 <georgitodorov> The last item in the context menu for the tray icon will be "Reset Morphic"
2018-08-03T12:38:32 <georgitodorov> This is something that we discussed on our status call on Monday and it was decided that "Reset Morphic" will simply be a key-out operation
2018-08-03T12:39:22 <cindyli> why wasn\'t the decision to use the "reset" key?
2018-08-03T12:39:31 <georgitodorov> And Bosmon suggested that the expected workflow when the noUser was keyed out would be that it would be keyed in again
2018-08-03T12:40:06 <georgitodorov> cindyli: Reset key? What exactly do you mean?
2018-08-03T12:40:06 <Bosmon> cindyli - I did think it was a bit puzzling that last night you were talking about "reset"
2018-08-03T12:40:10 <cindyli> georgitodorov: at the moment, i have a condition in the code to prevent the keyin of "noUser" when it was just keyed out
2018-08-03T12:40:19 <Bosmon> But when I traced back your code it did seem that you were just trying to deal with the normal logout process
2018-08-03T12:40:27 <Bosmon> But I must have made a mistake
2018-08-03T12:41:10 <cindyli> Bosmon: why "Reset Morphic" doesn\'t use /user/reset/login?
2018-08-03T12:41:15 <cindyli> or /user/reset/logout?
2018-08-03T12:43:25 <Bosmon> cindyli - because it wasn\'t clear that this would be the effect
2018-08-03T12:43:52 <Bosmon> I don\'t think we have proper documentation on what the "reset" key actually does
2018-08-03T12:44:02 <Bosmon> Or even that it actually exists...
2018-08-03T12:44:17 <cindyli> "reset" automatically triggers the logout of the current user
2018-08-03T12:44:50 <Bosmon> This special key seems unnecessary now that we have the QSS
2018-08-03T12:45:14 <Bosmon> I guess it made sense when we had to work with RFID tokens
2018-08-03T12:46:01 <Bosmon> Also I think the behaviour when someone is keyed in for "reset Morphic" would not be to key them out
2018-08-03T12:46:08 <Bosmon> So we may have different semantics in any case
2018-08-03T12:46:55 <Bosmon> georgitodorov - what is the expectation for "Reset Morphic" when someone is keyed in (which is the case we are most interested in for the first demo)?
2018-08-03T12:48:35 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: As per QSS v1 specification: If someone is keyed-in,
2018-08-03T12:48:36 <georgitodorov> this will key-out the current user
2018-08-03T12:48:36 <georgitodorov> which also resets all the QSS settings
2018-08-03T12:48:45 <Bosmon> ok
2018-08-03T12:48:56 <Bosmon> So it sounds like the current implementation of the "reset" key is appropriate then
2018-08-03T12:49:16 <Bosmon> The quickest thing would be for you to reimplement "reset Morphic" as an attempted login of the "reset" key
2018-08-03T12:49:58 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: So, there will be no key out right now. Instead, it will be a key in of the "reset" key?
2018-08-03T12:50:34 <Bosmon> georgitodorov - I believe this is how cindyli says it should work, yes
2018-08-03T12:50:46 <Bosmon> But we should make time to write up docs for this after this demo cycle
2018-08-03T12:50:53 <georgitodorov> Bosmon: Okay, thanks. Will give this a try right now
2018-08-03T12:55:16 <cindyli> Bosmon: regarding the problem with task 4 that georgitodorov mentioned in his email reply, it\'s because when the "dictionary" is turned off, PSP channel receives {supportingTool: []}, which is to remove "dictionary" from the array. and it\'s why when the same key is keyed back in, the dictionary selection is gone because we don\'t have a flag to keep tack of the case that "dictionary" has been turned off. when it\'s turned off, this ite
2018-08-03T12:55:17 <cindyli> m is simply removed from the supportingTool array
2018-08-03T12:55:36 <cindyli> how can we fix it
2018-08-03T12:55:46 <Bosmon> The PSP channel should actually receive a DELETE
2018-08-03T12:56:01 <Bosmon> There are some utilities written by simonjb which will help in such a case
2018-08-03T12:56:35 <cindyli> well, this is when the same key is keyed back in, which is a different session
2018-08-03T12:57:06 <cindyli> the re-keyin fetches saved prefs from the cloud again
2018-08-03T12:57:12 <Bosmon> cindyli - actually Justin_o has an active pull to remove the dictionary in any case

2018-08-03T12:57:24 <Bosmon> But I\'m not sure I understand the problem here
2018-08-03T12:57:25 <cindyli> Bosmon: whoa. saved me

2018-08-03T12:58:28 <cindyli> snapset_1a keys in, it has dictionary turned on. its corresponding preference saved in the cloud looks like - {supportingTool: ["dictionary"]}
2018-08-03T12:59:20 <cindyli> PSP shows a dictionary with a checkbox on
2018-08-03T12:59:38 <cindyli> the user uses PSP to turn off the dictionary checkbox
2018-08-03T13:00:13 <cindyli> and click the save button

2018-08-03T13:00:29 <cindyli> the prefs change received at LFM is {supportingTool: []}. this will be saved to the cloud
2018-08-03T13:00:41 <cindyli> snapset_1a keys out and keys back in
2018-08-03T13:00:47 * georgitodorov joined the channel
2018-08-03T13:01:01 <cindyli> PSP requested prefs from cloud and received {supportingTool: []}

2018-08-03T13:01:21 <cindyli> PSP thinks no supporting tool item should be displayed
2018-08-03T13:01:53 <cindyli> i think the proper fix for this might be, instead of using an array for supportingTool, use object
2018-08-03T13:01:56 <Bosmon> cindyli - Well I think it sounds like this preference has been ontologised incorrectly
2018-08-03T13:02:12 <cindyli> {
2018-08-03T13:02:12 <cindyli> supportingTool: {
2018-08-03T13:02:12 <cindyli> dictionary: false
2018-08-03T13:02:12 <cindyli> }
2018-08-03T13:02:12 <cindyli> }
2018-08-03T13:02:22 <Bosmon> The whole point of having model transformations is to prevent the editing tools from having to deal with arrays of that kind
2018-08-03T13:02:40 <Bosmon> But given we are deleting it, the problem is going away : P
2018-08-03T13:03:04 <cindyli> yes, safe for now
2018-08-03T13:03:20 <cindyli> needs a solution for the next step
2018-08-03T13:03:23 <Justin_o> for UIO+ when we used Dictionary the solutions registry transformed that array into a boolean for Dictionary

2018-08-03T13:04:20 <cindyli> Justin_o: do you know if boolean is tranformed back to an array when it\'s sent to the flow manager?

2018-08-03T13:04:58 <Justin_o> cindyli: UIO+ didn\'t save back, but I would imagine the transformation was invertible
2018-08-03T13:05:04 <Bosmon> cindyli - this will be set up in the solutions registry entry for the item in question
2018-08-03T13:05:05 <cindyli> ok
