2018-09-20T19:00:27 <Bosmon> This last fix was a classic "this can never have worked"
2018-09-20T19:00:32 <Bosmon> I\'m genuinely bamboozled
2018-09-20T19:00:34 <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/core/js/DataBinding.js#L448
2018-09-20T19:00:49 <Bosmon> In general, folks, be aware that Math.Infinity is not anything!
2018-09-20T19:00:52 <Bosmon> In fact, it is undefined
2018-09-20T19:01:19 <jhung> alanharnum: I have merged the PR with changes to the infusion-docs deploy. You might have to change things on your end to use it. see https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/pull/134
2018-09-20T19:01:35 <alanharnum> jhung: thanks, I\'ll update the CI branch

2018-09-20T19:02:03 <Justin_o> Bosmon: another one of those JS quirks?
2018-09-20T19:02:15 <Bosmon> Well, I can\'t understand how this could ever have worked
2018-09-20T19:02:30 <Justin_o> Bosmon: Is there a truthy check on recel.initPriority somewhere else?
2018-09-20T19:02:44 <Bosmon> No, the very next thing sends it to a sort
2018-09-20T19:02:59 <Bosmon> And so the positioning of this element will be essentially undetermined since every comparison will return NaN
2018-09-20T19:03:27 <Bosmon> It\'s conceivable that we always depended on some random quirk of the ordering which miraculously always ended up the way we wanted
2018-09-20T19:05:10 <Justin_o> Did you mean to use just Infinity instead of Math.Infinity
2018-09-20T19:05:17 <gmoss> Justin_o: sorry I was in discussions for a bit there. I\'m glad you were able to reproduce the issue! I\'m stuck for the time being... trying to think of a way to get the templateLoader to work without firing onLazyLoad again. The firing of that event after calling reloadUioMessages was what produced the duplicate call to loadResources, I think
2018-09-20T19:05:30 <Justin_o> was that condition ever hit? or maybe it was only hit when it would have ended up in the position it did?
2018-09-20T19:06:28 <stegru> 1 > Infinity == 1 > undefined
2018-09-20T19:06:33 <stegru> does the same job ;)
2018-09-20T19:07:14 <Justin_o> so you\'re both telling me that when Buzz Lightyear goes to Infinity and Beyond, he\'s not really going anywhere
2018-09-20T19:07:45 <stegru> no, it\'s just failing with style

2018-09-20T22:21:44 <cindyli> Bosmon: there\'s a problem with flat matchmaker. it does pick all exact matched solutions, which results in a similar problem as the fix of "depth >= canopy[j]". when there are multiple matched solutions, it will set all of them to be "active" in matchMakerOutput.inferredConfiguration. this will make windows to start all these solutions again
2018-09-20T22:22:14 <cindyli> for example, in win32.json, there are multiple matched solutions for "http://registry\\\\.gpii\\\\.net/common/screenReaderTTS/enabled"
2018-09-20T22:22:30 <Bosmon> cindyli - yes
2018-09-20T22:22:36 <Bosmon> I imagine we need flat matchmaker + apptology
2018-09-20T22:22:47 <cindyli> i see
2018-09-20T22:45:22 <cindyli> Bosmon: when there are multiple solutions having the same type, such as "screen reader", canopy match maker selects the one that has the top priority. with flat match maker, there\'s no priority calculation. shall the first matched solution be picked?
2018-09-20T22:45:50 <Bosmon> cindyli - Yes, we can ignore priorities for the time being
2018-09-20T22:45:59 <Bosmon> They won\'t be deployed for the near-term pilots
2018-09-20T22:46:06 <cindyli> ok

b'2018-09-20T15:56:37 <Bosmon> I\'m trying to fight my way through "fluid.prefs.expandCompositePanels" .........
2018-09-20T15:56:59 <Justin_o> Bosmon: hello.. taking a look and trying to remember
2018-09-20T15:57:21 <Bosmon> Justin_o - cheers
2018-09-20T15:57:48 <Justin_o> Bosmon: can you point me at the tests you are looking at?
2018-09-20T15:58:47 <Bosmon> Yup, it\'s this rendering test: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/tests/framework-tests/preferences/js/BuilderTests.js#L694
2018-09-20T15:59:19 <Bosmon> I\'ve got the issue that the composite panel, called "increasing", has a subComponent of type "fluid.tests.cmpPanel.lineSpace"
2018-09-20T15:59:30 <Justin_o> Bosmon: I think it\'s related to this https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/preferences/js/Panels.js#L405-L407
2018-09-20T15:59:33 <Bosmon> All this tree is trying to construct at once, and the nested panel is looking for its container in the DOM
2018-09-20T16:00:43 <Bosmon> Which should have a selector ".fluid-tests-composite-increasing-lineSpace"
2018-09-20T16:01:36 <Bosmon> But the issue is that the composite panel hasn\'t fired onCreate yet and so hasn\'t appended its markup via this listener: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/preferences/js/Panels.js#L229
2018-09-20T16:01:47 <Justin_o> Bosmon: which is then added via distribute options https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/preferences/js/Panels.js#L430-L433
2018-09-20T16:02:00 <Justin_o> so that createOnEvent is added programmatically.
2018-09-20T16:02:03 <Bosmon> Also I\'m rather worried that these listeners don\'t seem to be sequenced in any way
2018-09-20T16:02:03 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2018-09-20T16:02:06 <Bosmon> Aha!
2018-09-20T16:02:46 <Justin_o> Bosmon: this is all pretty old, i\'m often amazed that it even works ;) It could definitely use some cleanup
2018-09-20T16:02:55 <Bosmon> Justin_o - great, this is just what I wanted
2018-09-20T16:03:14 <Bosmon> And explains perfectly why it has stopped working
2018-09-20T16:03:27 <Bosmon> Since we can\'t distributed to nested component paths like that any more
2018-09-20T16:03:28 <Justin_o> i hope the fix is easy :)
2018-09-20T16:03:33 <Justin_o> ah
2018-09-20T16:03:41 <Bosmon> That is, you can\'t distribute to "{that}.options.components.*"
2018-09-20T16:03:52 <Justin_o> i\'m guessing you need to use IoCSS now?
2018-09-20T16:04:07 <Bosmon> Well, you could say that you were already using IoCSS
2018-09-20T16:04:16 <Bosmon> But yes, you need to hit the component directly with IoCSS
2018-09-20T16:05:14 <Bosmon> You can\'t hit the one above and expect to navigate down via options.components.* - in order to fix FLUID-5614 we\'ve had to break up the linkage between the exact contents of options.component.x (which is now an array) and the form that you write it in "deep component trees"
2018-09-20T16:10:35 <Justin_o> Bosmon: does that mean that you can\'t do that.subcomponent.method() in side of a function anymore or is this just an IoC change?
2018-09-20T16:12:38 <Bosmon> Justin_o oh oh oh I see
2018-09-20T16:12:41 <Bosmon> There is more happening here
2018-09-20T16:12:47 <Bosmon> This thing is actually introspecting on its own component options
2018-09-20T16:12:55 <Bosmon> Which has, independently, also stopped working for the same reason
2018-09-20T16:16:46 <cindyli> Bosmon: i found the cause of https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3388, we should talk about how to solve it. the issue was rooted from this change - https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/659/files#diff-a095eea627fbc50a2d57ca0e493f3b42R113. The matchmaker output for the failing windows test used to return two matched solutions: "windows.cursors" and "windows.magnifier". now it returns 14 solutions including stickyKeys, narrator, wind
2018-09-20T16:16:47 <cindyli> ows.highContrast, screenDPI etc. windows tries to apply them all and results in failures.
2018-09-20T16:41:37 <cindyli> i\'m thinking if this could be solved by having a way to define grouped solutions. for example, if "windows.highContrast" and UIO+ are defined as group solutions, when one is picked by the matchmaker as the best fit, the other should be included in the matchmaker output too. with this, matchmaker continues to pick one best fit, rather than many. one extra step can be added after the pick to include grouped solutions. what do you think
2018-09-20T16:41:37 <cindyli> , Bosmon
2018-09-20T16:43:58 <Bosmon> cindyli - well all the other 14 solutions are presumably really terrible matches and should be discarded
2018-09-20T16:44:03 <Bosmon> Why does it think they match at all?
2018-09-20T16:46:12 <stegru> \'\'\'\'\'\'\'\'\'\'\'\'\'\'\'##
2018-09-20T16:48:08 <cindyli> Bosmon: canopy matchmaker performs a ranking calculation before checking depths. for each solution, the raking generates an fitness array like [-2, -2, -3\xe2\x80\xa6]
2018-09-20T16:48:44 <cindyli> some of 14 solutions are for matching "magnification". they all have the same ranking (fitness array value)
2018-09-20T16:49:14 <cindyli> the others for matching "cursorSize" and have the same ranking too
2018-09-20T16:50:18 <cindyli> those 14 probably are not terrible, but it doesn\'t make sense to start a number of solutions for satisfying a magnifier preference
2018-09-20T16:50:27 <cindyli> or any preference
2018-09-20T16:52:41 <Bosmon> cindyli - OK, so you are suggesting to stick them into the apptology?
2018-09-20T16:52:49 <Bosmon> Why does stickyKeys match anything?
2018-09-20T16:57:51 <cindyli> stickyKeys has the same fitness array value after the ranking calculation. but the prefs set didn\'t ask for "http://registry.gpii.net/common/stickyKeys". maybe the ranking doesn\'t look at the prefs? weird

2018-09-20T16:58:21 <Bosmon> cindyli - it might well be time to just axe the whole canopyMatchmaker
2018-09-20T16:58:35 <Bosmon> We have only promised essentially "exact match" matchmaking for the upcoming releases anyway
2018-09-20T17:01:27 <cindyli> Bosmon: if you look at win32.json, some common terms are associated with multiple solutions
2018-09-20T17:01:54 <cindyli> for example, http://registry\\\\.gpii\\\\.net/common/selfVoicing/enabled matches "net.gpii.uioPlus" and "net.opendirective.maavis"
2018-09-20T17:02:08 <Bosmon> cindyli - that\'s understandable
2018-09-20T17:02:12 <Bosmon> But what about stickyKeys?
2018-09-20T17:02:23 <Bosmon> It only matches its own common term
2018-09-20T17:04:48 <cindyli> exactly, that\'s what makes me think canopy match maker does not filter prefs before ranking calculation
2018-09-20T17:04:59 <Bosmon> cindyli - well, of course it doesnt\'
2018-09-20T17:05:24 <cindyli> oh why
2018-09-20T17:05:30 <Bosmon> But the point is, the ranking calculation must be busted if it can possibly consider stickyKeys
2018-09-20T17:05:32 <cindyli> isn\'t matching prefs the first thing to do
2018-09-20T17:05:43 <cindyli> agree
2018-09-20T17:05:44 <Bosmon> cindyli - this *is* the process of matching prefs
2018-09-20T17:06:26 <Bosmon> This ranking that it is doing now, this is the filtering process
2018-09-20T17:06:39 <cindyli> ok
2018-09-20T17:09:00 <cindyli> Bosmon: ideas on how to solve this? create a exactMatchMaker module? ;)
2018-09-20T17:11:05 <Justin_o> stegru: could you please test out https://github.com/jobara/gpii-chrome-extension/tree/GPII-3386 and see if it fixes the issue
2018-09-20T17:13:03 <Bosmon> cindyli - there always was one
2018-09-20T17:13:12 <cindyli> flatMatchMaker
2018-09-20T17:13:17 <Bosmon> cindyli - exactly
2018-09-20T17:13:51 <cindyli> trying how it looks like...
2018-09-20T17:14:18 <Bosmon> cindyli - it might need a touch of dusting off, but I think with just minor tweaking it will do what we want
2018-09-20T17:14:30 <Bosmon> Perhaps it has the fault that currently it only returns a single solution, I can\'t quite remember
2018-09-20T17:14:42 <Bosmon> But it is certainly much closer to being what we want than the canopyMatchMaker
2018-09-20T17:14:59 <Bosmon> And part of your pull can then delete the canopyMatchMaker and its tests
2018-09-20T17:15:03 <Bosmon> Very sad, but I think it is time
2018-09-20T17:15:26 <Bosmon> I remember the bus ride to Denver Airport where I thought of that, in 2012 : P
2018-09-20T17:15:30 <Bosmon> It was a happy, sunny afternoon
2018-09-20T17:18:27 <cindyli> delete the canopyMatchMaker???!!! are you sure
2018-09-20T17:19:13 <cindyli> crying...
2018-09-20T17:19:21 <Bosmon> cindyli - absolutely, it does nothing useful that we will depend on for this grant
2018-09-20T17:19:39 <Bosmon> I cried when your OAuth stuff was deleted too : P
2018-09-20T17:23:08 <Bosmon> OK, new framework is very close..... 35 failing tests out of 7393
2018-09-20T17:23:43 <Bosmon> I\'m sure most of them have the same cause as well
2018-09-20T17:23:49 <cindyli> cool
2018-09-20T17:24:11 <Bosmon> Some more funky introspection on options.components.* ......
2018-09-20T17:24:48 <Justin_o> Bosmon:  is that in prefsFramework too?
2018-09-20T17:25:02 <Justin_o> Bosmon: also is this new framework building ontop of Potenia II?
2018-09-20T17:25:06 <Bosmon> Justin_o - all the remaining test failures are somewhere in the prefs framework yes
2018-09-20T17:25:13 <Justin_o> Bosmon: sorry :(
2018-09-20T17:25:35 <Bosmon> Justin_o - well, one can\'t anticipate everything : P
2018-09-20T17:25:56 <Bosmon> The existing Potentia II branch supported the prefs framework ok, but I broke a lot more things fixing FLUID-5614
2018-09-20T17:26:35 <Justin_o> Bosmon: how close is the new framework and will it make testing things that are asynchronous easier. I\'m wondering if it might address the issues that gmoss is running into with writing some tests for the prefs framework. where we\'re updating the rendering after changing the language.
2018-09-20T17:26:45 <Bosmon> Which in the scheme of things was a bug people didn\'t encounter very often but I thought it was time to deal with it properly
2018-09-20T17:27:08 <Bosmon> Justin_o - it will help, but only after we have written the new renderer and eliminated the prefs framework : P
2018-09-20T17:27:14 <Justin_o> lol
2018-09-20T17:27:18 <Bosmon> There\'s still a lot of thickets to fight through
2018-09-20T17:27:27 <Justin_o> okay so not any  time soon.. really looking forward to those two realities though
2018-09-20T17:27:30 <gmoss> Justin_o: I was wondering when I would be mentioned in this discussion haha..
2018-09-20T17:27:30 <gmoss> Bosmon do you think you could have that ready for tomorrow? :P
2018-09-20T17:27:39 <Bosmon> hahaha
2018-09-20T17:28:02 <Bosmon> not really
2018-09-20T17:28:08 <Justin_o> gmoss: sometimes Bosmon works miracles, so you never know.
2018-09-20T17:28:10 <Bosmon> But hopefully I can finally start on it on Monday
2018-09-20T17:28:15 <Bosmon> This has only taken 10 years to get to this point
2018-09-20T17:29:24 <gmoss> I will patiently await the day
2018-09-20T17:31:05 <Bosmon> I guess it\'s great that we have the prefs framework, given it represents a good kind of benchmark
2018-09-20T17:31:14 <Bosmon> The aim of the new renderer will be to make it go away completely
2018-09-20T17:32:19 <Justin_o> gmoss: i have some time to take a look at the UIO test problem we were working on yesterday. However, they\'re fixing something at my apartment right now and its very loud because of the construction outside too. Do you have your work pushed up and I can try to look at it here, and then pair up when things quiet down on my end.
2018-09-20T17:33:00 <gmoss> Justin_o: let me see if what I have up currently is sufficient. I think the answer is yes
2018-09-20T17:33:01 <Justin_o> Bosmon: that\'s great.. i hope it\'s sufficiently complex to exercise the new renderer.
2018-09-20T17:33:24 <Bosmon> Justin_o - well it\'s really more complex than I would like, but at least it is real :)
2018-09-20T17:34:36 <gmoss> Justin_o: https://github.com/blueslug/infusion/tree/FLUID-6300 is up to date less the logging we added yesterday and a couple light bits of refactoring I did yesterday evening which I may undo
2018-09-20T17:34:58 <Justin_o> haha. well we don\'t find much use for some of the complexities anymore.. but they may come back. I think the only cases of composite panels and sub panels right now are in the examples directory. But we may see more as we expand on UIO+ and other prefs editors.
2018-09-20T17:35:04 <Justin_o> Bosmon: ^
2018-09-20T17:35:23 <Justin_o> gmoss: thanks, i\'ll pull that down
2018-09-20T17:38:14 <Justin_o> gmoss: by the way, if you haven\'t already, you should update from master. I merged in the-t-in-rtf linting changes. The linting is quite fast now.

2018-09-20T17:38:43 <gmoss> Justin_o: I did this morning, but i\'ll pull again. Thanks!
2018-09-20T17:39:01 <gmoss> looks like i got it already
2018-09-20T17:39:16 <Justin_o> I think i merged it pretty early this morning
2018-09-20T17:41:30 <Justin_o> gmoss: which tests were failing again, was it the UI Options tests or one of the prefs framework ones?
2018-09-20T17:41:39 * jhung joined the channel
2018-09-20T17:41:41 <gmoss> UI Options tests, test #3

2018-09-20T17:42:04 <Justin_o> all passing on FF for me. I\'ll see if i can find a way to throttle the CPU
2018-09-20T17:42:11 <gmoss> cpukiller is what I used
2018-09-20T17:42:25 <Justin_o> gmoss: also, have you run it through the linux vm with vagrant
2018-09-20T17:42:39 <gmoss> I have not, just running tests on my browsers locally
2018-09-20T17:42:56 <gmoss> Justin_o ^^

2018-09-20T18:08:38 <stegru> ok thanks Justin_o, I\'ll have a look at it
2018-09-20T18:08:48 <Justin_o> stegru: thanks
2018-09-20T18:19:51 <stegru> Justin_o: try this... zoom a tab, then open a new one - it causes it to fight between 100% and whatever the UIO+ setting is
2018-09-20T18:20:22 <stegru> I got that, too - that\'s why I gave up ;)
2018-09-20T18:21:06 <stegru> the new tabs always sends onZoomChange, with both new and old == 1
2018-09-20T18:26:06 <Justin_o> stegru: on macOS i don\'t get a fight, but it does always reset to 100% :(
2018-09-20T18:26:41 <stegru> oh, then I wonder if windows is different..
2018-09-20T18:27:16 <Justin_o> i think it might be a bit different. i think i had issues like that just for setting it at all before.. but either way it\'s a problem to always reset when a new tab or window re-open :(
2018-09-20T18:27:47 <stegru> same on windows
2018-09-20T18:29:19 <stegru> I get the feeling it\'s going to be one of those fixes that are a pain to solve - unless it will give you sleepless nights, defer it until another time
2018-09-20T18:29:40 <stegru> I\'ll just get jhernandez to look at the work-around for the pilot
2018-09-20T18:31:31 <jhernandez> stegru: which one?
2018-09-20T18:31:46 <Justin_o> stegru: okay, let me know. In terms of the PR you sent me earlier, the thing i\'m worried about there is that if the user\'s preference is 1, it will not reset any zoomed instances.
2018-09-20T18:32:37 <stegru> yes you\'re right, Justin_o
2018-09-20T18:32:42 <stegru> nothing now, jhernandez

2018-09-20T18:35:08 <stegru> Justin_o, thinking about it.. for the pilots, I don\'t think that will be a problem
2018-09-20T18:35:20 <Justin_o> gmoss: and able to reproduce your issue.. will look into it more now

2018-09-20T09:01:44 <the-t-in-rtf> @Bosmon, nothing now, just needed to cut the release and update the infusion pull.
2018-09-20T09:02:08 <the-t-in-rtf> I sent a note so that @sgithens and others who aren\'t necessarily online will have something to remind them to upgrade.
2018-09-20T09:02:33 <the-t-in-rtf> Is anyone already working to add schema data to any of the existing settings in win32.json in universal?
2018-09-20T09:02:41 <the-t-in-rtf> I want to write up a ticket and submit a pull for those.
2018-09-20T09:21:55 <the-t-in-rtf> @bosmon, do you know of anyone working to add schema data to our "legacy" settings?
2018-09-20T09:22:15 <the-t-in-rtf> I mean all of the various products in win32.json in universal.
2018-09-20T09:23:40 <the-t-in-rtf> I don\'t see any open tickets against universal that are related, just checking before I create one.
2018-09-20T09:25:23 <the-t-in-rtf> ugh, no one is using the universal component, looking more widely now.
2018-09-20T09:28:24 <the-t-in-rtf> OK, this seems like a good candidate for me to take over: https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3095
2018-09-20T09:28:28 <the-t-in-rtf> @Bosmon
2018-09-20T09:28:49 <the-t-in-rtf> in order to internationalise we would also obviously need schema data for the rest of the settings.
2018-09-20T10:00:26 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - great
2018-09-20T10:01:03 <the-t-in-rtf> I\'m expanding the remit a bit to cover most of what we talked about last night.
2018-09-20T10:01:08 <the-t-in-rtf> I updated the ticket.

2018-09-20T11:30:49 <the-t-in-rtf> morning, just seeing where we\'re meeting.
2018-09-20T11:31:18 <the-t-in-rtf> Yes, I\'m planning to take it on.  Ideally, once I\'ve done this, anyone else onboarding will see test failures unless they include schema data.
2018-09-20T11:31:30 <the-t-in-rtf> @Bosmon, do you have Vidyo yet?
2018-09-20T11:34:11 <the-t-in-rtf> OK, let\'s start on Skype, I\'ll call whomever is online shortly.

2018-09-20T12:15:08 <georgitodorov> Bosmon, jhernandez: We have stumbled upon a very peculiar issue for which we filed a JIRA ticket: https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3390
2018-09-20T12:16:52 <georgitodorov> It is not a critical one but the behavior is a little surprising. Please take a look at it and let us know if you can reproduce it and whether you think it\'s worth fixing it :)

2018-09-20T12:49:37 <the-t-in-rtf> @stegru or anyone, is there a rational reason that one of these themes appears twice?
2018-09-20T12:49:38 <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L4819
2018-09-20T12:50:00 <the-t-in-rtf> is it just so that it can be "gray-white" and "grey-white"?
2018-09-20T12:50:17 <stegru> yes
2018-09-20T12:50:22 <the-t-in-rtf> but that makes no sense.
2018-09-20T12:50:30 <the-t-in-rtf> I mean, it\'s not meaningful.
2018-09-20T12:50:46 <stegru> feel free to remove one of them
2018-09-20T12:50:47 <the-t-in-rtf> you could safely remove the entry there, it\'s only the one in the transform that should matter.
2018-09-20T12:50:50 <the-t-in-rtf> I will do so.
2018-09-20T12:51:04 <stegru> I can\'t remember exactly why i did it
2018-09-20T12:51:16 <the-t-in-rtf> watching "GoodFellas" too many times.
2018-09-20T12:51:39 <stegru> I think it was referenced using the two different spellings in different places
2018-09-20T12:51:55 <the-t-in-rtf> yes, but the enum is spelled the same.

2018-09-20T14:31:38 <stegru> Bosmon, I did nothing
2018-09-20T14:32:24 <stegru> Justin_o, the PR is all I need for the pilots, but do whatever makes you happy.
2018-09-20T14:34:27 <stegru> I mean, the PR is the bare minimum - anything beyond that is better
2018-09-20T14:34:37 * alanharnum joined the channel
2018-09-20T14:36:18 <Justin_o> stegru: okay thanks.. i\'ll double check where I got to with it yesterday and if it\'s close I\'ll send you something to test out to see if it solves your problem. Just need to get to a couple things before that though.
2018-09-20T14:37:17 <stegru> that\'s fine, Justin_o. It\'s not a showstopper, just nice-to-have
2018-09-20T14:38:15 <Justin_o> stegru: okay.. question for you.. is there something wrong with running "vagrant up" in the windows repo. I\'m trying to test out another PR there but it keeps failing to provision the VM.
2018-09-20T14:38:47 <stegru> not that I\'m aware of, what does the failure look like?
2018-09-20T14:39:38 <Justin_o> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/qvyNdNl2/
2018-09-20T14:41:48 <Justin_o> I\'m not sure where that hash ( c9bd31120845921892623e85091ad2d97bb51a89 ) is coming from.
2018-09-20T14:42:37 * fluid-logger joined the channel
2018-09-20T14:42:37 <stegru> no, something that npm install is doing. does it keep happening?
2018-09-20T14:43:20 <Justin_o> i\'ve tried 3 times now and had the same issue. I removed my changes too, so it should have just been running from master
2018-09-20T14:47:45 <stegru> I think something like this had happened before... it was a network issue. are you at the IDRC?
2018-09-20T14:47:53 <stegru> it just worked fine for me
2018-09-20T14:50:08 <Justin_o> I\'m working from home today.. i\'m trying again now. I deleted the node_modules repo in case there was something in there that was causing a problem
2018-09-20T14:50:45 <Justin_o> but if it is a network issue that would explain why things worked when i used it yesterday.
2018-09-20T14:51:06 <Justin_o> but i can\'t remember if i had updated from master or not yesterday.
2018-09-20T14:51:52 <stegru> well, Justin_o, I\'ve just cloned a clean master and did vagrant up, and it worked
2018-09-20T14:52:51 <Justin_o> stegru: thanks.. so probably something on my end then
2018-09-20T14:53:53 * danayo_ joined the channel
2018-09-20T14:54:29 <Justin_o> stegru: it failed again for me, so probably not something to do with node_modules.. i guess it\'s a network issue.
2018-09-20T14:57:31 <jhernandez> Bosmon, cindyli: hey, I\'ve got a quick question here regarding highContrast - for feds-audit we added a new contrast theme, "regular-contrast" - do we still need this to be in place?
2018-09-20T14:59:14 <Justin_o> Bosmon: I\'ve recreated the GPII-3319 Universal PR. https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/666
2018-09-20T14:59:23 <Bosmon> jhernandez - no idea!
2018-09-20T14:59:25 <Bosmon> Why did we add it?
2018-09-20T15:00:06 <Justin_o> Bosmon: it\'s ready for review. I haven\'t been able to fully test it with UIO+ because my vagrant vm from the windows repo won\'t build for me right now.
2018-09-20T15:00:16 <jhernandez> IIRC this "regular-contrast" was to workaround the problems and sync issues (between QSS and OS) when having a pref set with highContrastEnabled but without a Theme on it
2018-09-20T15:00:20 <jhernandez> Bosmon: ^
2018-09-20T15:00:56 <Bosmon> jhernandez - I assume it is not necessary given cindyli and stegru\'s recent improvements to the solutions registry
2018-09-20T15:01:01 <Bosmon> But I guess we would need to try it out
2018-09-20T15:01:13 <jhernandez> yeah, that was my guess
2018-09-20T15:01:15 <cindyli> the new condition block in win32.json is verifying "regular-contrast" - https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L4782
2018-09-20T15:02:02 <stegru> I think it\'s for the QSS, where it selects from a list
2018-09-20T15:02:02 <cindyli> this line is for windows high contrast. the same condition at line 6213 is for UIO+

2018-09-20T15:03:26 <jhernandez> then, I\'d say we still need this in place, right?
2018-09-20T15:04:15 <stegru> yes, it makes things easier for the QSS... so the high-contrast enabled state and the theme can be set using a single preference
2018-09-20T15:04:37 <stegru> I didn\'t add it, but I agree with its use
2018-09-20T15:07:51 <cindyli> the "highContrastEnabled" term can be potentially removed ;)
2018-09-20T15:09:26 <stegru> maybe, cindyli. when setting highContrastEnabled without a theme, the last used theme is used
2018-09-20T15:10:01 <stegru> in Windows, not sure about UIO+
2018-09-20T15:10:04 <jhernandez> from our perspective, right now, that\'s true, we can remove it, but not entirely sure about the implications under the hood (MM ?)
2018-09-20T15:10:53 <jhernandez> and not only in MM but the implications in the solutions\' end, dunno
2018-09-20T15:11:51 <stegru> com.microsoft.windows.highContrast doesn\'t require it, but it does honour it
2018-09-20T15:12:31 <jhernandez> okay, will add the "regular-contrast" to the list of hc themes, I don\'t think we have to decide now on removing the highContrastEnabled term
2018-09-20T15:13:39 <cindyli> i was joking on removing highContrastEnabled term. i totally believe removing it will trigger a chain reaction ;)
2018-09-20T15:13:52 <jhernandez> hahaha
2018-09-20T15:14:23 <stegru> please keep humour out of here
2018-09-20T15:15:52 <jhernandez> heh, I\'m sure that removing highContrastEnabled would trigger some of those kasparnet\'s evil easter eggs
2018-09-20T15:15:56 <jhernandez> xDDD
2018-09-20T15:16:15 <stegru> haha
2018-09-20T15:17:05 <stegru> we need to add an easter egg
2018-09-20T15:25:25 <jhernandez> stegru: ok, and what do we do with the grey/gray discrepancies?
2018-09-20T15:25:34 <jhernandez> who\'s right?
2018-09-20T15:26:13 <stegru> grey
2018-09-20T15:27:02 <jhernandez> but you named the windows theme as "grayOnDark"

2018-09-20T15:51:09 <Bosmon> Hi there Justin_o
2018-09-20T15:51:17 <Bosmon> I\'m just trying to get everything working with the new framework again
2018-09-20T15:51:26 <Bosmon> And I\'m running into some timing issues with the prefs framework
2018-09-20T15:51:36 <Bosmon> I wonder if you remember how the compositePanels are meant to work: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/preferences/js/Panels.js#L225
2018-09-20T15:51:51 <Bosmon> I\'m noticing that there is this event here called "initSubPanels"
2018-09-20T15:52:17 <Bosmon> Which I\'m imagining is what should be used to time the construction of any panels nested in the composite
2018-09-20T15:52:24 <Bosmon> But I see that sometimes it is used, and sometimes it isn\'t
2018-09-20T15:52:54 <Bosmon> In particular the component tree constructed in BuilderTests.js for rendering doesn\'t seem to supply createOnEvent: "initSubPanels" for the nested panels
2018-09-20T15:54:02 <Bosmon> Do you think it should?
