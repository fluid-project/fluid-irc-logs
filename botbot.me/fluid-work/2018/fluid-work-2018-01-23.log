b'2018-01-23T16:58:01 <javjarfer[m]> hi Kavya ! Just pinging for knowing if you saw my mail up there, I forgot to mention
2018-01-23T17:06:42 <Kavya> yes, i just saw thanks for pinging...sent you the license key
2018-01-23T17:09:16 * clown has quit
2018-01-23T17:09:18 <javjarfer[m]> Kavya: np! thanks you!
2018-01-23T17:13:50 <javjarfer[m]> Kavya: hi! Sorry just tested the License key, and it happens to be a license key for Zoomtext Magnifier only
2018-01-23T17:13:56 <javjarfer[m]> do we have a license key for the upgraded version, Magnifier and Reader?

2018-01-23T17:37:46 <jhernandez> stegru: while integrating things, I found that I need to revert your "revert of GPII-2212"
2018-01-23T17:37:52 <jhernandez> :)
2018-01-23T17:38:22 <stegru> the language support?
2018-01-23T17:40:06 * jhung is now known as jhung_away
2018-01-23T17:40:42 <jhernandez> yup
2018-01-23T17:40:48 <jhernandez> does this looks good to you? https://github.com/javihernandez/windows/commit/f53a0e4f174e4e9cce0907ef6b3b470edab8a5b7
2018-01-23T17:42:14 <stegru> that\'s the best code I\'ve had the privilege to read, in my life
2018-01-23T17:42:53 <jhernandez> hahahaha
2018-01-23T17:43:17 <stegru> why does this need to be in, anyway?
2018-01-23T17:43:40 <jhernandez> apparently, it\'s required for the ATIA demo
2018-01-23T17:44:28 <stegru> oh ok - yeh, Kavya was expecting to test that, but then sandra said no - but that was for the pilot
2018-01-23T17:44:36 <stegru> makes sense now
2018-01-23T17:45:19 <jhernandez> and since I took over a branch that gloob created a few days ago. I found that he merged your PILOT2, which was including GPII-2212 and you then  reverted it .... and here I am right now :)
2018-01-23T17:45:25 <jhernandez> no prob
2018-01-23T17:45:29 <jhernandez> looks like it\'s there
2018-01-23T17:45:46 <jhernandez> I\'ll try whether it works
2018-01-23T17:46:04 <jhernandez> I see that it comes with a couple of NP sets, so I\'ll just test them
2018-01-23T17:46:56 <stegru> there\'s also some universal code
2018-01-23T17:48:28 <jhernandez> yup, I already took it
2018-01-23T17:48:44 * Kavya has quit
2018-01-23T17:48:51 <jhernandez> didn\'t have that revert problem with the universal branch

2018-01-23T18:29:36 <cindyli> Bosmon, colinclark: the universal repo has some tests that test the production configs:
2018-01-23T18:29:36 <cindyli> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/tests/ProductionConfigTests.js
2018-01-23T18:29:41 <cindyli> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/scripts/vagrantCloudBasedContainers.sh
2018-01-23T18:30:07 <cindyli> the latter spins up a docker image using cloudbased production config file - gpii.config.cloudBased.flowManager.production
2018-01-23T18:30:10 <Bosmon> cindyli - well, in theory it does, yes
2018-01-23T18:30:29 <cindyli> these tests require http://preferences.gpii.net running alive - https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/configs/gpii.flowManager.config.production.json#L10
2018-01-23T18:30:58 <cindyli> with my GPII-2630 change, the prefs server is no longer a standalone server. it becomes a subcomponent of the flow manager
2018-01-23T18:31:26 <cindyli> meaning there would be no https://preferences.gpii.net
2018-01-23T18:31:37 <cindyli> how do you think we should fix these tests?
2018-01-23T18:31:55 <cindyli> these tests only assume the prefs server running alive, but still starts the flow manager locally
2018-01-23T18:32:19 <cindyli> if i remove the use of the live prefs server, these tests become equally as testing the dev congis
2018-01-23T18:32:24 <cindyli> typo - configs
2018-01-23T18:33:06 <cindyli> any idea?
2018-01-23T18:35:52 <cindyli> Bosmon: ^
2018-01-23T18:42:06 <Bosmon> cindyli - what will there be rather than preferences.gpii.net?
2018-01-23T18:42:31 <cindyli> Bosmon: there would be only one cloud based flow manager
2018-01-23T18:42:36 <cindyli> running as a server
2018-01-23T18:42:44 <Bosmon> cindyli - what is its name?
2018-01-23T18:42:59 <cindyli> i guess flowmanager.gpii.net
2018-01-23T18:43:33 <cindyli> are you thinking to deploy the flow manager as a live remote server and have these tests interacting with it?
2018-01-23T18:43:45 <Bosmon> cindyli - I think that is clearly necessary, right?
2018-01-23T18:43:51 <Bosmon> These tests must test what we actually plan to deploy
2018-01-23T18:44:07 <cindyli> i\'m not sure why our current tests are not using the live flow manager but only the live prefs server
2018-01-23T18:44:20 <Bosmon> cindyli - because they are old and incompletely conceived :)
2018-01-23T18:44:28 <cindyli> haha ok
2018-01-23T18:44:35 <Bosmon> It was always the plan, once we mastered the docker configuration, etc., to start writing more tests that tested more servers
2018-01-23T18:45:47 <cindyli> do you think if I should get the help from the ops team to start to deploy the GPII-2630 version of the flow manager, so I can fix these tests, Bosmon
2018-01-23T18:45:56 <Bosmon> cindyli - I think you should
2018-01-23T18:46:10 <cindyli> ok, thanks, Bosmon
2018-01-23T18:46:54 <cindyli> colinclark: do you think who is the right person from the ops team to pair up with me?
2018-01-23T18:47:39 <colinclark> i can respond to this in a few minutes, cindyli
2018-01-23T18:47:45 <cindyli> thanks
2018-01-23T18:47:46 <colinclark> I\'m just in the midst of the ops team\'s sprint planning
2018-01-23T18:47:59 <Bosmon> Yes, I definitely agree you should pair up with WHO :)
2018-01-23T18:48:15 <cindyli> who is WHO
2018-01-23T18:48:24 <cindyli> is this another joke
2018-01-23T18:48:34 <Bosmon> The one who you thought was the right person :)
2018-01-23T18:48:34 <colinclark> can someone provide a one-sentence summary of what the work is that we\'ll need the ops team to help with?
2018-01-23T18:48:41 <colinclark> and then I\'ll catch up on the whole discussion after the meeting
2018-01-23T18:49:21 <cindyli> colinclark: deploy the GPII-2630 version of the flow manager, which has the prefs server as a subcomponent
2018-01-23T18:49:35 <Bosmon> cindyli - the ops team might need a slightly higher-level description than that
2018-01-23T18:49:45 <Bosmon> E.g. what the purpose of this component is, what endpoints it exposes, etc.
2018-01-23T18:50:20 <Bosmon> And also expanded for "deployed for what purpose"
2018-01-23T18:50:31 <cindyli> ok, adding more description:
2018-01-23T18:50:48 <Bosmon> THat is, what will be the service level of this deployment, its lifecycle, availability, and security status of its persisted data
2018-01-23T18:51:02 <cindyli> oh man
2018-01-23T18:51:11 <Bosmon> Yeah
2018-01-23T18:51:16 <Bosmon> Talking across teams is tough :)
2018-01-23T18:51:51 <cindyli> i will try but not sure i could answer all these questions, such as the lifecycle
2018-01-23T18:52:35 <cindyli> 1. with the implementation of the new data model: https://wiki.gpii.net/w/Keys,_KeyTokens,_and_Preferences, GPII will no longer have the prefs server running as a standalone server, instead, it will become a subcomponent of the flow manager
2018-01-23T18:52:43 <Bosmon> That\'s fine, I\'m sure the ops team can fill in the blanks from partial answers
2018-01-23T18:53:26 <cindyli> 2. the prefs server will share the same couch db with the auth server, and this new database is called "gpii"
2018-01-23T18:54:21 <cindyli> 3. https://preferences.gpii.net is no longer needed. in the cloud, GPII only has the cloud based flow manager: https://flowmanager.gpii.net
2018-01-23T18:55:32 <cindyli> 4. as we talked before, there might be different stage of the cloud based flow manager needed serving different purposes, such as testing, staging, production. of course, there would be different name for them
2018-01-23T18:57:13 <cindyli> 5. for now, what i need is the live flow manager running for testing purpose, so I can fix the production config tests in my GPII-2630 branch. this flow manager should be deployed using the config file from my GPII-2630 branch and available all the time
2018-01-23T18:57:52 <cindyli> it only provides secured endpoints such as /untrusted-settings
2018-01-23T18:59:28 <cindyli> that\'s what i can think of. ask me if anything is unclear
2018-01-23T19:04:56 * jhung_away is now known as jhung
2018-01-23T19:22:09 <cindyli> Bosmon: one production config test tests trusted flowmanager config - https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/tests/ProductionConfigTests.js#L75. what is the trusted flow manager?
2018-01-23T19:22:47 <cindyli> does it run locally?
2018-01-23T19:23:24 <cindyli> do we need to continue to test its production config?

2018-01-23T20:14:54 <Bosmon> I would prefer to keep testing it
2018-01-23T20:15:03 <Bosmon> But in terms of our recent religion, the suggestion might be to destroy it
2018-01-23T20:15:22 <Bosmon> Personally, I think that would be terrible, and remove all suggestions that we actually have a flexible architecture
2018-01-23T20:15:26 <Bosmon> But let\'s talk about that tomorrow

2018-01-23T11:52:31 <javjarfer[m]> hi stegru !
2018-01-23T11:52:38 <stegru> hello!
2018-01-23T11:54:02 <javjarfer[m]> good morning, I\'m not going to use right now that I was asking you again for the demo, but,  did you know if that strings are in fact being parsed by the \'registrySettingsHandler\'?
2018-01-23T11:54:27 <javjarfer[m]> because It looks like they receive a special treatment
2018-01-23T11:54:34 <stegru> oh yeh?
2018-01-23T11:54:54 <stegru> they\'re just being return as-as, as far as i\'m aware
2018-01-23T11:55:25 <javjarfer[m]> they are being parsed and returned?
2018-01-23T11:55:48 <stegru> no parsing, what is it you\'re seeing?
2018-01-23T11:56:41 <javjarfer[m]> I have modified the gpii.launch.exec for printing me what it\'s receiving and I\'m getting a terrible \'undefined\'
2018-01-23T11:56:56 <javjarfer[m]> (fear the undef)
2018-01-23T11:57:07 <stegru> well, does the key exist?
2018-01-23T11:57:33 <stegru> what happens if you do something like: cmd.exe /k echo ${registry...}
2018-01-23T11:57:48 <javjarfer[m]> yes, it\'s located in the 64 bit part of the registry, I have check trying to get Narrator one, which for example is inside the WOW folder
2018-01-23T11:57:56 <javjarfer[m]> and it gets the value
2018-01-23T11:58:05 <javjarfer[m]> but, I\'m not being able to reproduce with the other key
2018-01-23T11:58:09 <stegru> what\'s the key?
2018-01-23T11:59:00 <javjarfer[m]> "SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Accessibility\\ATs\\AiSquared_ZoomText_v11\\StartExe"
2018-01-23T11:59:36 <javjarfer[m]> it\'s the exact same \'location\' until "AiSquared_Zom.." than narrator\'s one, but, narrator ones is duplicated in the 32 bit part of the registry
2018-01-23T12:00:17 <javjarfer[m]> I\'m launching it directly without getting the key, but would be good being able of doing it from there, it\'s our more standard approach
2018-01-23T12:00:28 <stegru> yeh
2018-01-23T12:00:35 <javjarfer[m]> for the demos I\'m skipping it, until we know why isn\'t working
2018-01-23T12:00:58 <stegru> what if you do 64:SOFTWARE\\Microsoft... ?
2018-01-23T12:01:09 <javjarfer[m]> undefined
2018-01-23T12:01:25 <javjarfer[m]> well, without the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE?
2018-01-23T12:01:45 <stegru> it will be HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\64:SOFTWARE\\Microsoft
2018-01-23T12:01:54 <javjarfer[m]> undefined
2018-01-23T12:02:55 <stegru> you\'re escaping the back slashes?
2018-01-23T12:03:26 <javjarfer[m]> yes, I will paste you exactly how I was trying it
2018-01-23T12:04:10 <stegru> oh wait.. you can try to start is using enableRegisteredAT
2018-01-23T12:04:42 <stegru> copy the magnifier or onscreen keyboard, and use "AiSquared_ZoomText_v1" for the name
2018-01-23T12:04:59 <stegru> v11
2018-01-23T12:05:14 <javjarfer[m]> "command": ""${{registry}.HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\64:SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Accessibility\\ATs\\AiSquared_ZoomText_v11\\StartExe\\}""
2018-01-23T12:05:25 <javjarfer[m]> that was the exact command
2018-01-23T12:05:39 <stegru> you need to double the backslashes
2018-01-23T12:05:56 <javjarfer[m]> > oh wait.. you can try to start is using enableRegisteredAT
2018-01-23T12:05:57 <javjarfer[m]> I thought about that, but didn\'t knew how to do it, and I need to implement several stuff for today
2018-01-23T12:06:22 <javjarfer[m]> > you need to double the backslashes
2018-01-23T12:06:22 <javjarfer[m]> yes they are doubled has been escaped by my IRC client, don\'t know why
2018-01-23T12:06:27 <stegru> ah ok
2018-01-23T12:07:24 <stegru> try this: https://pastebin.com/cLwPmW5c
2018-01-23T12:08:24 <stegru> when you start a program in that registry location, it does some other stuff.. like adding it to the lock-screen
2018-01-23T12:08:51 <stegru> so when you kill the program, it needs to do some things to remove itself from the lock-screen
2018-01-23T12:09:42 <javjarfer[m]> mm that looks important even for the demo
2018-01-23T12:09:50 <javjarfer[m]> but that isn\'t working too
2018-01-23T12:10:19 <stegru> i don\'t know why the registry value isn\'t being read
2018-01-23T12:11:20 <javjarfer[m]> enableRegsitryAT takes into account registry address space?
2018-01-23T12:12:59 * gtirloni joined the channel
2018-01-23T12:13:59 <javjarfer[m]> stegru: it looks like it doesn\'t
2018-01-23T12:14:21 <javjarfer[m]> well, maybe making the necessary changes there is more trivial than in the other place  (command parsing stuff)
2018-01-23T12:14:27 * stegru has quit
2018-01-23T12:14:34 <javjarfer[m]> will take a look at that this afternoon, and see how it goes

2018-01-23T14:18:19 <cindyli> Bosmon: might because my 8081 port is in use, let me try again
2018-01-23T14:20:13 <cindyli> works, false alarm, sorry Bosmon

2018-01-23T14:43:05 <dandimitrov> Hey, Bosmon! About the dialog topic again - we\'re still missing something about the `isShown` in the model approach. As we discussed there will be a simple `modelListener` on the `isShown` property that will either show or hide the dialog depending on the `isShown` property value.
2018-01-23T14:43:15 <dandimitrov> But what if we want to have a more generic dialog component, that allows its show and hide functionality to be easily altered (overridden)? In the current implementation, this can happen easily by providing a new implementation for the show/hide invokers. How can this be achieved if we are to use the modelized approach? Shall we override the model listener for the `isShown` property for every descendant?
2018-01-23T14:43:24 <dandimitrov> Another concern for us in general is that for consistency reason this modification will lead to some significant changes. This applies especially to this component: https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/pull/27/files#diff-bc658f47466ba31df21972f46d3f02d4R148.
2018-01-23T14:43:31 <dandimitrov> A possibility would be to keep the current `show` and `hide` invokers [ https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/pull/27/files#diff-d0ba4867f6caa289ae0e4ae677c8ff75R104 ] and use them in the modelListener for the `isShown` property. However, in this case we would need to always ensure that the proper state of the `isShown` flag is set by changing the flag accordingly in these methods (including their overridden versions).

2018-01-23T14:50:31 <Bosmon> dandimitrov - yes, the benefit of having namespaced modelListeners is that they can be overridden individually, just as with invokers
2018-01-23T14:51:18 <Bosmon> So the convention that we have in some places is for the modelListener which actually materialises some effect of the model outside the component to be given the namespace "impl"
2018-01-23T14:52:09 <Bosmon> I think in practice you won\'t need too many changes
2018-01-23T14:52:27 <Bosmon> What is your concern about the restartWarningController?

2018-01-23T15:25:23 <dandimitrov> Bosmon, is replacing `{dialog}.hide` (or `show`) to something like `{dialog}.change.applier("isShown", false)` (and to `true` for `show` accordingly) the right way of moving to the new approach?
2018-01-23T15:26:16 <Bosmon> dandimitrov - yes, although there is a dedicated syntax for triggering changes declaratively - https://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/ChangeApplierAPI.html#declarative-style-for-triggering-a-change

2018-01-23T15:36:09 <dandimitrov> Great, thank you, Bosmon. We were rather unsure of the amount of changes that will be required in general, but we\'ll try to make these namespaced modelListeners work and ask if something else comes up :)
2018-01-23T15:36:21 <Bosmon> dandimitrov - awesome, thanks

2018-01-23T16:07:16 <Kavya> Hi
2018-01-23T16:08:21 <javjarfer[m]> Good afternoon, do you know if we have any license key for zoomtext 11?
2018-01-23T16:08:42 <Kavya> Yes we have
2018-01-23T16:09:09 <javjarfer[m]> oh, that\'s great, could you please give me one?
2018-01-23T16:09:21 <Kavya> Will send you an email with the key
2018-01-23T16:09:44 <javjarfer[m]> It looks like some features are disabled if you don\'t have the full version, but I can\'t really tell, because I don\'t have it xD
2018-01-23T16:09:54 <javjarfer[m]> thanks you!
2018-01-23T16:16:15 <jhung> fluid-everyone: planning meeting will be at 11:30a.

2018-01-23T16:22:48 <jhernandez> not working?
2018-01-23T16:22:53 <stegru> it\'s not perfect
2018-01-23T16:22:56 <jhernandez> okay
2018-01-23T16:23:14 <jhernandez> then let me know when it\'s ready to go
2018-01-23T16:23:35 <jhernandez> or even if it\'s not possible with the new approach
2018-01-23T16:41:39 <stegru> jhernandez: got it working now.. https://github.com/stegru/gpii-wix-installer/tree/PILOT2
2018-01-23T16:42:20 <jhernandez> stegru: okay, thanks
2018-01-23T16:42:35 <stegru> do you have a branch I can point a PR to?
2018-01-23T16:42:54 <jhernandez> not yet
2018-01-23T16:43:14 <jhernandez> don\'t worry, I can take it from where it is now
2018-01-23T16:43:21 <stegru> ok
2018-01-23T16:43:23 <jhernandez> ;)
2018-01-23T16:46:19 <stegru> I have a PR for gpii-app that points to the pilot2 branch for the installer, that\'s what I\'m building in CI now
2018-01-23T16:48:03 <stegru> javjarfer[m]: FYI, here\'s what I\'ve done with your UIA file: https://github.com/stegru/gpii-wix-installer/blob/PILOT2/setup/trayicon-uia.cs
2018-01-23T16:48:44 <stegru> I don\'t think I had to change anything you wrote
2018-01-23T16:49:21 <javjarfer[m]> stegru: looks very clean, for the windows hiding part and positioning
2018-01-23T16:49:40 <javjarfer[m]> looks like something we could do with more applications if we have the need
2018-01-23T16:50:15 <javjarfer[m]> > I don\'t think I had to change anything you wrote
2018-01-23T16:50:16 <javjarfer[m]> that is nice, no more freezing?
2018-01-23T16:50:26 <stegru> yeh, i didn\'t like the look of the automation.. it looks like someone had hacked the computer, or something
2018-01-23T16:50:40 <stegru> i just added a few Sleeps
2018-01-23T16:52:25 <stegru> not sure if you see this, but the settings window is blue when it first loads.. your code froze if it ran while it was blue
