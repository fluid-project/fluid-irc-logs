2018-06-26T11:03:02 <the-t-in-rtf1> So, @stegru or anyone who frequently works with Windows, how do you tend to test settings payloads?
2018-06-26T11:03:18 <the-t-in-rtf1> Say you have a new setting that\'s on or off and you want to test it.
2018-06-26T11:03:40 <the-t-in-rtf1> do you add it to a test settings file or something?
2018-06-26T11:03:42 <stegru> i have a test preference set which I play with
2018-06-26T11:03:45 <stegru> yes
2018-06-26T11:03:56 <the-t-in-rtf1> And, stupid question, how do you activate that preference set?
2018-06-26T11:03:58 <the-t-in-rtf1> API call?
2018-06-26T11:04:03 <the-t-in-rtf1> hidden menu option?
2018-06-26T11:04:15 <stegru> using the url
2018-06-26T11:04:23 <the-t-in-rtf1> Great, API call, got it.
2018-06-26T11:04:28 <the-t-in-rtf1> just with a browser?
2018-06-26T11:04:34 <stegru> curl
2018-06-26T11:04:39 <stegru> but a browser is ok
2018-06-26T11:04:50 <the-t-in-rtf1> I\'m working in a VM, so the less I have to install, the better.
2018-06-26T11:05:09 <stegru> ah well, I invoke it from the host to the VM
2018-06-26T11:05:34 <the-t-in-rtf1> right.
2018-06-26T11:06:22 <stegru> i just disable the firewall in the vm, and I can access it directly from the outside
2018-06-26T11:06:33 <stegru> but that doesn\'t matter how you do it
2018-06-26T11:07:16 <stegru> you\'ll also need to run: `npm run postinstall` when you modify any preference files
2018-06-26T11:15:40 <the-t-in-rtf1> thanks, that\'s good to know.
2018-06-26T11:15:53 <the-t-in-rtf1> So, there are dozens of settings files in the testData dir.
2018-06-26T11:16:02 <the-t-in-rtf1> is there any one you tend to start with as a template?
2018-06-26T11:17:24 <the-t-in-rtf1> Also, just to confirm, we never actually test any behavioural changes in JAWS, only that we can set and get a value in the registry or an ini file?
2018-06-26T11:17:32 <the-t-in-rtf1> I mean, there are JAWS tests, but we definitely don\'t install that.
2018-06-26T11:24:54 <javjarfer[m]> > I mean, there are JAWS tests, but we definitely don\'t install that.
2018-06-26T11:24:55 <javjarfer[m]> Yes, I see what you mean, testing need to be done manually, installing the JAWS version and testing the preferences set for the test user
2018-06-26T11:26:01 <the-t-in-rtf1> Yes, since I\'m onboarding 50+ badly documented options, I actually want to confirm what they do.
2018-06-26T11:26:33 <the-t-in-rtf1> I can do them manually in a single settings file for now.
2018-06-26T11:26:44 <the-t-in-rtf1> Eventually I\'m thinking I\'d test using Steve\'s work.
2018-06-26T11:26:59 <the-t-in-rtf1> as I\'ll have to learn to use it well enough to replace its brain with the Live Solutions Registry at some point.
2018-06-26T11:27:21 <the-t-in-rtf1> Has anyone tried our JAWS settings lately?
2018-06-26T11:27:28 <the-t-in-rtf1> For starters the version is now 18.0
2018-06-26T11:27:53 <the-t-in-rtf1> Does anyone know what version is installed at the AJCs?
2018-06-26T11:27:59 <the-t-in-rtf1> @Bosmon? ^^^

2018-06-26T15:18:51 <javjarfer[m]> hi everyone, I have been onboarding a feature for windows 10 for turning on audio description of  videos when it\'s available
2018-06-26T15:20:07 <javjarfer[m]> the problem, I can\'t find any video on the internet that isn\'t a ripped version without those additional audio descriptions streams, does anybody knows or have access to videos with that kind of content?
2018-06-26T15:20:25 <javjarfer[m]> would be cool to have at least one we can use to test the feature

2018-06-26T16:07:41 <the-t-in-rtf1> @javjarfer, if it works with browsers, there are descriptive videos on youtube.
2018-06-26T16:08:05 <the-t-in-rtf1> not sure how you\'d really test the feature other than with  your eyeballs, I assume that\'s what you mean?
2018-06-26T16:08:31 <the-t-in-rtf1> well, in this case, I guess with your ears.
2018-06-26T16:08:49 <the-t-in-rtf1> I guess you could compare the audio of two plays, one with, one without?
2018-06-26T16:10:01 * danayo has quit
2018-06-26T16:13:51 <the-t-in-rtf1> Hmm, not sure how much YouTube actually supports it.
2018-06-26T16:16:36 <javjarfer[m]> Yes, that is the issue, first, we don\'t know if the feature is supported by browsers, and less by specific services in browsers
2018-06-26T16:17:08 <javjarfer[m]> most of the time the videos with description are just videos that have a embedded description, something you can\'t turn on/off
2018-06-26T16:17:25 <javjarfer[m]> I think non mainstream service supports this feature right now

2018-06-26T17:07:26 <the-t-in-rtf1> I have only ever seen it in paid services and optical media.
2018-06-26T17:07:28 <the-t-in-rtf1> I have quite a few.
2018-06-26T17:07:34 <the-t-in-rtf1> but none that are purely digital.
2018-06-26T17:07:51 <the-t-in-rtf1> The YouTube approach seems to be, make a version with that audio, it\'s not a layer or anything.
2018-06-26T17:08:30 <the-t-in-rtf1> but let me look at their translations section a bit more, maybe there\'s hope there.
2018-06-26T17:09:59 <the-t-in-rtf1> Hmm, the translations are just the metadata and subtitles.
2018-06-26T17:13:19 <the-t-in-rtf1> Just checked, vimeo doesn\'t support multiple audio tracks either.
