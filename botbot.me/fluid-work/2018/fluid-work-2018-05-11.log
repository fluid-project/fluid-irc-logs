2018-05-11T08:51:37 <georgitodorov> Bosmon2, the-t-in-rtf: Hey there! We were wondering if the following PR will be merged soon: https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/pull/44
2018-05-11T08:52:04 <georgitodorov> In that PR some of the linting problems that come from the new linter have been addressed by Tony
2018-05-11T08:52:25 <georgitodorov> And we want to address the remaining ones in our PR for PSP3
2018-05-11T08:52:48 <georgitodorov> And that is why we think it would be better for Tony\'s branch to go into master first.
2018-05-11T09:00:56 <the-t-in-rtf> Howdy.
2018-05-11T09:01:18 <the-t-in-rtf> As far as I know it\'s ready.  If @Bosmon2 or anyone else finds differently, let me know.
2018-05-11T09:01:43 <the-t-in-rtf> My son has the chicken pox and I\'m at home with him, but I can find an hour if there\'s anything blocking the merge.

2018-05-11T10:25:32 <georgitodorov> the-t-in-rtf: By the way, I am still getting the error that the "coverage-tests-<TIMESTAMP>.json" file cannot be created
2018-05-11T10:26:01 <georgitodorov> When I remove the timestamp and create the file manually in the coverage folder, everything is fine
2018-05-11T10:26:09 <georgitodorov> Is this issue happening only on my machine?
2018-05-11T10:35:28 <the-t-in-rtf> Thanks for pointing that out, I\'ll look at it in a minute.
2018-05-11T10:35:48 <the-t-in-rtf> I have been focused on the main tests for a while and haven\'t run the cover command in a bit.
2018-05-11T11:05:48 * gtirloni joined the channel
2018-05-11T11:26:56 <the-t-in-rtf> OK, the problem is clearly that the coverage dir doesn\'t exist in the repo.  Rather than commit an empty dir, I\'ll add a step to make that if needed.
2018-05-11T11:56:09 <the-t-in-rtf> @Bosmon2, @georgitodorov: https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/pull/44#issuecomment-388342738
2018-05-11T11:56:39 <the-t-in-rtf> the coverage commands should now run whether or not you\'ve created a coverage dir locally.
2018-05-11T11:58:36 * gtirloni joined the channel
2018-05-11T11:58:43 <georgitodorov> the-t-in-rtf: I still get the familiar error:
2018-05-11T11:58:48 <georgitodorov> 14:58:09.188:  Error saving coverage data:{
2018-05-11T11:58:49 <georgitodorov> "errno": -4058,
2018-05-11T11:58:49 <georgitodorov> "code": "ENOENT",

2018-05-11T11:58:49 <georgitodorov> }
2018-05-11T11:59:09 <the-t-in-rtf> did you run npm install after pulling the changes?
2018-05-11T11:59:16 <georgitodorov> I think that the problem is with the creation of the json file itself, not with the directory
2018-05-11T11:59:37 <georgitodorov> Yes, I did and the mkdirp module was installed successfully
2018-05-11T11:59:40 <the-t-in-rtf> I don\'t see anything like that in the VM.
2018-05-11T11:59:42 <the-t-in-rtf> it\'s very odd.
2018-05-11T12:00:38 <georgitodorov> the-t-in-rtf: If I manually create the json, everything works fine (but I omit the timestamp portion of the filename)
2018-05-11T12:01:58 <the-t-in-rtf> That\'s just odd, all I\'m using is node fs.
2018-05-11T12:02:25 <the-t-in-rtf> I also have no idea why this would fail in a local machine but not the VM.
2018-05-11T12:02:37 <georgitodorov> the-t-in-rtf: Maybe the problem is just on my machine
2018-05-11T12:02:44 <the-t-in-rtf> @Bosmon2, does the coverage report run for you?

2018-05-11T12:57:10 <the-t-in-rtf> Sigh, the previous commit\'s build finally finished after an hour.  Hopefully the next one (which will include coverage reporting) will finish soon.

2018-05-11T13:13:08 <cindyli> hi Bosmon2, regarding this comment - https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/591#discussion_r187452460, do you mean to use convert all config json files to json5, and combine the readme into json5?

2018-05-11T13:58:30 <the-t-in-rtf> @georgitodorov and @Bosmon2, the gpii-app CI coverage run failed with a message bundling failure: https://ci.gpii.net/job/gpii-app-test/230/console
2018-05-11T13:58:48 <the-t-in-rtf> Do I need to do anything in particular to ensure that\'s built?
2018-05-11T14:02:14 <georgitodorov> the-t-in-rtf: You need to add `npm run build` as a first step in the `test` command in the package.json
2018-05-11T14:02:29 <georgitodorov> Similarly to how it is done in the `test:noCoverage`

2018-05-11T14:41:45 <Justin_o> gtirloni: i\'m looking at the FestivalTextToSpeechService PR
2018-05-11T14:42:06 <Justin_o> when i run https://tts.idrc.ocadu.ca/?q=hello%20world in safari or chrome it doesn\'t seem to know what the file is. In firefox it figures it out
2018-05-11T14:42:20 <Justin_o> do you know if that is how it was prior to the change?
2018-05-11T14:42:28 <gtirloni> yep, it was like that before
2018-05-11T14:42:41 <Justin_o> :( oh well
2018-05-11T14:42:43 <Justin_o> thanks
2018-05-11T14:42:55 <gtirloni> probably missing the content-type :(
2018-05-11T14:43:00 <Justin_o> yah i think so
2018-05-11T14:43:40 <Justin_o> the exploration tool is pretty buggy for the TTS integration, but I guess it was an early implementation
2018-05-11T14:44:25 <Justin_o> gtirloni: also, out of curiosity, how does the github repo relate to what is deployed. Just asking because you have deployed the instance without the PR being merged.
2018-05-11T14:44:59 <gtirloni> there\'s no CI process for TTS so i just pushed it manually
2018-05-11T14:45:17 <Justin_o> ah okay
2018-05-11T14:45:34 <Justin_o> well i guess i\'ll merge it in and archive it again
2018-05-11T14:45:41 <gtirloni> ok, thanks!

2018-05-11T15:10:04 <stegru> jhernandez: I don\'t think it\'s worth it, having it so you keep the tag pressed on the vaio
2018-05-11T15:10:24 <jhernandez> stegru: yes, I agree with you
2018-05-11T15:10:58 <stegru> in that case, my estimate is: 0 minutes
2018-05-11T15:11:26 <jhernandez> but, then it means that if one person uses the proximity listener to key-in, leaves the machine, and then another person comes with a USB key, he won\'t be able to key-in
2018-05-11T15:11:35 <stegru> ohh
2018-05-11T15:11:50 <jhernandez> (since the previous person forgot to kkey-out)
2018-05-11T15:11:53 <stegru> yes, that is an issue
2018-05-11T15:11:56 <jhernandez> do you know what I mean?
2018-05-11T15:11:58 <jhernandez> okay
2018-05-11T15:11:59 <stegru> yeh
2018-05-11T15:12:07 <stegru> is that what currently happens?
2018-05-11T15:12:10 <jhernandez> yes
2018-05-11T15:12:14 <stegru> damn
2018-05-11T15:12:19 <jhernandez> that\'s what i was asking about
2018-05-11T15:12:57 <jhernandez> now, switching between the external usb nfc listener and usb key works perfect
2018-05-11T15:14:18 <jhernandez> however, if I key-in using the proximity and then the external usb nfc reader, it works
2018-05-11T15:14:53 <jhernandez> that\'s why I\'m wondering whether it\'s something specifically related to the way the usb listener works
2018-05-11T15:14:53 <stegru> ok
2018-05-11T15:14:55 <jhernandez> \xc2\xbf?
2018-05-11T15:15:29 <stegru> it\'s something to do with the "detect if the user wants to tap or keep"
2018-05-11T15:16:33 <jhernandez> who knows what the user wants?! xDDD
2018-05-11T15:28:03 <the-t-in-rtf> Thanks, @georgitodorov
