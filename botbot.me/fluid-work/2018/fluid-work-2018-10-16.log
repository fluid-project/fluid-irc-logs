2018-10-16T07:41:19 <georgitodorov> jhernandez: Hey, Javi! I have been investigating the failing ajc3 build and I have found out what had caused the issue
2018-10-16T07:41:57 <georgitodorov> In this particular situation tests proved particularly useful
2018-10-16T07:44:12 <georgitodorov> The build was failing because of a hanging test when keying in an invalid user. Previously, the onKeyInFail error was not sent by the Core to the GPII app and thus the GPII app had to trigger it manually
2018-10-16T07:44:52 <georgitodorov> Now it appears that the error is indeed sent by the Core but the GPII app has not been updated accordingly
2018-10-16T07:45:38 <georgitodorov> And as a result two error dialogs were showing up which caused the test to fail. I will fix it soon in our branch and you can then merge it into the ajc3 branch
2018-10-16T07:45:49 <georgitodorov> I will also update the `gpii-windows` reference in our branch
2018-10-16T08:28:33 <georgitodorov> jhernandez: I pushed the changes into our feature/QSS1.1 branch and the CI job has passed. So you can merge them into the ajc3 branch

2018-10-16T09:26:10 <jhernandez> great, thanks for taking a look at it
2018-10-16T09:26:13 <jhernandez> :)
2018-10-16T09:27:45 <jhernandez> updating now
2018-10-16T09:40:44 <georgitodorov> jhernandez: Sure, no problem. I will be adding some more tests shortly but they need not be merged into the ajc3 branch
2018-10-16T09:42:52 <jhernandez> georgitodorov: great, thanks for the heads up
2018-10-16T09:49:07 <georgitodorov> Hey, Bosmon. Quick question - in a new test I am trying to key in with the "empty" user that I created a few days ago. But the key in operation fails with a 401 error
2018-10-16T09:50:05 <georgitodorov> However, when I manually start the app and key in with the user (i.e. outside of tests), everything is fine for this user - key in and key out
2018-10-16T09:50:49 <georgitodorov> Any ideas what I am missing?
2018-10-16T10:01:22 <jhernandez> georgitodorov: which universal config are you using for the test?
2018-10-16T10:01:31 * kasper joined the channel
2018-10-16T10:01:54 <georgitodorov> jhernandez: gpii.config.untrusted.development.all.local.json5
2018-10-16T10:03:24 <jhernandez> and when you start the app, you\'re using the samee "all.local" config, right?
2018-10-16T10:04:38 * kasper has quit
2018-10-16T10:06:33 <jhernandez> or are you using the non "all.local" config and setting the GPII_CLOUD_URL env variable before running the gpii?

2018-10-16T10:07:10 <georgitodorov> jhernandez: no, we are using gpii.config.untrusted.development.dynamicDR.all.local for running the app

2018-10-16T12:10:02 <georgitodorov> stegru or anyone: In the last but one GPII app build there was the following test failure in CI:
2018-10-16T12:10:19 <georgitodorov> 04:01:55.113:  jq: Test concluded - Module "Windows Display Settings Handler Tests" Test name "Testing setScreenDpi ": 3/6 passed - FAIL
2018-10-16T12:10:27 <georgitodorov> Full log is here: https://ci.gpii.net/job/gpii-app-test/368/consoleText
2018-10-16T12:10:45 <georgitodorov> When I triggered the build again, everything passed successfully
2018-10-16T12:11:39 <georgitodorov> Can someone take a look at this? This is the first time I have seen these particular tests fail.
2018-10-16T12:12:38 <stegru> let\'s not worry about it for now, georgitodorov.. it\'s probably due to something external to the code

2018-10-16T12:18:55 <jhernandez> stegru: +1 - can\'t tell exactly the reasons for those failures, looks like it\'s random and external to the code as you said
2018-10-16T12:20:37 <jhernandez> Bosmon: FYI, after applying the last changes from georgitodorov, we\'re getting the same (success) test results in our electron3 pr
2018-10-16T12:21:38 <jhernandez> however, I\'d like to build an installer and see if I\'m getting the same slowness I experienced on Friday night
2018-10-16T12:29:42 <georgitodorov> jhernandez: I am now testing your Electron 3.0.2 branch on my VM after some struggling to install everything
2018-10-16T12:30:04 <georgitodorov> And it does seem that there is some slowness - especially when opening a QSS menu
2018-10-16T12:30:28 <jhernandez> georgitodorov: great, thanks for giving it a try
2018-10-16T12:30:49 <jhernandez> and yes, I experienced some general slowness, but not sure exactly what it\'s about
2018-10-16T12:31:09 <georgitodorov> jhernandez: I will continue testing this
2018-10-16T12:32:03 * dandimitrov has quit
2018-10-16T12:32:23 <jhernandez> I could reduce some of it after deleting this debug line https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/pull/63/commits/bdf460d56d3faa3b64a5206e0562c5d90517b9e1#diff-bc658f47466ba31df21972f46d3f02d4R578

2018-10-16T12:34:14 <jhernandez> sounds weird, but I was getting a lot of output in the console and probably this was contributing to the slowness
2018-10-16T12:35:13 <jhernandez> but yeah, opening a QSS menu takes longer than usually, not sure why

2018-10-16T13:13:40 <cindyli> Bosmon: I need your suggestion again. The reason that turning off highContrast defined in defaultSettings.json5 triggers an error is because windows repo expects the "settings" block looks like: https://github.com/GPII/windows/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/spiSettingsHandler/test/testHighContrast.json#L18-L21
2018-10-16T13:13:57 <cindyli> the path the error complaints about missing is the one at line 20
2018-10-16T13:14:40 <cindyli> however, even if I changed the defaultSettings.json5 to have the "settings" block defined with the path, the error still occurs.
2018-10-16T13:15:02 <cindyli> this is because this line in the lifecycle manager will transform the settings block https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/lifecycleManager/src/LifecycleManager.js#L1008
2018-10-16T13:15:28 <cindyli> back to - settings: {"highContrastOn": false}
2018-10-16T13:16:35 <cindyli> the "path" gets removed again. it will be the transformed settings reaching windows code
2018-10-16T13:17:07 <cindyli> my question is, which end should we fix? windows repo or lifecycle manager?
2018-10-16T13:21:18 <Bosmon> cindyli - does this mean that the journal restore system will also fail in the case of restoring a snapshot containing such a SR element, such as high contrast?
2018-10-16T13:21:44 <cindyli> i believe so, but haven\'t tried
2018-10-16T13:21:57 <Bosmon> cindyli - seems plausible that it would fail
2018-10-16T13:22:12 <Bosmon> IN which case this section of the LifecycleManager logic needs to be fixed in order to preserve the "path" information
2018-10-16T13:22:43 <Bosmon> Although really the way all of this logic is structured is a little silly, and in the long run we should just fetch the SR entries again for this material
2018-10-16T13:23:00 <Bosmon> But we can perform that fix once it is time for you to implement your "use preferences docs rather than snapshots" fix
2018-10-16T13:23:25 <Bosmon> Since we will inevitably go through another round of matchmaking using the PrivateMatchmaker, we can use that opportunity to fetch the missing SR material
2018-10-16T13:23:37 <Bosmon> But it seems quicker for now just to fix line 1008 to not trash the additional fields
2018-10-16T13:25:01 <cindyli> ok. thanks
2018-10-16T13:25:17 <Bosmon> cindyli - actually I remember now that sgithens had complained of this property of the SpiSettingsHandler
2018-10-16T13:25:28 <Bosmon> And we had realised that the proper fix is to move "path" into the options block
2018-10-16T13:26:28 <Bosmon> But given we have to produce an installer pretty soon I expect we don\'t have time to fix the settingsHandler, which we should do together with stegru
2018-10-16T13:26:30 <cindyli> Bosmon: the options block of solution registry?
2018-10-16T13:26:33 <cindyli> it\'s already there
2018-10-16T13:26:52 <cindyli> ok, i will fix 1008 for now
2018-10-16T13:26:59 <Bosmon> cindyli - I mean this path value: https://github.com/GPII/windows/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/spiSettingsHandler/test/testHighContrast.json#L20
2018-10-16T13:27:09 <cindyli> hope it won\'t break other parts badly, such as the DELETE type
2018-10-16T13:27:10 <Bosmon> Whilst it is setting-specific, it should really be encoded in the settingsHandler options
2018-10-16T13:27:34 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2018-10-16T13:29:03 <cindyli> Bosmon: i wonder if "path" can be extracted from here when windows processes it - https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L4785-L4790
2018-10-16T13:29:31 <cindyli> meant at processing "highContrastOn" setting
2018-10-16T13:29:40 <Bosmon> cindyli - might be too early
2018-10-16T13:29:47 <Bosmon> Given you want the transform done, etc.
2018-10-16T13:30:11 <Bosmon> I was thinking you could just stick the path in a "pocket" before gpii.lifecycleManager.transformSolutionSettings and then put it back afterwards
2018-10-16T13:30:42 <cindyli> haha, monkey patching
2018-10-16T13:31:36 <cindyli> and it may not be as that easy. before transformation, the block looks like:
2018-10-16T13:31:44 <Bosmon> cindyli - one might call it monkey patching, another might call it "putback-based bidirectional programming" : P - https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/projects/tlcbx/ssbx/Hu+Ko-lecture1.pdf
2018-10-16T13:31:52 <cindyli> "settings": {
2018-10-16T13:31:53 <cindyli> \t"HighContrastOn": {
2018-10-16T13:31:53 <cindyli> \t\t"value": false,
2018-10-16T13:31:53 <cindyli> \t\t"path": "pvParam.dwFlags.HCF_HIGHCONTRASTON"
2018-10-16T13:31:53 <cindyli> }
2018-10-16T13:32:09 <cindyli> after transformation:
2018-10-16T13:32:26 <cindyli> settings: {
2018-10-16T13:32:26 <cindyli> HighContrastOn: false
2018-10-16T13:32:26 <cindyli> }
2018-10-16T13:32:29 <Bosmon> cindyli - yes, it might be easier to hide the putback actually in a modified version of gpii.settingsHandlers.changesToSettings
2018-10-16T13:32:42 <Bosmon> Given it needs to happen within each settings block
2018-10-16T13:34:02 <Bosmon> cindyli - well feel free to do "whatever you need" here by, e.g. writing a special function that just acts for SPI payloads with a big comment on it, if it looks like it is going to be too much of an informational mess
2018-10-16T13:34:40 <cindyli> ok

2018-10-16T15:49:11 <cindyli> sure
2018-10-16T15:49:14 <Bosmon> It is quite little, mostly dependency update and a small tweak to the lifecycleManagerSession events to make it compatible with new Infusion
2018-10-16T15:49:57 <cindyli> ok

2018-10-16T15:52:49 <Bosmon> cindyli/cindyli1 - very good solution, I\'ve just added one comment
2018-10-16T15:53:15 <cindyli1> oh, right, forgot to comment
2018-10-16T15:58:05 * cindyli1 is now known as cindyli
2018-10-16T16:06:42 <cindyli> Bosmon: you suggested to to take a shallow copy of element, is that only when element.path is defined?
2018-10-16T16:06:46 <cindyli> or in general?
2018-10-16T16:07:59 <Bosmon> cindyli - my suggestion was to apply keep fluid.censorKeys(element, "value")
2018-10-16T16:08:10 <Bosmon> If there is no path, or nothing other than value, this will just be an empty object
2018-10-16T16:08:33 <Bosmon> But in any case this makes the general point "Preserve anything other than value" which I imagine is the currently implies settingsHandler contract
2018-10-16T16:13:01 <cindyli> Bosmon: but this function is to preserve the value and wipe out anything else.
2018-10-16T16:13:53 <cindyli> of course, since now "path" needs to be preserved, i agree there might be other things that should be preserved too
2018-10-16T16:14:30 <cindyli> but in any case, the value should certainly be preserved in this function
2018-10-16T16:15:48 <cindyli> and other than "path", we are not clear what else should be preserve. but i believe "type" is the one that should be removed
2018-10-16T16:15:54 * colinclark joined the channel
2018-10-16T16:20:27 <Bosmon> cindyli - I didn\'t realise that "type" could occur in here
2018-10-16T16:21:16 <cindyli> Bosmon: it could because the function starts by checking element.type === "DELETE"
2018-10-16T16:21:33 <Bosmon> cindyli - ah, how awkward
2018-10-16T16:21:45 <Bosmon> OK well, just leave it the way it is then, plus comment : P
2018-10-16T16:21:50 <cindyli> sure
