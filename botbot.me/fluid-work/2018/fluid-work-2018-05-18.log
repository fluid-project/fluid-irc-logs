2018-05-18T11:43:53 <the-t-in-rtf> @Bosmon, I can see that there is coverage data in the gpii-app CI build: https://ci.gpii.net/job/gpii-app-test/235/console

2018-05-18T11:45:28 <the-t-in-rtf> My first thought is that the .nycrc configuration file is somehow not correct, but it\'s right in a clean checkout.
2018-05-18T11:48:06 <the-t-in-rtf> Trying a theory now.
2018-05-18T11:48:20 <the-t-in-rtf> Every run is an hour, so don\'t hold your breath unless you can do so for an hour.

2018-05-18T14:04:33 <cindyli> Bosmon: yesterday, mrtyler merged the ops repo pull requests created for accommodating the universal change on the new data model, and redeployed staging and production prefs server and CBFM. This process includes the rebuild of gpii/gpii-dataloader docker image. can you review my little universal pull request that points to the new dataloader docker image - https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/610

2018-05-18T14:11:33 <the-t-in-rtf> @amatas[m] and others, there is now a CI change for gpii-app blocking a merge: https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-3055
2018-05-18T14:11:58 <the-t-in-rtf> I added it to your backlog, but wanted to point it out, as we wanted to merge this a week ago to assist with ASTEA\'s work.
2018-05-18T14:12:20 <the-t-in-rtf> Is ASTEA an acronym?
2018-05-18T14:12:31 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, not shouting, just thought it was.

2018-05-18T20:33:51 <sgithens> Bosmon stegru: All the core architectural stuff to capture the current machine settings is in universal already right?  I wanted to try it out from a small script or something
2018-05-18T20:34:13 <sgithens> and compare the output to what\'s showing up in these UX mockups
2018-05-18T20:34:35 <sgithens> to thinkout how hard it will be to transform the output

2018-05-18T21:51:12 <Bosmon> sgithens - not really
2018-05-18T21:51:37 <Bosmon> I mean, you could say it is
2018-05-18T21:51:46 <Bosmon> But there\'s a fair bit of plumbing needed to make it actually go
2018-05-18T21:51:52 <sgithens> Bosmon: I thought kasper had written a fair portion of it
2018-05-18T21:52:00 <Bosmon> I was just mentioning to Gregg this week that it would be about time to dust off this ancient PUL of KASPARDNIET\'s: https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/224
2018-05-18T21:52:03 <Bosmon> Yes, he had
2018-05-18T21:52:10 <Bosmon> And it has now sat here these four years :)
2018-05-18T21:52:18 <Bosmon> This will be a pretty hilarious archaeological exercise
2018-05-18T21:52:23 <sgithens> oh wow
2018-05-18T21:52:26 <sgithens> it never got merged
2018-05-18T21:52:33 <Bosmon> Has a conflict with "MatchPost" : P
2018-05-18T21:52:39 <Bosmon> Which has not existed for about 3 years
2018-05-18T21:52:41 <sgithens> hmm
2018-05-18T21:52:43 <sgithens> i see
2018-05-18T21:52:51 <Bosmon> Yes, I think you do :)
2018-05-18T21:53:01 <sgithens> I feel like I may be tasked with this, unless you do it
2018-05-18T21:53:12 <Bosmon> I feel like you will, eys
2018-05-18T21:53:21 <Bosmon> To be honest, it doesn\'t actually look as big a deal as I thought
2018-05-18T21:53:26 <sgithens> awesum
2018-05-18T21:53:28 <Bosmon> "Snapshot.js" is just 50 lines
2018-05-18T21:53:38 <sgithens> yeah, I remember it wasn\'t too crazy
2018-05-18T21:53:45 <Bosmon> And then there\'s a 30 line patch to the LIfecycleManager
2018-05-18T21:53:49 <sgithens> but I thought it had been merged in
2018-05-18T21:54:06 <Bosmon> Well, given it has zero tests, it never was
2018-05-18T21:54:16 <Bosmon> This was the beginning of the period where we started to have SOME standards : P
2018-05-18T21:54:37 <sgithens> Kasper is only available on a sort of occasional ask questions basis right?
2018-05-18T21:54:49 <Bosmon> He could do more substantial work, if we really needed it
2018-05-18T21:54:58 <Bosmon> Gregg has him on a kind of standing contract
2018-05-18T21:55:03 <sgithens> ah
2018-05-18T21:55:05 <Bosmon> But it depends how much time he has available too
2018-05-18T21:55:29 <Bosmon> It took 3 weeks to get hold of him to fix up his Windows pul last month
2018-05-18T21:55:34 <sgithens> I was asking because I\'m going to assign GPII-228 to myself unless you think he would work on it
2018-05-18T21:56:32 <sgithens> I have assigned it!  And luckily everyone in Stuttgart will know since they are watching the ticket
2018-05-18T21:57:00 <Bosmon> hahahahaha
2018-05-18T21:57:01 <Bosmon> Great
2018-05-18T21:57:31 <sgithens> I\'m sure they\'ll be pleased to know the feature hasn\'t gone forgotten
