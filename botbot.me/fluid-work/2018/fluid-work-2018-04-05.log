We prepared some questions about PSP 3 and put them in this document - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sbMC-U21ibRO5jDh55sxQWo3qlqHoHe8mEdCCCbENYE/edit#gid=0, as we would have taken a lot of iRC space for them otherwise. I know that some of them will probably require further discussion, but please let us know your initial thoughts where possible.

2018-04-05T13:41:58 <Justin_o> grrrero: hello, how are you doing today? Have you had a chance to look at https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5525 and if so, how are things going?
2018-04-05T13:43:08 <grrrero> Hi Justin_o , started looking at what different parts reference Comic Sans
2018-04-05T13:43:18 <grrrero> Oh wow the font changed
2018-04-05T13:43:38 <Justin_o> haha, yah that\'s amazing actually
2018-04-05T13:43:43 <grrrero> Is OpenDyslexic available on every platform?
2018-04-05T13:43:44 <Justin_o> i didn\'t know it would do that
2018-04-05T13:43:48 <grrrero> Ya hahaa
2018-04-05T13:44:27 <Justin_o> grrrero: not by default at least. We\'ll have to provide a copy of the font
2018-04-05T13:44:47 <grrrero> I see
2018-04-05T13:45:23 * danailbd_ joined the channel
2018-04-05T13:47:39 <grrrero> Justin_o: did we still want to keep Comic Sans ?
2018-04-05T13:55:15 <Justin_o> grrrero: hmm.. i\'m not 100% sure. I believe comic sans is used for those who have trouble reading more typical typefaces. https://www.thecut.com/2017/03/the-reason-comic-sans-is-a-public-good.html
2018-04-05T13:55:18 * kasparnet has quit
2018-04-05T13:57:13 <Justin_o> OpenDyslexic should help with that too though, and has been specifically design to help those with dyslexia. I suppose that could be a potential barrier in that someone may want an easier to read font, but may not identify as having dyslexia.
2018-04-05T13:57:53 <Justin_o> i think it\'s always nice to have choice, but the other issue is that while comic sans is widely available, it may not be on all platforms. For example, I don\'t believe iOS natively supports it
2018-04-05T14:04:30 <Justin_o> grrrero: here\'s an interesting article about Apple\'s San Francisco Font https://www.dailydot.com/via/iso-9-san-francisco-font/
2018-04-05T14:13:25 <Justin_o> sadly it doesn\'t look like the license for san francisco will allow us to add it to UIO. Anyways, if we keep comic sans we may either want to have some fall back in the CSS to another supported font, or to remove it as an option on platforms that don\'t support it

2018-04-05T14:41:59 <cindyli> Bosmon, colinclark, sgithens, simonjb, do you think if it\'s possible to meet this week to talk about the next step for these APIs before Bosmon disappears last week:
2018-04-05T14:42:00 <cindyli> https://wiki.gpii.net/w/Capture_Tool_APIs

2018-04-05T14:42:24 <cindyli> this will also be what i should work on next
2018-04-05T14:42:46 <simonjb> cindyli: yes, I can meet
2018-04-05T14:43:20 <simonjb> I\'m free today after 3 eastern or any time tomorrow
2018-04-05T14:43:35 <cindyli> thanks, simonjb. my schedule is same as simonjb\'s
2018-04-05T14:44:53 <colinclark> I\'m booked for most of today and until 2 pm tomorrow
2018-04-05T14:44:59 <colinclark> do you want to try for 2 pm EDT?
2018-04-05T14:45:26 <colinclark> That may not work well for Bosmon\'s schedule

2018-04-05T16:16:51 <simonjb> cindyli, sgithens: don\'t want to be too pedantic but 2pm EDT, right? (in case anyone uses an automatic timezone calculator)
2018-04-05T16:18:18 <Justin_o> gtirloni: if i\'m making a command line interface and it takes in a list of files, would you expect that to be a space separated list or comma separated, or something else?
2018-04-05T16:18:53 <gtirloni> is processing those files the CLI\'s main objective?
2018-04-05T16:21:16 <Justin_o> gtirloni: not really.. just looking over this PR https://github.com/fluid-project/fluid-publish/pull/10/files
2018-04-05T16:21:38 <cindyli> simonjb: right, EDT, my mistake :)
2018-04-05T16:21:39 <Justin_o> there\'s a filesToClean option that takes a list of files that should be reverted if they are tracked by version control
2018-04-05T16:21:43 <Justin_o> gtirloni: ^
2018-04-05T16:22:07 <gtirloni> i\'m asking because if it is, IMHO, "command [OPTION]... [FILE]..." would be recommended. If it\'s not and you only need these files for some specific thing (and so it\'s under an option), then "CMD --option file1,file2,..,fileN" would be my preference (command separated)
2018-04-05T16:22:31 <gtirloni> but i see the files are the intent of the \'git checkout\' operation, right? i think it makes sense for them to be space separated at the end of the command line
2018-04-05T16:24:26 <Justin_o> gtirloni: i believe you would have to run something like "fluid-publish --filesToClean="file 1 file2"
2018-04-05T16:24:40 <Justin_o> i could be remember that incorrectly but i think that\'s how it works
2018-04-05T16:24:46 <gtirloni> oh i see.. i\'d vote for commad-separated in that case
2018-04-05T16:24:53 <gtirloni> *comma
2018-04-05T16:25:18 <gtirloni> if that was: "fluid-publish clean <files>", then space separated
2018-04-05T16:25:41 <Justin_o> looking at the README it looks like what i mentioned above https://github.com/fluid-project/fluid-publish#options
2018-04-05T16:25:58 <Justin_o> i guess without the -- though
2018-04-05T16:26:37 <Justin_o> perhaps that\'s a problem with the api.. maybe it should have the -- in front... i wonder
2018-04-05T16:27:46 <gtirloni> i think \'--\' means \'from here on, nothing is an option that i\'ll use personally\' (so you\'re free to pass \'--\' in some string somewhere and it won\'t get interpreted as an option to the command you just ran
2018-04-05T16:28:54 <Justin_o> okay
2018-04-05T16:29:00 <Justin_o> so maybe it\'s fine then
2018-04-05T16:30:10 * simonjb has quit
2018-04-05T16:30:19 <gtirloni> for instance: https://www.pastery.net/kavmgm/ (first grep will hang, it thinks it got "command" + "some option" + "a pattern".. without a file, so it\'s filtering stdin)
2018-04-05T16:32:35 <gtirloni> the only problem i see with  --filesToClean="file 1 file2"  is someone forgetting the quotes, then file2 gets passed as a separate option? maybe it\'s specific to the parsing library
2018-04-05T16:32:46 <clown> jhernandez:  Room 3 for the windows meeting?
2018-04-05T16:33:39 <clown> GotoMeetings says:  "The meeting will begin when Eugene Yang arrives"
2018-04-05T16:33:43 <Justin_o> gtirloni: fluid-publish uses https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/process.html#process_process_argv
2018-04-05T16:34:37 <Justin_o> gtirloni: also it would currently look like fluid-publish filesToClean="file 1 file2"
2018-04-05T16:34:59 <Justin_o> the --filesToClean was a mistake, it looks like it\'s setup to take the key/value pair directly
2018-04-05T16:35:48 <jhernandez> clown: I\'m on it
2018-04-05T16:35:59 <jhernandez> already there
2018-04-05T16:39:51 <gtirloni> Justin_o: got it, makes sense. i think separating by comma would make it harder to mistype something but depends on the audience too. i\'ve seen many CLI UX guidelines but it\'s hard to have consensus :)
2018-04-05T16:40:34 <Justin_o> gtirloni: thanks for the help
2018-04-05T16:40:40 <gtirloni> yw
2018-04-05T16:42:04 <sgithens> simonjb 2pm Eastern Friday would be great for me cindyli
