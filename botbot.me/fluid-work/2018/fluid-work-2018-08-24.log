2018-08-24T11:09:28 <Justin_o> Bosmon: I wonder if CI also runs a build on it\'s own?
2018-08-24T11:09:43 <Bosmon> Justin_o - what do you mean?
2018-08-24T11:12:00 <Justin_o> sorry, replying to your comment from yesterday "Which then raises the issue, why does gtirloni\'s pull appear to pass CI?"
2018-08-24T11:12:34 <Justin_o> I wonder if there is a step in spinning up the tests on CI that also triggers a build a head of time
2018-08-24T11:12:36 <Bosmon> Justin_o - that\'s fine, gtirloni and I resolved the issue overnight
2018-08-24T11:12:39 <Bosmon> His pull is merged now
2018-08-24T11:12:53 <Justin_o> oh cool, what was it?

2018-08-24T11:16:02 <Bosmon> The CI instructions for the vagrant box explicitly invoked "grunt"
2018-08-24T11:16:54 <Justin_o> Bosmon: ah okay.. so it was running a build as part of the CI

2018-08-24T19:07:06 <sgithens> Bosmon cindyli: Do any of our couch datasources have couch\'s standard paging/range operators baked in yet?
2018-08-24T19:07:48 <sgithens> or, is there any sort of datasource mixin grade yet that specifies that those type of fetch options?
2018-08-24T19:15:49 <cindyli> sgithens: do you mean the use of "startkey"/"endkey" when retrieving by a view, or, a limit of number of records? or both?
2018-08-24T19:15:57 <cindyli> as far as i know, no
2018-08-24T19:16:04 <cindyli> if you meant above
2018-08-24T19:17:08 <sgithens> cindyli: yes
2018-08-24T19:17:15 <sgithens> cool
2018-08-24T19:17:37 <sgithens> right now on the front page of the PPT, it just dumps the entire set of prefs safes
2018-08-24T19:17:44 <sgithens> which we might not want in the future :)
2018-08-24T19:17:49 <cindyli> ya
2018-08-24T19:17:55 <sgithens> oddly though, it doesn\'t always return all of them
2018-08-24T19:18:09 <sgithens> sometimes on refresh it only returns a partial list
2018-08-24T19:18:21 <cindyli> oh, weird
2018-08-24T19:18:23 <sgithens> I have\'t figured out which handler or datasource the issue is happening at yet
2018-08-24T19:18:27 <sgithens> it is pretty wierd
2018-08-24T19:18:34 <sgithens> and random
2018-08-24T19:18:54 <sgithens> you can just sit there and keep reloading the page and sometimes they all show up and sometimes it\'s just like half of them
2018-08-24T19:19:07 <cindyli> timeout with large amount of data? just guessing
2018-08-24T19:19:32 <sgithens> maybe... it must be short though because we don\'t have that many prefssafes
2018-08-24T19:19:39 <sgithens> it\'s like 40 rows or something
2018-08-24T19:19:48 <cindyli> right

2018-08-24T20:35:42 <sgithens> cindyli : The Gpii-app/QSS install from the audit demo is writing to *.prd.gpii.net right?
2018-08-24T20:39:52 <cindyli> sgithens: no, it writes to javi\'s personal cloud
2018-08-24T20:40:00 <cindyli> finding the url...
2018-08-24T20:40:25 <sgithens> I jsut got it :)
2018-08-24T20:40:28 <cindyli> cool
2018-08-24T20:40:41 <sgithens> I just starting goes through all the nodes fromthe amazon console :p
2018-08-24T20:40:50 <sgithens> s/starting/started/
2018-08-24T20:41:03 <cindyli> haha, great you have the console open
2018-08-24T20:41:17 <cindyli> i rarely hop onto it ;)
2018-08-24T20:41:19 <sgithens> cindyli: I still can barely find anything in it, but it\'s sort of helpful
2018-08-24T20:41:25 <sgithens> I should spend a bit more time learning how to use
2018-08-24T20:41:25 <sgithens> it
2018-08-24T20:41:36 <cindyli> certainly. me too
2018-08-24T20:41:40 <sgithens> there\'s just... so many pages in the menu of it
