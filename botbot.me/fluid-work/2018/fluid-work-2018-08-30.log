2018-08-30T11:34:12 <Justin_o> Bosmon: Hello, i have a couple of PRs for the Infusion Dependencies. This PR updates the grunt-modulefiles ( https://github.com/fluid-project/grunt-modulefiles/pull/7 ) and this one updates Infusion ( https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/929 ). Note that we\'ll need to cut a new stable release of grunt-modulefiles and update the Infusion pull but for now it is using a dev release.

2018-08-30T12:52:15 <Justin_o> However, for the docs that top level heading is injected.

2018-08-30T13:40:53 <the-t-in-rtf> there is absolutely a way to disable that specific check, and that\'s used in infusion-docs
2018-08-30T13:41:07 <the-t-in-rtf> just look at that repo for an example.

2018-08-30T15:22:42 <simonjb> hi michelled, thanks for your note on the image text transcripts, I\'m wondering what the best way to manage that is
2018-08-30T15:22:51 <simonjb> there\'s a lot of text
2018-08-30T15:23:03 <simonjb> maybe put into a separate web page and link to?
2018-08-30T15:23:39 <simonjb> if we add to the existing page, it might overwhelm the page content
2018-08-30T15:24:04 <simonjb> at least for the last one, though maybe not
2018-08-30T15:24:32 <simonjb> I\'ll start by writing up the text

2018-08-30T15:54:14 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: thanks.. yah i saw it changed in infusion-docs.. i\'m updating it to use gpii-grunt-lint-all now.. and wondering how to pass the config options
2018-08-30T15:59:59 * michelled has quit
2018-08-30T16:04:22 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: so i\'m looking at https://github.com/GPII/gpii-grunt-lint-all/blob/master/tasks/lint-all.js and I\'m guessing what I need to do is to add in a markdownlint task and just provide the options I want to add/override. I was expecting that I\'d be configuring this through the lintAll task directly.
2018-08-30T16:10:07 <the-t-in-rtf> @Justin_o, you can just add a markdownlint options block and configure its options as you would with the regular plugin.
2018-08-30T16:10:50 <the-t-in-rtf> the lintAll task uses the normal named configurations for everything else, so you can opt out of stuff without needing any specific support in gpii-grunt-lint-all
2018-08-30T16:11:11 <the-t-in-rtf> It\'s only the "src" parameter that\'s munged a bit.
2018-08-30T16:11:29 <the-t-in-rtf> It\'s a good point, I\'ll be changing things around a bit soon and will have to test support for options passing.
2018-08-30T16:14:15 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: thanks.. i got the header check to override, but am having trouble getting the line-length setting to change.. i want to put it to false like you had it, but it\'s still using 120 character.
2018-08-30T16:14:25 <Justin_o> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/CwEQzP2G/
2018-08-30T16:15:21 <Justin_o> this is also the case if i just set line-length to false.
2018-08-30T16:17:03 <the-t-in-rtf> Already off for the day, if you can\'t puzzle it out, commit or send me a pastie via email or DM and I\'ll look into it in the morning.
2018-08-30T16:17:22 <the-t-in-rtf> It should definitely be possible, if I find anything that interferes with merging options I\'ll definitely fix it.

2018-08-30T16:32:55 * alanharnum has quit
2018-08-30T16:33:15 <the-t-in-rtf> It may be down to not defining a proper multitask setup.
2018-08-30T16:33:30 <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. I\'m not 100% sure that you can use config with the way we\'re using markdownlint
2018-08-30T16:33:42 <the-t-in-rtf> we might need to define a task like "default"
2018-08-30T16:33:47 <the-t-in-rtf> I mean a sub-task
2018-08-30T16:34:35 <the-t-in-rtf> hmm, that doesn\'t seem to be it, we use similar syntax: https://github.com/GPII/gpii-grunt-lint-all/blob/master/tasks/lint-all.js#L68
2018-08-30T16:35:02 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, especially if you have a branch in progress, shoot me a link if you still need help at the end of the day.
2018-08-30T16:36:24 <the-t-in-rtf> One last though, what happens if you load gpii-grunt-lint-all before init-ing the config.
2018-08-30T16:36:29 <the-t-in-rtf> also, latest version?
2018-08-30T16:36:39 <the-t-in-rtf> I had some odd setups for merging early on.
2018-08-30T16:37:33 <Justin_o> thanks, i\'ll try those suggestions.. I\'m using the latest stable 1.0.4
2018-08-30T16:38:56 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: when i load gpii-grunt-ling-all before initing the config, I get \'No "eslint" targets found.\'
2018-08-30T16:39:18 <Justin_o> and then it fails and quits
2018-08-30T16:39:23 <the-t-in-rtf> yeah, don\'t do that then.
2018-08-30T16:39:29 <Justin_o> :)
2018-08-30T16:41:42 * alanharnum joined the channel
2018-08-30T16:41:57 <Justin_o> So it seems like i can add config options, for example the ones for the first header, but i can\'t override the ones that are set in gpii-grunt-lint-all.. i\'ll keep poking around though
