2018-06-25T12:27:41 <the-t-in-rtf> universal builds are failing with VM provisioning errors:
2018-06-25T12:27:41 <the-t-in-rtf> https://ci.gpii.net/job/universal-create-vm/438/console
2018-06-25T12:27:59 <the-t-in-rtf> Does someone need to kick Jenkins or something similar?
2018-06-25T12:28:37 <the-t-in-rtf> The previous build failed with the usual NPE nonsense:
2018-06-25T12:28:38 <the-t-in-rtf> https://ci.gpii.net/job/universal-tests/917/console
2018-06-25T12:33:12 <gtirloni> looks like fedora\'s webservice that gives the repo list to the package manager had some issues (503)
2018-06-25T12:33:18 <gtirloni> i\'d just try again
2018-06-25T12:33:49 <gtirloni> i\'m not getting a 503 here right now

2018-06-25T12:59:58 <the-t-in-rtf> Thanks for retriggering.
2018-06-25T13:00:28 <the-t-in-rtf> That one should definitely pass, I only actually changed the way the linting runs and not any real code.
2018-06-25T13:00:31 <the-t-in-rtf> it\'s a very simple change.

2018-06-25T13:41:46 <the-t-in-rtf> @gtirloni or anyone with admin access to ci.gpii.net, what version of the MultiJob Plugin are we using?
2018-06-25T13:41:47 <the-t-in-rtf> https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Multijob+Plugin
2018-06-25T13:42:15 <the-t-in-rtf> In a side conversation today with an external colleague it came up, and I see that they claim to have better options for stopping a series of jobs when one fails.

2018-06-25T14:52:39 <Bosmon> stegru - fwiw I found the GPII-2772 test passed even with the right reference
2018-06-25T14:52:55 <Bosmon> But I guess your new functionality isn\'t actually exercising anything in core
2018-06-25T14:53:09 <Bosmon> Given that we can\'t actually activate this setting in VM, right?
2018-06-25T14:53:42 <stegru> yes that\'s right, Bosmon
2018-06-25T14:54:01 <Bosmon> So I guess the setting is just a no-op in the VM?
2018-06-25T14:54:17 * danayo joined the channel
2018-06-25T14:55:43 <stegru> yes Bosmon, in fact the universal PR is not needed for the settingsHandler
2018-06-25T14:55:56 <Bosmon> ok
2018-06-25T14:56:02 <stegru> it\'s only there to provide a setting that makes use of the handler
2018-06-25T14:56:10 <Bosmon> I guess we may as well at least check that they don\'t conflict : P

2018-06-25T17:06:31 <cindyli> the-t-in-rtf: fine with me
2018-06-25T17:07:43 <the-t-in-rtf> thanks, Cindy.
2018-06-25T17:11:30 <sgithens> the-t-in-rtf that\'s fine

2018-06-25T17:11:51 <Bosmon> ok
2018-06-25T17:12:04 <the-t-in-rtf> Is that your "ok, yes", or "ok, I hear you"?

2018-06-25T17:12:51 <Bosmon> It would be churlish to say "ok" whilst disagreeing with the point in question : P
2018-06-25T17:18:34 <sgithens> churlish!

2018-06-25T17:49:35 <gtirloni> the-t-in-rtf: gpii\'s multijob plugin is 1.28 ... i think that plugin was up for adoption last year for several months. for jenkins, it seems the pipeline DSL is the natural successor of that
