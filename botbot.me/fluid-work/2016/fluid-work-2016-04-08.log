b'2016-04-08T14:53:14 <cindyli> let me do a search first to find out configs for lifecycleManager
2016-04-08T14:54:06 * the-t-in-rtf has quit
2016-04-08T14:56:07 <cindyli> Katy_: you were right, lifecycleManager is defined in gpii/configs/fm.ps.sr.dr.mm.os.lms.multipleMatchMakers.json and gpii/configs/fm.ps.sr.dr.mm.os.lms.production.json
2016-04-08T14:56:21 * the-t-in-rtf joined the channel
2016-04-08T14:57:10 <cindyli> these files indicate lifecycleManager is OS sensitive.
2016-04-08T14:57:40 <Katy_> cindyli. I see
2016-04-08T14:59:41 <cindyli> Katy_: lifecycleManager is accessible even GPII is started in dev mode
2016-04-08T15:00:57 * kasparnet joined the channel
2016-04-08T15:01:30 <cindyli> if you have a look on FlowManager.js, line 59, that\'s where lifecycleManager is attached onto the flowManager.
2016-04-08T15:02:31 <Katy_> cindyli  Yes, that makes sense.
2016-04-08T15:02:34 <cindyli> those 2 config files can kick in when GPII is running in production on certain OS to perform more specific configurations.

2016-04-08T15:09:33 <simonjb> hey colinclark, I have reduced the frequency of sensor updates but I\'m still having audio issues like we heard yesterday
2016-04-08T15:10:02 <simonjb> it sounds like maybe the change in tremolo frequency is causing the sample to trigger
2016-04-08T15:10:18 * the-t-in-rtf has quit
2016-04-08T15:10:28 <simonjb> I reduced to max 10 updates per second

2016-04-08T15:56:52 <Katy_> simonjb The other day you mentioned there are good reasons why gpii will not implement social login such as facebook and twitter. I know I\'m a little reluctant going to site that indicates I can login using my facebook id. I was trying to recall and cannot quite remember the gpii reasons.  Can you tell me why again the reasons again for gpii.
2016-04-08T16:00:08 * the-t-in-rtf has quit
2016-04-08T16:01:05 <simonjb> Katy_: I think the main reason is privacy and sensitivity of information -- wanting to keep it separate from any connection to a social site
2016-04-08T16:01:37 <Katy_> Thank you simonjb
2016-04-08T16:01:47 <PaliwalSparsh> Justin_o: I tried doing what you told I removed the that.previous.children("a").attr(...) and put that.previous.attr(...) but as a result of this when I use the keyboard to put focus on the disabled link, screen reader says "internal link disabled", but when i click with mouse on the disabled link it focuses on the link inside and says "internal link" only. Though I have pushed accordingly to what you said.

2016-04-08T16:25:10 <akshay_> Justin_o: My midsem exams ended today and I have started with the architecture diagram and use case design part. I was trying to make a demo and came across
2016-04-08T16:25:15 <akshay_> few questions.
2016-04-08T16:26:57 <akshay_> like in the Preference framework the first preference that user encounters is the language selection and he should be knowing how to use a mouse
2016-04-08T16:27:18 <akshay_> or use the tab button if he prefers to use a keyboard.
2016-04-08T16:28:45 <akshay_> but in the game we want to make users who might not have any knowledge of working with the keyboard or mouse accustomed to it. So how to do with the language slection part in the case.
2016-04-08T16:29:02 <akshay_> as we are assuming that the user might have knowledge of using a mouse or a keyboard.
2016-04-08T16:30:34 <akshay_> moreover the input preference checkpoint is suppose to come after the language selection checkpoint but the user is already done with it during the language selection checkpoint.
2016-04-08T16:32:29 <akshay_> I was talking about the first discovery tool.

2016-04-08T17:48:07 <Katy_> simonjb cindyli  I installed vagrant using the virtual box.  I was able to run a sammy login on my virtual box web browser.   I used these instruction https://github.com/gpii/windows#test-vm.  Which pointed to  Windows 10 Evaulation.  Which looks like it is only good for a month.   Is there a Windows license that last more than 1 month?
2016-04-08T17:48:47 <cindyli> avtar, ^
2016-04-08T17:50:23 <avtar> cindyli, Katy_: another vm will be uploaded and available as an upgrade closer to the license expiration date
2016-04-08T17:50:33 <avtar> the new vm will be valid for another 90 days

2016-04-08T18:06:38 <Katy_> avtar. thanks.  For some reason I see an expiration of 30 days and not 90 days.  I probably downloaded the wrong windows 10 versions. I\'ll look at the instruction site again.
2016-04-08T18:07:23 <avtar> Katy_: no need, you have the right vm :) it was uploaded 60 days ago

2016-04-08T18:22:34 <alanharnum> jhung: that\'s perfect - if it\'s something structural about the markup that makes it impossible to reposition let me know & I\'ll poke at it myself
2016-04-08T18:24:03 <jhung> alanharnum: it is, but I have a compromise which I\'m working with right now. Do you want to see it?
2016-04-08T18:24:28 <alanharnum> i think a compromise is fine for our purposes

2016-04-08T20:31:24 <jhung> I tried styling the select box to make the drop-down triangle to look like the mock-up, but I couldn\'t get it to look right across all browsers alanharnum. So I left it at its default.

2016-04-08T13:09:21 <Katy_> cindyli Bosmon   GPII is using the node module oauth2orize that deal with the authorization.  Regarding Antranig\'s "Criteria for Evaluating User Management Libraries" Wiki, The user management libraries tool is to handle user functions such as creating  and managing the userid/password.   And not authorization features such as generation  of tokens (since oauth2orize is the technology chosen for that purpose)
2016-04-08T13:10:32 <Katy_> Antranig are you Bosmon or Bosmon7
2016-04-08T13:13:04 <cindyli> Katy_: i agree that the basic functionalities of a user management system is to manage user accounts. However, with GPII, we do need to think about how the user management can work with OAuth integration
2016-04-08T13:13:54 <cindyli> Katy_: Bosmon mentioned in the last meeting that he will be travelling on Friday. I\'m not sure if he\'s online right now
2016-04-08T13:15:24 <cindyli> i know Bosmon usually has multiple devices connecting to irc. seeing him online sometimes doesn\'t mean he\'s paying attention to irc :)
2016-04-08T13:16:04 <cindyli> btw, Katy_, yes, Bosmon/Bosmon7 is Antranig
2016-04-08T13:17:52 <wale> still on the same topic
2016-04-08T13:18:02 <wale> cindyli any thoughts given to JWT\'s
2016-04-08T13:18:03 <wale> ?
2016-04-08T13:18:26 <wale> perhaps a question for Antranig
2016-04-08T13:18:44 <Katy_> cindlyli thank you.
2016-04-08T13:19:04 <wale> looking at an approach that uses an API Proxy gateway
2016-04-08T13:19:16 <cindyli> wale: JWT? json web sockets?
2016-04-08T13:19:21 <cindyli> no problem, Katy_
2016-04-08T13:19:48 <wale> yes cindlyli

2016-04-08T13:21:24 <cindyli> wale: honestly i don\'t have thoughts on that, wale ;) i can start thinking about that tho

2016-04-08T14:22:10 <cindyli> Katy_: "flowManager" is the name of a component that\'s on the same component tree. in terms of the component tree, let me see if i can find some docs
2016-04-08T14:22:42 <cindyli> Katy_: http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/UnderstandingInfusionComponents.html
2016-04-08T14:23:58 <cindyli> As it says: Every Infusion application is structured as a set of components.
2016-04-08T14:24:07 <cindyli> also at http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/Contexts.html
2016-04-08T14:24:20 <cindyli> All Infusion components are stored in a single-rooted component tree
2016-04-08T14:25:19 <cindyli> the components are visible to each other within certain contexts. the way you refer to another component is to use that component\'s name
2016-04-08T14:26:35 <cindyli> there\'s a diagram in the second link that explains the component visibility rules - http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/Contexts.html#where-context-names-are-looked-for
2016-04-08T14:30:22 <Katy_> cindyli  I will read those links. Can you give me the names of the gpii files that defines the single-rooted component trees.
2016-04-08T14:31:08 <cindyli> sure, Katy_, another link u might be interested - http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/IoCReferences.html#examples-of-lt-componentref-gt-
2016-04-08T14:31:28 <cindyli> this explains ways that a component can be referenced
2016-04-08T14:34:52 <Katy_> thank you cindyli
2016-04-08T14:35:32 <cindyli> Katy_: the single-rooted gpii component is constructed via configurations
2016-04-08T14:35:58 <cindyli> you can find all the configurations at https://github.com/GPII/universal/tree/master/gpii/configs
2016-04-08T14:36:36 <cindyli> you probably have seen in the last meeting when we start GPII, a configuration file needs to be specified in the command
2016-04-08T14:37:41 <Katy_> cindyli  yes. I saw how you had a configuration file.
2016-04-08T14:39:09 <cindyli> let\'s walk thru one example, Katy_. To construct a hybrid GPII instance with hybrid configuration in a dev env, the configuration file "https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/configs/untrusted.development.all.local.json" is used - https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/configs/untrusted.development.all.local.json
2016-04-08T14:40:00 <Katy_> cindyli. let\'s walk through.   I will open those two files.
2016-04-08T14:40:03 <cindyli> if you open this file, the config block at line 6 constructs a local server
2016-04-08T14:40:19 <cindyli> sorry, Katy_, those 2 links point to the same file
2016-04-08T14:40:49 <cindyli> i didn\'t realize the first copy actually copied the link instead of the file name :)
2016-04-08T14:41:19 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2016-04-08T14:41:19 <cindyli> the config block at line 10 constructs the cloud server
2016-04-08T14:42:33 * the-t-in-rtf joined the channel
2016-04-08T14:42:34 <cindyli> let\'s look at the local config first: line 7 says to use another config file "untrusted.development" to construct the instance for the local server
2016-04-08T14:42:47 <Katy_> cindyli.  k. still following
2016-04-08T14:42:53 <cindyli> if we open that file at https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/configs/untrusted.development.json
2016-04-08T14:44:03 <cindyli> at line 7 in this file, a kettle server component is constructed by using other 2 configuration files specified in "includes" block at line 15
2016-04-08T14:44:37 <cindyli> if you are interested, you can dig down to look at those 2 files.
2016-04-08T14:44:55 <Katy_> cindyli  yes. I will look at those two other files
2016-04-08T14:46:37 <cindyli> Katy_: you should be able to see in the first included config file https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/deviceReporter/configs/development.json
2016-04-08T14:47:13 <cindyli> the device reporter is presented
2016-04-08T14:48:10 <Katy_> cindyli that makes sense.
2016-04-08T14:48:23 <cindyli> the walk-thru of this chain is to give you an idea of how GPII can be flexibly assembled
2016-04-08T14:50:21 <Katy_> cindyli So for this {flowManager}.lifecycleManager parameters.  I see two config files for lifecycleManager.
2016-04-08T14:51:01 <cindyli> ok
2016-04-08T14:51:13 <cindyli> your question is?
2016-04-08T14:52:10 <cindyli> at gpii/configs folder, you can see other configuration files that are for different cases, such as starting the cloud server only
2016-04-08T14:52:17 <Katy_> cindyli. Can we go through the chain in how that is defined.  {flowManager}.lifecycleManager
2016-04-08T14:52:43 <cindyli> sure
