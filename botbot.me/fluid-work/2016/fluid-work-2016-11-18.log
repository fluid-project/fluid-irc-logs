2016-11-18T16:16:03 <the-t-in-rtf> so, dump the upward resolution in everything but fluid itself and use fluid.require("%gpii-express")
2016-11-18T16:16:07 <Bosmon> Ah sorry I have now read up
2016-11-18T16:16:15 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - yes, that would work too
2016-11-18T16:16:46 <Bosmon> I can\'t actually remember why you required to dedupe yourself

2016-11-18T16:17:19 <the-t-in-rtf> probably sheer laziness, wanting for everything below the current package to use the latest git hash
2016-11-18T16:18:39 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, @cindyli, if you assign the ticket to me and paste the link, I will put it on my schedule for Monday morning.
2016-11-18T16:18:46 <the-t-in-rtf> which means it should be ready before you start work.
2016-11-18T16:19:01 <cindyli> thanks a lot, the-t-in-rtf
2016-11-18T16:19:30 <the-t-in-rtf> Sorry I can\'t do it today, I don\'t quite have enough time before I leave for the day.
2016-11-18T16:19:51 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, hope it\'s not blocking too much other work.

2016-11-18T16:33:13 <cindyli> not a problem, the-t-in-rtf, created the jira - https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2149 and assigned to you. have a good weekend.

2016-11-18T16:49:09 <alanharnum_lab> Justin_o: ^ question above about Chrome + JAWS crashing... did we have that conversation or am I imagining it? :)
2016-11-18T16:49:19 <alanharnum_lab> (both scenarios are likely)

2016-11-18T16:54:46 <cindyli> yes, alanharnum_lab, i rmb that conversation too. JAWS crashes chrome
2016-11-18T16:55:03 <alanharnum_lab> cindyli: thanks!
2016-11-18T16:56:19 <alanharnum_lab> cindyli Justin_o: I\'ve done some screenreader testing on Windows (https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/787#issuecomment-261561414) - I\'m breaking for lunch soon but can do more comprehensive or other browser/AT combinations if needed

2016-11-18T21:33:41 * alanharn_ has quit
2016-11-18T21:35:30 <cindyli1> alanharnum: when i use voiceover to test the pager, when the focus is on a page link, i found the page number is not announced. what gets announced is the starting and ending names in the drop down div
2016-11-18T21:35:51 <cindyli1> is it same with other screen readers?
2016-11-18T21:37:38 * alanharnum joined the channel

2016-11-18T22:37:26 <colinclark> awesome, thank you
2016-11-18T22:37:47 <simonjb> the modified Flocking isn\'t required as the public API hasn\'t changed
2016-11-18T22:37:58 <simonjb> it just will no longer crash on ALSA
2016-11-18T22:39:26 <simonjb> colinclark: and the Flocking monitor works on the chip

2016-11-18T14:24:05 <alanharnum> Justin_o: for the Uploader testing you want cindyli & myself to do this morning, is it basically to verify that screen readers continue to perform well in the Uploader and Pager with role=application removed?
2016-11-18T14:24:36 <Justin_o> alanharnum: yes, i have a branch for it... i\'ll file a PR. I still need to get an updated CLA though before it can be merged
2016-11-18T14:24:50 <alanharnum> Justin_o: ah, ok, so we\'re waiting on the CLA
2016-11-18T14:25:10 <Justin_o> alanharnum: yes, but i can get the PR up so that you can start testing it
2016-11-18T14:25:15 <alanharnum> ok
2016-11-18T14:25:22 <alanharnum> thanks, let me know when it\'s up
2016-11-18T14:25:51 <alanharnum> if cindyli is working from home maybe she can do the Mac-based testing and I\'ll do Windows here in the lab?
2016-11-18T14:26:21 <cindyli> sounds good, alanharnum
2016-11-18T14:28:00 <Justin_o> alanharnum, cindyli: here\'s the PR https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/787
2016-11-18T14:28:12 <Justin_o> I\'ve marked it as review only for now, but will update when i get the updated CLA.

2016-11-18T14:49:51 <gtirloni> fluid-everyone: hi! I need to apply some security updates to Fluid\'s JIRA and Confluence... would it be okay to do it now? anyone actively working on them?
2016-11-18T14:52:36 <gtirloni> i don\'t see open connections to the server so I\'ll proceed :)
2016-11-18T15:02:44 <alanharnum_lab> Justin_o: One thing I did notice testing the Uploader with Narrator - if you try and upload files that are too large, there\'s no notification to the screen reader of the error message
2016-11-18T15:03:01 <Justin_o> alanharnum_lab: did you get that before?
2016-11-18T15:03:14 <alanharnum_lab> it doesn\'t look like the warning log has any aria attributes that would cause this to happen - is this something that should be noted?
2016-11-18T15:03:20 <alanharnum_lab> no, just noting it
2016-11-18T15:03:52 <Justin_o> alanharnum_lab: yes, should make a JIRA for that
2016-11-18T15:06:19 <alanharnum_lab> Justin_o: OK, will do so
2016-11-18T15:06:23 <alanharnum_lab> as an improvement
2016-11-18T15:08:08 <Justin_o> alanharnum_lab: hmm... or a bug, not sure in this case actually
2016-11-18T15:08:21 <alanharnum_lab> it could be a bug yeah,
2016-11-18T15:08:31 <alanharnum_lab> it is probably an oversight in the component behaviour
2016-11-18T15:08:56 <alanharnum_lab> a "red"-type error message visually should result in an equivalent screen reader notification
2016-11-18T15:09:02 <alanharnum_lab> in current state an AT user doesn\'t know something has gone wrong
2016-11-18T15:10:02 <Justin_o> alanharnum_lab: yes, exactly, should be an alert or status or something

2016-11-18T15:18:32 <Justin_o> if you really need to use those features, worst case scenario you can use multiple version of jquery in the same page

2016-11-18T15:45:46 <Justin_o> cindyli: about the namespace for the listeners?
2016-11-18T15:45:52 <cindyli> yes
2016-11-18T15:45:57 <Justin_o> cindyli: if that\'s it, i\'m working on that one right now, just running the tests
2016-11-18T15:46:40 <cindyli> cool. yes, that\'s the only one so far, will do linting and testing once that\'s in
2016-11-18T15:48:01 <cindyli> Bosmon, Bosmon5, the-t-in-rtf, the acceptance test failure, https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/464#issuecomment-260697766, that Bosmon found using gpii/windows platform with my ouchdb pull request is caused by this version of gpii-express index.js - https://github.com/the-t-in-rtf/gpii-express/blob/bf17c0517d10902f61aa2ba491f29eaef49cf1be/index.js#L27
2016-11-18T15:48:03 <Justin_o> gtirloni: i can\'t access the fluid wiki
2016-11-18T15:48:27 <Justin_o> cindyli: the PR is updated with the namespace chagnes
2016-11-18T15:48:28 <Justin_o> changes
2016-11-18T15:48:39 <cindyli> thanks, Justin_o, will have a look soon
2016-11-18T15:48:59 <cindyli> at this line, gpii-express looks 3 levels up in the directory structure to find "parentExpress"
2016-11-18T15:49:23 <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks, i\'m going to drop offline now.. if you need me, please send me an e-mail.
2016-11-18T15:49:31 <cindyli> sure, Justin_o
2016-11-18T15:50:27 <cindyli> Bosmon, the-t-in-rtf, in the way that the windows vagrat is set up, 2 levels up will already ends up into the vagrant shared folder root dir, where is also the location that the node_modules/ folder sits
2016-11-18T15:50:50 <cindyli> so, gpii-express will find itself as the "parentExpress"
2016-11-18T15:52:48 <the-t-in-rtf> Is infusion a dependency at the same level?
2016-11-18T15:53:07 <the-t-in-rtf> I ask because I use a very similar detection algorithm.

2016-11-18T15:53:59 <cindyli> i think so in fluid.js, also kind of rmb simonjb ran into a similar root dir issue with infusion, is that true, simonjb?
2016-11-18T15:54:12 <cindyli> i think there was a fix for it
2016-11-18T15:55:19 <simonjb> I think michelled worked on the infusion fix, let me see if I can find the JIRA

2016-11-18T15:55:34 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, if you can create a ticket and mention Antranig and I, that would be helpful.  My suspicion is that in the yarn/npm 3 world we can remove the upward resolution from gpii-express.
2016-11-18T15:55:34 <cindyli> the-t-in-rtf: also noticed the latest gpii-express index.js has abaddoned this check, is it ready to be used as the dependency for gpii-pouchdb?

2016-11-18T15:55:51 <the-t-in-rtf> what do you mean by "the latest"?
2016-11-18T15:56:13 * colinclark has quit
2016-11-18T15:56:15 <cindyli> the-t-in-rtf: i mean what\'s in the master
2016-11-18T15:56:21 <cindyli> oh, the master may not be the latest
2016-11-18T15:56:22 <the-t-in-rtf> master isn\'t the latest.
2016-11-18T15:56:25 <the-t-in-rtf> right!
2016-11-18T15:56:26 <cindyli> ok
2016-11-18T15:56:37 <simonjb> https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5940
2016-11-18T15:57:15 <simonjb> was this what you were thinking of cindyli ?
2016-11-18T15:57:40 <cindyli> yes, exactly, thanks, simonjb, the-t-in-rtf ^
2016-11-18T15:57:55 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, @cindyli, if you can write up a ticket against the gpii-express component, I should be able to either follow the same strategy or verify that it\'s safe to get rid of it.
2016-11-18T15:58:44 <cindyli> sure, the-t-in-rtf, Bosmon had a pull request to fix that issue by using fluid-resolve - https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/738
2016-11-18T15:58:51 <cindyli> i will write up a ticket too
2016-11-18T15:59:04 <the-t-in-rtf> Yes, I followed the link in the issue and was reading that\xe2\x80\xa6 :)

2016-11-18T16:13:59 <alanharnum_lab> Justin_o: did you mention something to me yesterday about JAWS + Chrome crashong when you open the Upload File dialogue?
2016-11-18T16:15:21 <Bosmon> cindyli, the-t-in-rtf - I believe this problem is caused by a fault in the "resolve" module
2016-11-18T16:15:29 <Bosmon> Which is why I patched it by creating "fluid-resolve"
