2016-10-17T14:31:56 <the-t-in-rtf1> @cindyli, my concern here is that you\'re not actually waiting until the harness is recreated before firing the event.
2016-10-17T14:33:19 <Justin_o> Bosmon: I left you a question on https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-4930 regarding the PR
2016-10-17T14:33:40 <the-t-in-rtf1> for now with manual testing it\'s probably OK, but once you start automating tests, it\'s likely that you would get 404 errors about not being able to connect to the database while it\'s being recreated.
2016-10-17T14:34:50 <cindyli> the-t-in-rtf1: onReady event at https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/GPII-1274/gpii/node_modules/pouchManager/src/pouchManager.js#L79 indicates the harness is ready when the pouch manger starts, the test listens to that event for following steps

2016-10-17T14:36:36 <the-t-in-rtf1> Do you have tests for this reset and restart cycle?
2016-10-17T14:37:04 <the-t-in-rtf1> nm, found them.
2016-10-17T14:37:18 <cindyli> ok. thanks
2016-10-17T14:37:52 <the-t-in-rtf1> So, does this pass?  https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/GPII-1274/gpii/node_modules/pouchManager/test/pouchManagerTests.js#L98
2016-10-17T14:38:07 <cindyli> the-t-in-rtf1: yes, it passes
2016-10-17T14:38:14 <cindyli> with the old and new cleanup()
2016-10-17T14:38:49 <cindyli> it only checks on the response code returned by the pouch manager tho, not actual data
2016-10-17T14:39:31 <the-t-in-rtf1> The check you\'re doing should be adequate.
2016-10-17T14:39:53 <the-t-in-rtf1> i.e. if /auth returns the right stats it\'s a clear sign that the reset and restart are complete.
2016-10-17T14:40:12 <cindyli> ya, it checks on the total number of records
2016-10-17T14:43:38 <the-t-in-rtf1> http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/InfusionEventSystem.html#full-listener-record-form
2016-10-17T14:43:56 <the-t-in-rtf1> So I guess the old "listener" syntax still works? https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/GPII-1274/gpii/node_modules/pouchManager/src/pouchManager.js#L53
2016-10-17T14:44:14 <the-t-in-rtf1> The docs claim it will be deprecated in 2.0
2016-10-17T14:44:48 <the-t-in-rtf1> Anyway, just wondering as I hadn\'t seen a use of the "old" form elsewhere.

2016-10-17T18:27:41 <jhung> hi gtirloni. Do you have time 12pm ET to join me on a call with Ned from Pressbooks? Their configuration runs on Wordpress and I was wondering if we can lend some of our expertise in how we can make it easier to create dev environments (i.e. using Vagrant / Ansible?).
2016-10-17T18:28:01 <alanharnum> michelled: https://github.com/waharnum/infusion-leaflet
2016-10-17T18:28:16 <jhung> Here\'s a rough install script: https://pressbooks.org/installation/ gtirloni so you get an idea of what we\'re dealing with.
2016-10-17T18:28:58 <jhung> Sorry, that\'s 12pm ET tomorrow gtirloni.
2016-10-17T18:31:17 <gtirloni> jhung: with vagrant we can spin up a linux VM, then use ansible to install and configure mysql, php and wordpress (the basic functionality). we already have roles for mysql/php but not for wordpress I believe. I\'m available tomorrow 12pm EDT

2016-10-17T18:36:07 <ewbjr> https://inclusive-design.github.io/vidyo-webrtc-client/
2016-10-17T18:37:25 <jhung> gtirloni: Ideally for me I\'d love to just grab a VM and get everything I need to test Pressbooks. Great, I\'ll find out where we\'re meeting and send you the info. Thanks for joining last minute. :)
2016-10-17T18:37:47 <gtirloni> np :)
2016-10-17T18:39:35 <jhung> Ned @ pressbooks will send you an invite shortly gtirloni. We\'ll probably be meeting on Slack.
