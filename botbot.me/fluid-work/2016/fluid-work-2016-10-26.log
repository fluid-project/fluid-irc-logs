2016-10-26T13:21:08 <cindyli> the-t-in-rtf: i think i figured out the problem with the new gpii-pouchdb cleanup() API and created some tests to demonstrate this problem
2016-10-26T13:21:16 <cindyli> in short, this test fails - https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/GPII-1274-adapt-pouchdb-cleanup/gpii/node_modules/pouchManager/test/pouchManagerTests.js#L133-L137
2016-10-26T13:21:40 <cindyli> the problem is that, the query by a view after the cleanup() still gets the old data returned
2016-10-26T13:22:01 <the-t-in-rtf> the last time I looked at your code, you were responding to the cleanup request before cleanup was actually complete
2016-10-26T13:22:15 <the-t-in-rtf> unless I\'m misremembering.
2016-10-26T13:22:26 <cindyli> but the query by db itself or by record id returns correct number and info
2016-10-26T13:23:10 <cindyli> the-t-in-rtf: before, my tests check on the query by db itself, without checking queries by views
2016-10-26T13:24:02 <cindyli> the test in the link fails because after cleanup, this query expects a record of undefined, but the old data before the cleanup gets returned
2016-10-26T13:25:39 <the-t-in-rtf> OK, I remember what we discussed previously, you don\'t actually listen to the misleading response, but for the actual reset, here: https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/GPII-1274-adapt-pouchdb-cleanup/gpii/node_modules/pouchManager/test/pouchManagerTests.js#L124
2016-10-26T13:28:00 <cindyli> right, the-t-in-rtf, i hope the udpated tests make sense
2016-10-26T13:29:26 <cindyli> Bosmon: does kasparne_\'s doc pull request for model transformation API look good to you: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/pull/86? if it looks good, i will go ahead to merge it
2016-10-26T13:30:49 <the-t-in-rtf> @cindy, I\'d suggest writing a small function to use instead of jqUnit.assert here: https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/GPII-1274-adapt-pouchdb-cleanup/gpii/node_modules/pouchManager/test/pouchManagerTests.js#L123
2016-10-26T13:31:02 <the-t-in-rtf> the function would verify whether the FS still has content.
2016-10-26T13:31:44 <the-t-in-rtf> if the FS content is gone, the two options are a) you\'re recreating the data in a new instance as part of the initial setup or b) there\'s some piece of the old instance still living in memory
2016-10-26T13:31:48 <the-t-in-rtf> I\'m assuming it\'s b)
2016-10-26T13:32:10 <the-t-in-rtf> and I\'m assuming it\'s probably either express-pouchdb or pouchdb\'s fault
2016-10-26T13:32:52 <cindyli> btw, the-t-in-rtf, the new tests passes with the old cleanup() API
2016-10-26T13:33:33 * michelled joined the channel
2016-10-26T13:33:51 <the-t-in-rtf> yes, you mentioned that.
2016-10-26T13:34:33 <cindyli> the-t-in-rtf: i added a rimraf() call to remove the entire pouchManager baseDir before recreating pouchHarness to make sure the FS is cleaned: https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/GPII-1274-adapt-pouchdb-cleanup/gpii/node_modules/pouchManager/src/pouchManager.js#L135
2016-10-26T13:34:47 <Bosmon> cindyli - I guess we could merge it - I did want to take another look at it but it is just so impossible to review in github
2016-10-26T13:34:47 <the-t-in-rtf> That\'s all I used to do.
2016-10-26T13:34:55 <Bosmon> So perhaps "merge first and review afterwards" is better
2016-10-26T13:35:14 <cindyli> ok, will merge, Bosmon
2016-10-26T13:37:53 <cindyli> the-t-in-rtf: if I use a function at line 123 to verify the FS. I\'m think it might be hard to verify what should be gone as the old content \'cuz at that point, the FS would have some content as the pouchHarness has been recreated
2016-10-26T13:40:24 <the-t-in-rtf> right.

2016-10-26T16:14:21 <alanharnum> Justin_o: I\'m noticing there\'s a visible ARIA log on the manual test pages like http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/tests/manual-tests/framework/core/multipleVersions/
2016-10-26T16:14:27 <alanharnum> is that deliberate, or a bug?
2016-10-26T16:14:56 <alanharnum> I opened a JIRA for it (https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5991), but am now wondering if the log is intentional
2016-10-26T16:15:28 <alanharnum> i didn\'t remember seeing it before when doing manual testing
2016-10-26T16:20:39 * jhung is now known as jhung_away
2016-10-26T16:36:12 <Justin_o> alanharnum: thanks, if that\'s coming from the prior version of infusion it\'s probably because we don\'t have the style sheets included..
2016-10-26T16:36:25 <Justin_o> alanharnum: thanks for filing the bug though, it\'s worth addressing at somepoint
2016-10-26T16:38:53 <alanharnum> Justin_o: yeah, I\'m filing stuff as I find it
2016-10-26T16:38:56 <alanharnum> it may not be blockers
2016-10-26T16:39:18 <alanharnum> it\'s also present in http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/tests/manual-tests/components/inlineEdit/rich/
2016-10-26T16:40:03 <alanharnum> https://issues.fluidproject.org/projects/FLUID/issues/FLUID-5992?filter=allopenissues&orderby=created+DESC%2C+priority+DESC%2C+updated+DESC may be more of an issue if we\'re officially supproting Edge
2016-10-26T16:45:54 <avtar> fluid-everyone: in case you use hangouts and are experiencing connectivity issues: https://www.google.com/appsstatus#hl=en&v=issue&sid=22&iid=91667553ce3e09f115304593711cc164
2016-10-26T16:48:35 <Justin_o> alanharnum: ah, so if you are on the build site, not all of the demos linked there are part of infusion. So for example the First Discovery tool wouldn\'t be something we\'re concerned with for this round of testing.. although the bug report is still useful
2016-10-26T16:49:03 <Justin_o> alanharnum: it might need to be moved to another JIRA project though
2016-10-26T16:49:41 <Justin_o> alanharnum: yes, i think it should be under the FLOE project in JIRA instead of FLUID
2016-10-26T16:50:37 <alanharnum> Justin_o: ah, ok
2016-10-26T16:50:48 <Justin_o> alanharnum: i just moved it https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLOE-489

2016-10-26T17:49:24 <Justin_o> for the sliders
2016-10-26T17:49:34 <Justin_o> alanharnum: also, was it only in a specific environment?

2016-10-26T17:50:00 <alanharnum> was present in both
2016-10-26T17:50:17 <Justin_o> alanharnum: thanks, could you update the environment section of the JIRA you filed with that info

2016-10-26T17:52:16 <Justin_o> Kobi and David123_ : here are the testing tasks for our Infusion release https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yFJotFr4_HJhNK-kwAxjE4gCozJYu48xIIjkA91gloU/edit?usp=sharing it would be great if you could help with the testing this week.
2016-10-26T17:52:28 <Justin_o> I can go over the details with you, if you like
2016-10-26T17:53:00 <alanharnum> Justin_o: done - also confirmed present in Safari/Firefox on Mac.
2016-10-26T17:53:24 <David123_> Justin_o: thanks that would be nice
