2016-05-20T17:26:38 * Dinuka_ joined the channel
2016-05-20T17:26:50 <colinclark> by all reports, they're passing nicely on both Linux and OS X
2016-05-20T17:26:57 <colinclark> I will just check Windows 10

2016-05-20T17:34:29 <colinclark> so I'm going to SHIP IT as soon as my current conference call is over

2016-05-20T17:43:10 <avtar> simonjb: yes that would be awesome
2016-05-20T17:43:20 <simonjb> ok, great

2016-05-20T15:20:24 <the-t-in-rtf> I am about ten minutes from going offline, just saw your note.
2016-05-20T15:21:17 <avtar> the-t-in-rtf: ah ok
2016-05-20T15:21:42 <the-t-in-rtf> I usually work until 17:30 CET, i.e. 9 minutes from now.
2016-05-20T15:21:54 <the-t-in-rtf> I have a slot Monday if you like.
2016-05-20T15:22:11 <the-t-in-rtf> That way you can actually take care of yourself, get ahead of the cold.
2016-05-20T15:22:29 <avtar> monday is a statutory holiday here, tuesday morning would work for me
2016-05-20T15:29:03 <the-t-in-rtf> I am slammed from 15:00-17:00, I could meet from 17:00-17:30 as long as we keep it snappy.
2016-05-20T15:29:40 <the-t-in-rtf> Also, I hope it\'s poutine day or something fun.
2016-05-20T15:29:51 <the-t-in-rtf> Huh.  Just googled that, it was May 1st.
2016-05-20T15:31:36 <avtar> i didn\'t know poutine day was a thing

2016-05-20T16:31:18 <colinclark> hey avtar
2016-05-20T16:31:38 <colinclark> simonjb: How are you feeling about Kettle?
2016-05-20T16:31:43 <avtar> colinclark: hi
2016-05-20T16:31:46 <colinclark> Shall I do one last quick review and test and then merge it?
2016-05-20T16:31:59 <colinclark> avtar: So I\'ve really been getting a lot of benefit out of QI-related tools
2016-05-20T16:32:04 <colinclark> in one of my "side projects"
2016-05-20T16:32:26 <colinclark> hopefully one that simonjb and I will connect up with the Nexus eventually
2016-05-20T16:32:47 <avtar> nice :)
2016-05-20T16:32:55 <colinclark> avtar: This is the part I\'m most excited about right now: https://github.com/colinbdclark/osc.js/blob/gh-54/package.json#L45
2016-05-20T16:33:02 <simonjb> colinclark: I\'m feeling good about Kettle -- I ran the tests locally here on Linux and also updated Nexus to latest Kettle and ran its tests
2016-05-20T16:33:08 <colinclark> ok cool
2016-05-20T16:33:29 <colinclark> simonjb: Sounds like I should run through the tests on Mac and the Moonbook
2016-05-20T16:33:32 <colinclark> and then we can SHIP IT
2016-05-20T16:34:01 <colinclark> avtar: Right now I have a bit of Vagrant action going on too: https://github.com/colinbdclark/osc.js/blob/gh-54/provisioning/vars.yml
2016-05-20T16:34:07 <simonjb> yes colinclark, that sounds good to me
2016-05-20T16:34:16 <colinclark> This library runs in many different environments
2016-05-20T16:34:22 <colinclark> most prominently Node.js and in browsers
2016-05-20T16:34:43 <colinclark> Eventually I\'m goign to take the-t-in-rtf\'s lead and do some combined browser/server integration testing
2016-05-20T16:34:57 <colinclark> but I think even now I\'d like to at least be able to run that npm script using Vagrant
2016-05-20T16:35:11 <colinclark> and then maybe be a full QI participant
2016-05-20T16:35:16 <colinclark> so my question for you, avtar
2016-05-20T16:35:35 <colinclark> What would I have to do to change my vagrant setup so it\'s more like the one Infusion operates
2016-05-20T16:35:46 <colinclark> where tests run in real browsers on either Windows or Linux as well as Node.js?
2016-05-20T16:36:29 <colinclark> and following that, what would I need to do to actually add osc.js to the QI?
2016-05-20T16:38:15 <avtar> colinclark: i\'ve come across examples in the testem repo that use different launchers
2016-05-20T16:39:04 <avtar> either for browsers or command line environments for using tools like mocha, etc.
2016-05-20T16:40:22 <avtar> colinclark: https://github.com/testem/testem/blob/master/examples/node_example/testem.json
2016-05-20T16:42:53 <avtar> and then it\'s possible to specify particular launchers as command line arguments https://github.com/testem/testem/blob/master/docs/config_file.md#cli-level-options
2016-05-20T16:44:05 <avtar> which could be added as additional entries in your package.json
2016-05-20T16:44:52 <avtar> that\'s one approach that comes to mind
2016-05-20T16:49:01 <colinclark> ok
2016-05-20T16:50:40 * Dinuka joined the channel
2016-05-20T16:51:23 <avtar> re: adding osc.js as a qi project it might be less work on your part if we either do that after we\'ve moved away from the gpii/ci-service approach and only use config files and/or if you have time and are willing to help test that then we can try a config file approach in a test branch of your project
2016-05-20T17:04:33 <colinclark> ok
2016-05-20T17:04:40 <colinclark> i\'d happily be a guinea pig, avtar
2016-05-20T17:06:17 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2016-05-20T17:06:18 <avtar> that would be very helpful :P
2016-05-20T17:08:31 <avtar> are you free on tuesday 11:00 am to go over details?
2016-05-20T17:09:54 <avtar> simonjb helped me discern the difference cet and cest time zones so i\'m pretty sure i\'m getting this right now and that\'s when tony will be available
2016-05-20T17:10:30 <colinclark> avtar: lemme check
2016-05-20T17:11:03 <colinclark> Looks like 11 am EDT on Tuesday works for me

2016-05-20T17:26:24 <Bosmon> Not as many as for universal
2016-05-20T17:26:27 <Bosmon> Which has 777 tests
2016-05-20T17:26:32 <colinclark> oh wow
