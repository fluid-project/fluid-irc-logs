b"2016-07-13T17:01:16 <avtar> then the installer won't build until the unit and acceptance tests pass
2016-07-13T17:01:26 <gloob> I like that
2016-07-13T17:01:53 <gloob> also it will match with the way we are implementing the rpms generation in linux, right?
2016-07-13T17:03:09 * wale joined the channel
2016-07-13T17:03:15 <avtar> that's a good question
2016-07-13T17:03:30 <gloob> amatas: around?
2016-07-13T17:03:30 <avtar> https://github.com/GPII/linux/pull/84
2016-07-13T17:03:49 <avtar> the linux ci job will need to be updated once that's merged
2016-07-13T17:03:57 <gloob> https://github.com/GPII/linux/pull/84
2016-07-13T17:03:59 <gloob> yuep
2016-07-13T17:04:36 <avtar> and then the approach would be the same as the windows package build
2016-07-13T17:04:45 <avtar> s/package/installer/
2016-07-13T17:05:08 <gloob> yes, the only thing amatas told me that we should approach differently is that we prefer npm over grunt for some tasks
2016-07-13T17:05:12 <gloob> right?
2016-07-13T17:05:53 <avtar> yes, there seems to be less reliance on grunt now than in the past
2016-07-13T17:06:23 <gloob> ok
2016-07-13T17:06:46 <gloob> so, summarizing, we want to integrate the windows installer in the main windows repository
2016-07-13T17:07:15 <avtar> yes but i would confirm on the arch list :)
2016-07-13T17:07:19 <gloob> 2) oh sure
2016-07-13T17:07:57 <gloob> 2) this PR https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/76 needs more work
2016-07-13T17:08:41 <gloob> 3) we want to reuse as much as we can of the existing vagrant machines and provisioning files
2016-07-13T17:09:23 <gloob> 4) we will integrate it as another job in the multijob jenkins schema based on the success of the previous jobs
2016-07-13T17:09:26 <gloob> something else?
2016-07-13T17:09:49 <avtar> 5) you still owe me dinner
2016-07-13T17:10:08 <avtar> but 1 - 4 is a reasonable sounding list
2016-07-13T17:10:31 <gloob> I *don't* remember 5
2016-07-13T17:10:38 <avtar> it's in the channel logs

2016-07-13T18:16:16 <wannabeCitizen> Hey friends, question about events in fluid: does a listener have to be related to an event declared in the same component? If not, why might I be getting an error in the JS console saying \xe2\x80\x9da Listener is registered for an event not defined for this component..\xe2\x80\x9d

2016-07-13T20:20:10 <alanharnum> wannabeCitizen: you can have listeners registered for events taking place in other components, but if you're getting that message it's generally because the listener cannot find a corresponding event
2016-07-13T20:20:55 <alanharnum> is the problem code somewhere i can take a look at it?

2016-07-13T16:32:14 <gloob> *The website at https://ci.gpii.net is now the live Jenkins instance*. The old "ci-int" is deprecated and will be slowly phased out.
2016-07-13T16:32:20 <gloob> gtirloni: that\'s true?
2016-07-13T16:32:25 <gloob> no more ci-int?
2016-07-13T16:34:31 <avtar> gloob: correct :D
2016-07-13T16:35:54 <gloob> that\'s amazing
2016-07-13T16:36:50 <gloob> avtar: ok, so my topic is about this PR https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/76
2016-07-13T16:36:57 <gloob> avtar: do you have time now?

2016-07-13T16:39:43 <avtar> gloob: sure
2016-07-13T16:39:52 <avtar> do you want to chat here or on vidyo?
2016-07-13T16:41:07 <gloob> avtar: I think it\'s pretty fast, we can discuss it here
2016-07-13T16:41:48 <avtar> ok
2016-07-13T16:42:32 <gloob> So the main question is which approach to take for the installers, as you can see in that pull request the SILO idea is to integrate into the main windows repository
2016-07-13T16:43:08 <gloob> I think, that\'s better to stick to the specific repository idea, meaning to maintain all the stuff for the installer in the windows-installer repo
2016-07-13T16:43:31 <gloob> basically the installer build process just make a clone of the windows repository
2016-07-13T16:44:30 <avtar> sorry, one sec
2016-07-13T16:44:36 <gloob> and I think that instead of add all the specific stuff for the installer build into the main windows repository we can add it in the installer repository, and inject this ansible file into the collection of provisioning files
2016-07-13T16:44:37 <avtar> just taking a look at the pr details
2016-07-13T16:45:17 <gloob> that pr is adding the new provisioning/build-installer.bat into the windows repository
2016-07-13T16:45:41 <gloob> and the rest of build software needed by the installer
2016-07-13T16:45:57 * the-t-in-rtf has quit
2016-07-13T16:47:43 <avtar> hmm
2016-07-13T16:48:37 <avtar> why would you not want the installer related bits to be part of the main windows repo?
2016-07-13T16:50:01 <gloob> well, it\'s a good question
2016-07-13T16:50:04 <gloob> all or nothing
2016-07-13T16:50:27 <gloob> but if you see the build logic if the installer here https://github.com/GPII/gpii-wix-installer/blob/master/setup/build.cmd
2016-07-13T16:52:05 * kasparnet has quit
2016-07-13T16:52:16 <gloob> basically is mimicking the process we are doing https://github.com/GPII/windows/blob/master/provisioning/build.bat
2016-07-13T16:53:02 <avtar> this https://github.com/GPII/gpii-wix-installer/blob/master/setup/build.cmd#L18-L32 isn\'t required anymore
2016-07-13T16:53:19 <gloob> I know
2016-07-13T16:53:19 <avtar> https://github.com/GPII/windows/blob/master/package.json#L13
2016-07-13T16:53:32 <gloob> there\'s a lot of of outdated stuff there
2016-07-13T16:53:57 <avtar> and i see what you mean about the duplicated steps
2016-07-13T16:54:10 <gloob> the main target is, I want the same vagrant/docker machine for the testing of windows and for the build of windows installers
2016-07-13T16:54:38 <gloob> and separated provisioning stuff for the windows installer builds than for the windows testing
2016-07-13T16:55:04 <gloob> but, from the installer point of view, they see windows and universal as a whole
2016-07-13T16:55:15 <gloob> and probably it will need to take care in the future of
2016-07-13T16:55:30 <gloob> other software, like jaws or any other at tool we want to incorporate
2016-07-13T16:55:37 <gloob> do we want all of that in the windows repository?
2016-07-13T16:56:45 <gloob> and I\'m one of the main supporter of the monolithic approach, but
2016-07-13T16:56:53 <avtar> i personally would since it\'ll be convenient
2016-07-13T16:57:33 <avtar> i would want the installer to be built as part of the windows ci task as well :)
2016-07-13T16:58:23 <gloob> exactly, that\'s another goal, to be triggered (the windows installer generation) as step of the windows ci task
2016-07-13T16:58:32 <gloob> or do we want another job for that?
2016-07-13T17:00:19 <avtar> we currently use a multijob plugin for the ci service so the installer build could be another job here https://github.com/GPII/ci-service/blob/master/jenkins_jobs/windows.yml#L93
