2016-03-21T19:11:03 <Justin_o> jhung: okay... so that\'s some good news i guess. Hope your next VM will work better.. It would be good to find out what happened though, so maybe keep a copy of your current one around and we can try to figure things out later.

2016-03-21T19:50:33 <gabrielmancini> hello every one, i was trying to deploy the server components on (cf) bluemix, but i have a doubt about configurations. in cf apps the PORT has set by enviroment to a variable and i need to read that variable like: process.env.PORT how i do this on config static files?

2016-03-21T19:52:07 * jhung1 has quit
2016-03-21T19:53:29 <gtirloni> Justin_o: do we support reading from env vars in the config files? i remember we discussed it but my memory is failing about this subject ^^
2016-03-21T19:54:35 <gabrielmancini> some how i need pass the PORT configuration from env to ketle server right?
2016-03-21T19:55:08 <gabrielmancini> and i only have static files inside the config folder
2016-03-21T19:55:39 <gabrielmancini> i was wondering if there is a way to get the configuration dinamic
2016-03-21T20:02:47 <gabrielmancini> some one knows how?
2016-03-21T20:04:16 <gtirloni> gabrielmancini: with our deployment we\'ve relied on modifying the config file on the file (something like a `sed -i`) but there was a discussion a few months ago about supporting env vars, reading from files, etc. Justin_o and Bosmon know more about that, I can\'t remember where we stand on that.

2016-03-21T21:41:10 <akshay> danayo, Justin_o: I have replied back to your comments and am working to modify it based on your feedback.
2016-03-21T21:41:40 <danayo> great akshay
2016-03-21T21:44:59 <akshay> Is the idea of wizard mailbox system bad? I had thought that you people would like it
2016-03-21T21:46:03 <akshay> and Justin was talking about some design flaws.. do I need to reconsider this, I have given my explanation for why I intend to use this in the comments.
2016-03-21T21:51:06 <danayo> akshay I think Justin_o was just suggesting that sometimes it\'s better to try to make the game itself more intuitive (so, the less direct instruction needed, the better). There\'s nothing inherently wrong with a "wizard". and it\'s totally up to you whether you want to reconsider anything at this point - our comments are really just suggestions, and your added comment/explanation makes your intention clear

2016-03-21T21:57:27 <akshay> yes I think that my added comment justifies it. Actually this is my first ever proposal for GSoC I don\'t know how other students do, I thought I wrote a bad proposal as you both got too many flaws with this.

2016-03-21T22:24:52 <danayo> akshay, your proposal is good. the comments are suggestions and intended to help guide you. most importantly we want to make sure to fill in any gaps where we need more information from you in order to be able to fairly assess your prooposal.
2016-03-21T22:26:48 <akshay> thanks danayo. would you guys be replying back to my comments as I didn\'t got a few of them.
2016-03-21T22:29:16 <akshay> I cannot upload all my projects online as for a few I am not allowed to do so and some of them were like say django, I learnt it made a blog and I don\'t have the code now.
2016-03-21T22:29:27 <akshay> I didn\'t use github then.
2016-03-21T22:31:06 <akshay> same is the case with sdl and c, 3 years back I learn it on youtube made a small game, I don\'t have that code. So should I not mention those small projects (after all I know those tools)
2016-03-21T22:31:53 <akshay> or should I only write about big projects that has been pushed to github and production version are there online like my Moodly project that I worked on.

2016-03-21T16:03:53 <akshay> thanks Justin. I would wait for you inputs. Yes mockups are taking more space but it\'s a little detailed as well so that you can have a nice idea of how
2016-03-21T16:03:56 <Blagoj> I\'ve read that I will need to send the CLA document too. By the way, I\'ve submitted my proposal and feedback will be appreciated
