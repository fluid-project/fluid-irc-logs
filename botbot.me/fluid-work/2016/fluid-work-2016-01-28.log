b'2016-01-28T15:22:18 <Justin_o> also are they available in all installation types, for example if you use the windows installer?
2016-01-28T15:22:26 <Bosmon> https://github.com/GPII/universal#testing
2016-01-28T15:23:05 <Bosmon> I don\'t know about the windows installer, since I don\'t know who (if anyone) owns that
2016-01-28T15:23:43 <Bosmon> There are arch-specific tests too, but they are rather more ropy
2016-01-28T15:24:10 <Bosmon> https://github.com/GPII/windows/tree/master/tests
2016-01-28T15:24:15 <Bosmon> etc.
2016-01-28T15:24:36 <Bosmon> https://github.com/GPII/windows/blob/master/tests/UnitTests.js
2016-01-28T15:24:57 <Justin_o> Bosmon: basically i\'m writing up the test plans for the PGA stuff and want to have something to run after install of GPII to ensure that it is installed correctly
2016-01-28T15:25:21 <Justin_o> i figure 1) run some unit test 2) login and logout with a specific user
2016-01-28T15:25:31 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes
2016-01-28T15:25:40 <Justin_o> Bosmon: is the first set of tests enough for that?
2016-01-28T15:25:46 <Justin_o> and what\'s a good user these days?
2016-01-28T15:26:42 <Bosmon> Typically we login with "sammy" since that isn\'t likely to screw the system up too much
2016-01-28T15:26:43 <Bosmon> https://wiki.gpii.net/w/Setting_Up_Your_Development_Environment#Troubleshooting
2016-01-28T15:27:42 <Justin_o> Bosmon: great, so i can login and logout with sammy and run those acceptance tests
2016-01-28T15:28:19 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes
2016-01-28T15:28:43 <Bosmon> Note that the acceptance tests on windows will leave the system in a corrupted condition, although they will pass
2016-01-28T15:28:52 <Bosmon> So I wouldn\'t recommend these for general users on a real system
2016-01-28T15:29:21 <Bosmon> Running the test suite from universal is always safe
2016-01-28T15:32:05 <Justin_o> Bosmon: this is safe "node tests\\all-tests.js"?
2016-01-28T15:32:40 <Bosmon> Justin_o - all universal tests are always safe, yes
2016-01-28T15:33:07 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay, i might just stick with those then, i don\'t want to leave the system in a corrupt state, it might through off the rest of the tests
2016-01-28T15:34:00 <Justin_o> Bosmon: could you also remind what the url is for checking which preferences are associated with a gpii token
2016-01-28T15:34:06 <Justin_o> i want to know what sammy sets
2016-01-28T15:35:14 <Bosmon> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/preferences/sammy.json
2016-01-28T15:40:35 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks

2016-01-28T15:42:28 <Justin_o> Bosmon: what is the expected outcome of Sammy\'s prefs.. it has foreground: white, background: black, and invert colours is true.. so should the foreground actually be black?
2016-01-28T15:42:58 <alanharnum> a quick Infusion model relaying question: can I set up a model relaying from itself to itself (i.e. from {that}.model.objectA.valueB to {that}.model.valueB) with the implicit relaying, or do I need to use the longer form?
2016-01-28T15:44:15 <alanharnum> I couldn\'t get an implicit relay of the style described to work, but that may mean i\'m not using the right IOCSS syntax etc
2016-01-28T15:45:33 <alanharnum> it\'s also possible (looking at what I just wrote) that this approach is convoluted and the code should simply be listening to changes to objectA.valueB in the circumstances I describe

2016-01-28T17:24:42 <danayo> hi gtirloni, on the PGA email list I\'m seeing that some people are using globalpreferences@fluidproject.org and some are using globalpreferences@lists.idrc.ocad.ca - can you tell me if one is older and/or if we should be recommending one or the other?
2016-01-28T17:28:04 <danayo> gtirloni_ ^
2016-01-28T17:29:46 <gtirloni_> danayo: when that list was created, the domain lists.idrc.ocad.ca domain was specified. if it\'s working with fluidproject.org it\'s only by chance (hosted on the same server)
2016-01-28T17:31:44 <michelled> jhung: I\'d love to hear about your trip
2016-01-28T17:32:29 <michelled> it would be really good to get a sense of the work coming out of it
2016-01-28T17:34:13 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2016-01-28T17:34:41 <danayo> ok gtirloni_ , so that means emails sent to either one will go to all members of lists.idrc.ocad.ca ? I seem to be signed up to one under my ocad address and one under gmail ...
2016-01-28T17:36:35 <gtirloni_> danayo: there is a "GlobalPreferences" and a "Preferences" list
2016-01-28T17:37:36 <gtirloni_> "GlobalPreferences" is globalpreferences@lists.idrc.ocad.ca
2016-01-28T17:37:47 <gtirloni_> "Preferences" is preferences@lists.gpii.net
2016-01-28T17:39:23 <gtirloni> it seems people have been mixing them in their posts
2016-01-28T17:39:40 <gtirloni> http://lists.gpii.net/pipermail/preferences/2016-January/thread.html
2016-01-28T17:39:45 <gtirloni> http://lists.idrc.ocad.ca/pipermail/globalpreferences/2016-January/thread.html
2016-01-28T17:40:19 <gtirloni> i don\'t know the background for these lists, but if they are the same, we should merge them
2016-01-28T17:40:48 <danayo> hmmm...i\'m confused gitirloni, i\'m not sure if the GPII should remain separate or not
2016-01-28T17:41:46 <gtirloni> michelled jessm: ^ we seem to have two separate list for what seems the same purpose?
2016-01-28T17:41:47 <jhung> michelled: We\'re still trying to figure out what the outcomes are from this trip. jessm, Ahrash, and I are meeting next week to discuss my impressions and I assume the "what\'s next?" question will come up.
2016-01-28T17:42:29 <danayo> and gtirloni i\'m still wondering if emails sent to either globalpreferences@fluidproject.org or globalpreferences@lists.idrc.ocad.ca will go to all members of lists.idrc.ocad.ca ?
2016-01-28T17:42:44 <danayo> it doesn\'t seem so
2016-01-28T17:42:52 <jhung> For now the immediate work items are to create an ILDH resource about modal dialogs and how to use / avoid them (this was a design issue coming out of EdReady and NROC).
2016-01-28T17:42:55 <jhung> ^michelled
2016-01-28T17:44:00 <gtirloni> danayo: no, they shound\'t. the lists are separate
2016-01-28T17:45:20 <danayo> ok, i guess i don\'t understand what the globalpreferences@fluidproject.org list is then, and what you mean by it working by chance
2016-01-28T17:48:49 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2016-01-28T17:51:21 <gtirloni> danayo: after checking their settings more closely, i don\'t think it\'s working by chance. they are separate lists, with different subscribers
2016-01-28T17:52:39 <gtirloni> danayo: for instance, when Gregg sent an email about "a personalization app - ... ces 2016" ... he sent it to both lists himself. there was no forwarding or duplication on the server side
2016-01-28T17:54:22 <gtirloni> danayo: you seem to be subscribed only to globalpreferences@lists.idrc.ocad.ca... if you\'ve been getting emails where preferences@lists.gpii.net is mentioned, please check if it\'s not just a copy to both lists
2016-01-28T18:02:25 <danayo> yes gtirloni, i\'m not subscribed to preferences@lists.gpii.net (and am not sure what that list is all about) but i\'m getting emails from both globalpreferences@fluidproject.org and globalpreferences@lists.idrc.ocad.ca - and my concern is that these should be one and the same
2016-01-28T18:03:54 <gtirloni> globalpreferences@lists.idrc.ocad.ca and globalpreferences@fluidproject.org are the same list
2016-01-28T18:06:49 <danayo> ah ok gtirloni
2016-01-28T18:07:20 <alanharnum> Bosmon cindyli: I just dropped a short story into https://github.com/fluid-project/chartAuthoring/pull/11 about a weird thing I\'m seeing with fluid.test.testCaseHolder after refactoring the synth per colinclark\'s suggestion
2016-01-28T18:08:17 <alanharnum> i suspect it may be a mismatch between the Infusion version I\'m using and the Infusion version Flocking expects, or something equally fun to debug
2016-01-28T18:08:33 <alanharnum> any insights or suggestions would be awesome :/
2016-01-28T18:09:06 <cindyli> alanharnum: i will take a look and let you know if any findings
2016-01-28T18:11:29 <alanharnum> thanks cindyli - it\'s not a blocker to working on other things for me so not super-urgent, don\'t spent too much time if it\'s not an obvious issue
2016-01-28T18:11:51 <cindyli> ok, i see
2016-01-28T18:12:27 <alanharnum> i can work on other refactoring pieces, i suspect this may take colinclark to answer if it\'s a Flocking issue

2016-01-28T18:17:40 <alanharnum> Bosmon: yeah clown_mtg showed me that - it\'s really handy

2016-01-28T18:50:03 <jessm> ah ha! danayo i think i get it
2016-01-28T18:51:51 <jessm> at 12:37 you and gtirloni had a misunderstanding :) you started talking about three different lists, not just the two you had questions about. I myself have been curious about the preferences@lists.gpii.net \xe2\x80\x94 i don\xe2\x80\x99t know it and i\xe2\x80\x99ve seen it fly by on occassion. i think that\xe2\x80\x99s a kasper question how that list came about and i have no idea who is subscribed there
2016-01-28T18:52:41 <jessm> at 1:03 gtirloni said the magic words regarding the two lists you were wondering about \xe2\x80\x94  they are the same, just two diff. domain names. i guess the only follow-up question to that is, does it matter which one you send it to?
2016-01-28T18:53:15 <jessm> michelled: maybe you know a thing or two about the kasper-like list preferences@lists.gpii.net?

2016-01-28T19:00:52 * anastasiac has quit
2016-01-28T19:01:58 <jhung> michelled: I was wondering what you think of renaming the Jira component currently called "Design Handbook"? I\'ve been putting ILDH issues there, but historically the component was made for the UX Toolkit.
2016-01-28T19:02:03 * anastasiac joined the channel
2016-01-28T19:25:46 <jessm> gtirloni: i typed some messages to danayo above (while you were out i think) regarding the lists convo you two had earlier
2016-01-28T19:26:01 <jessm> i wonder if you can take a look in the logs and grade me on accuracy? :P
2016-01-28T19:29:47 <gtirloni> jessm: hey, grade: A+
2016-01-28T19:29:58 <jessm> gtirloni: yay! lol
2016-01-28T19:30:37 <gtirloni> if the @fluidproject.org address is causing confusion, i can try to find a way to block that.. i\'d have to check because we use a 3rd-party anti-spam service
2016-01-28T19:31:05 <jessm> gtirloni: if someone sends to either of those lists addresses, it gets delivered to the same ppl, right?
2016-01-28T19:33:44 <gtirloni> jessm: yeah, any globalpreferences@ address will go to the same list. the thing is: the mailing list software doesn\'t know about domains too much... it has a single global namespace where "globalpreferences" exists with lists from any other domain. if the email is sneaky and finds a way to appear in front of the mailing list software, it looks at the name in front of \'@\' and determines the list it should go too
2016-01-28T19:34:36 <gtirloni> our mail goes through a service called spamhero.com, it has fluidproject.org, lists.idrc.ocad.ca and lists.gpii.net configured.... it\'s probably getting the emails to globalpreferences@fluidproject.org and just forwarding to our server
2016-01-28T19:36:39 <jessm> ah, that makes sense. so even if we\xe2\x80\x99ve fazed out the fluidproject.org domain, if someone sends to that old address it\xe2\x80\x99ll still get delivered just by virtue of having \xe2\x80\x9cglobalpreferences\xe2\x80\x9d in the to \xe2\x80\x94 that makes sense.
2016-01-28T19:36:50 <gtirloni> yeah, just confirmed... globalpreferences@ exists for both domains in spamhero.com. i can delete the one for fludproject.org if you guys want
2016-01-28T19:37:19 <jessm> but if you do that then what happens if someone uses that address?
2016-01-28T19:37:26 <gtirloni> it bounces back
2016-01-28T19:37:47 <jessm> gtirloni: that might not be desireable
2016-01-28T19:38:17 <jessm> if the recipients are the same regardless of what address it\xe2\x80\x99s sent to, is there a reason to delete the one domain name?
2016-01-28T19:38:28 <gtirloni> (spamhero.com has a feature where it "learns" addresses.. someone may have sent to globalpreferences@fluidproject.org at one time, spamhero tried to deliver to us, we accepted because the list exists.. and then it added that address to the list of approved addresses)
2016-01-28T19:39:41 <gtirloni> the only reason i can think of is to keep things organized.. but it\'s nothing major. it doesn\'t cause us any problems i guess
2016-01-28T19:40:30 <gtirloni> i think the confusion may have started when people started to cross-post between globalpreferences@ and preferences@gpii...
2016-01-28T19:41:36 <jessm> gtirloni: i think we used to use @fluidproject.org for all our lists, no? and in the avtar-ian era we switched to @lists? or i\xe2\x80\x99m remembering that wrong, it was @idrc and now it\xe2\x80\x99s @lists.idrc \xe2\x80\x94 avtar you know?
2016-01-28T19:42:10 <jessm> gtirloni: i have an email from 2012 to globalpreferences@fluidproject.org
2016-01-28T19:42:22 <gtirloni> ah, that\'d explain it
2016-01-28T19:42:33 <jessm> this project \xe2\x80\x94 PGA has had issues with where to settle its lists \xe2\x80\x94 i think there was even a google list at one point
2016-01-28T19:42:35 <gtirloni> we don\'t even have a lists.fluidproject.org address anymore though
2016-01-28T19:43:45 <jessm> my memory isn\xe2\x80\x99t the greatest, but there was a domain name switch in there \xe2\x80\x94 don\xe2\x80\x99t remember when
2016-01-28T19:43:53 <avtar> jessm, gtirloni: lists.fluidproject.org used to be served by a vm that had been decommissioned before i joined the idrc
2016-01-28T19:44:21 <avtar> so all the @fluidproject.org lists were (and are) hosted on the same mailman server
2016-01-28T19:44:25 <jessm> there we go
2016-01-28T19:44:29 <avtar> as the idrc and gpii ones
2016-01-28T19:49:36 <anastasiac> michelled: Just a gentle reminder about this docs pull request to add license information: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/pull/78
2016-01-28T19:49:57 <michelled> jhung: thanks for the update
2016-01-28T19:50:08 <michelled> jhung: what did you want to rename the JIRA component to?
2016-01-28T19:50:17 <michelled> jessm: I don\'t know about those lists - sorry
2016-01-28T19:50:44 <jhung> michelled: first, does it make sense to rename the component or create a new one?
2016-01-28T19:51:30 <michelled> jhung: I could imagine us reviving the design handbook someday
2016-01-28T19:51:52 <jhung> ok michelled so I guess it makes more sense to make a new component for ILDH then.
2016-01-28T19:51:59 <michelled> jhung: but I wonder if it would be fine to use the same JIRA component for all our design handbooks
2016-01-28T19:52:10 <jhung> yeah\xe2\x80\xa6
2016-01-28T19:52:38 <jhung> that\'s an option michelled. Perhaps rename it "Design handbooks" instead of just "handbook"?
2016-01-28T19:54:42 <danayo> jessm gtirloni thanks for the discussion and clarification - sounds like we agree it doesn\'t matter which one gets used
2016-01-28T19:55:01 <danayo> which one meaning which globalpreferences@

2016-01-28T14:51:26 <anastasiac> Justin_o: Did you deploy to production? or do you want me to do that?

2016-01-28T14:51:58 <anastasiac> thanks
2016-01-28T14:54:58 <anastasiac> yes, Justin_o. I guess the VP project isn\xe2\x80\x99t tied to github for auto-closure\xe2\x80\xa6
2016-01-28T14:55:58 <Justin_o> anastasiac: was that a pull request for video player or another repo?
2016-01-28T14:56:14 <anastasiac> other repo: https://github.com/inclusive-design/infusion-videoPlayer-wp-plugin/pull/7
2016-01-28T14:56:55 <Justin_o> anastasiac: thanks, it's probably that none of these repos are hooked up.. i guess they should be though eh
2016-01-28T14:57:12 <anastasiac> well, it is nice...
2016-01-28T14:57:53 <Justin_o> anastasiac: i left a note for myself.. i'll try to do that at some point
