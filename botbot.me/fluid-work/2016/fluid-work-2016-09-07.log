2016-09-07T12:57:16 <Justin_o> part 2 of the sonification video
2016-09-07T12:57:22 <jhung> thanks Justin_o.

2016-09-07T13:20:45 <colinclark> Is there a link somewhere to the sonification video so that I can catch up, Justin_o or jhung?
2016-09-07T13:25:35 <jhung> yes colinclark, it isn't a public link. I'll send it to you privately.
2016-09-07T13:30:11 <jhung> Justin_o: I tried to get a sharable link to the sonification video. When I tried to get the link, the item disappeared from my google drive. Can you check the shared folder and see if it's still there?
2016-09-07T13:33:11 <colinclark> Where did the video come from?
2016-09-07T13:34:07 <jhung> It was a recording of the sonification primer meeting from a couple weeks ago colinclark. Emily recorded it and saved it to a shared google drive folder.
2016-09-07T13:34:23 <colinclark> ah, I see
2016-09-07T13:34:24 <jhung> I can share that folder with you now colinclark and maybe you can see it? Because it's gone for me.
2016-09-07T13:34:36 * alanharnum joined the channel
2016-09-07T13:34:44 <colinclark> The primer that Bruce Walker gave to the PhET team, is that right, jhung?
2016-09-07T13:34:52 <jhung> yes colinclark.
2016-09-07T13:34:59 <colinclark> cool
2016-09-07T13:35:00 * yzen is now known as yzen_
2016-09-07T13:37:03 <jhung> I shared the drive with you now colinclark. The video should be under Meeting Materials > Sonification Primer > something.mp4
2016-09-07T13:38:01 <cindyli> the-t-in-rtf: i start working on pouch-backed in browser testing. wanna make sure if this is the gpii-pouchdb component I can make use of for this matter: https://github.com/the-t-in-rtf/gpii-pouchdb/blob/GPII-1897/docs/pouchdb.md
2016-09-07T13:38:10 * simonjb joined the channel
2016-09-07T13:38:33 <the-t-in-rtf> yes, that's it.  We will likely discuss some changes to the way it works in our meeting next week, though.
2016-09-07T13:39:30 <danayo> jhung: could I have access to the sonification video too? assuming that's Part 1 to the Part 2 that we'll look at today?

2016-09-07T13:40:36 <cindyli> cool. thanks, the-t-in-rtf. the meeting next week will be on Wednesday instead of Monday, right?
2016-09-07T13:40:49 <the-t-in-rtf> Yes, I had a makeup meeting at our usual time.
2016-09-07T13:40:54 <cindyli> great. thanks
2016-09-07T13:41:52 <jhung> danayo: welcome back. I'll get you a link as well. Until Emily is back, I'll just have to share the files individually.
2016-09-07T13:42:02 <danayo> ok, thanks jhung

2016-09-07T14:10:02 <jhung> Justin_o: it seems that the sonification video has disappeared from the shared drive when I attempted to get a shared link of it. Can you re-upload the video to the Aug 3 meeting notes  folder? I don't have a copy.
2016-09-07T14:10:52 * kasparnet has quit
2016-09-07T14:11:23 <Justin_o> it looks like it's still there for me
2016-09-07T14:11:28 <Justin_o> jhung: ^
2016-09-07T14:11:48 <jhung> Justin_o: really? colinclark and I don't see it. Can you check the permissions on that file?
2016-09-07T14:13:16 <Justin_o> jhung: try again now
2016-09-07T14:13:54 <jhung> that did it Justin_o. Thanks! colinclark refresh that folder and see if that fixed it.

2016-09-07T14:27:23 <colinclark> but I'm glad we didn't lose the file :)
2016-09-07T14:29:13 * jhung shakes fist angrily at technology
2016-09-07T14:29:42 <jhung> what the\xe2\x80\xa6 it's gone again.
2016-09-07T14:29:48 <jhung> Justin_o: are you seeing this?
2016-09-07T14:30:11 <jhung> I really can't make sense of what is going on here.
2016-09-07T14:30:53 <Justin_o> jhung: i'm looking at it still, but I'm seeing the activity and it keeps getting reset back to anyone from colorado.edu
2016-09-07T14:30:55 <Justin_o> not sure how
2016-09-07T14:32:34 <jhung> The last thing I did was copy the link to the video for danayo. I think the act of getting that link is what causes the permissions to reset Justin_o. I'll just make a copy to my own drive and share that.

2016-09-07T16:43:24 <jhung> colinclark: we got up to the 52 minute mark.
2016-09-07T16:43:28 <colinclark> ok
2016-09-07T16:45:29 <colinclark> Was there much of a discussion about the material last week, jhung?
2016-09-07T16:46:26 <jhung> colinclark: yes there was quite a bit. Maria and alanharnum added their perspectives. We'll start today's community meeting by summarizing last week and some of the discussion points.
2016-09-07T16:46:36 <colinclark> great
