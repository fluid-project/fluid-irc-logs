b"2016-02-08T21:41:04 <Justin_o> colinclark: cool thanks, it's a bit of shame that some of these questions are so singular
2016-02-08T21:41:10 <colinclark> yup
2016-02-08T21:41:20 <colinclark> The ECL's relevance, I think, has faded somewhat in comparison to the early days of large research universities tentatively taking their first steps into open source
2016-02-08T21:42:36 <Justin_o> colinclark: ah i see... there are a lot of good Open Source licenses these days i guess
2016-02-08T21:42:57 <colinclark> well, they're all subtly different

b'2016-02-08T17:13:37 <colinclark> So I started out, in this particular case, using "aconite-all.js"
2016-02-08T17:13:48 <colinclark> which includes a selection portion of Bergson and Flocking in it
2016-02-08T17:13:55 <colinclark> and then my application needed some more of Flocking
2016-02-08T17:14:13 <colinclark> so I looked at finding the appropriate Flocking build
2016-02-08T17:14:19 <Bosmon> Ah
2016-02-08T17:14:24 <Bosmon> Well, that\'s interesting
2016-02-08T17:14:29 <Bosmon> What does "some more of Flocking" mean
2016-02-08T17:14:49 <Bosmon> And doesn\'t this, in terms of our previous discussions, suggest that Flocking would then need to be considered as multiple npm artefacts?
2016-02-08T17:14:57 <colinclark> Well, Aconite only ships the portions of Flocking it requires
2016-02-08T17:15:08 <colinclark> I\'m not sure it\'s an issue of multiple artifacts
2016-02-08T17:15:11 <colinclark> though possibly
2016-02-08T17:15:14 <Bosmon> Or has npm not quite entered the picture here?
2016-02-08T17:15:17 <colinclark> npm has, yes
2016-02-08T17:15:20 <Bosmon> ok
2016-02-08T17:15:49 <Bosmon> One would have to say that "the portions of Flocking that aconite requires" would have to, in the end, be considered as one (or more) npm artefact(s) in themselves
2016-02-08T17:16:16 <Bosmon> I\'m thinking these days that whilst perhaps what we did with GPII universal was "a little mad", it might be a reasonable thing to do after all
2016-02-08T17:16:28 <Bosmon> That is, to have multiple npm artefacts produced by one github artefact
2016-02-08T17:16:48 <Bosmon> We\'ve received yet more confirmation today of how npm\'s constructs are not necessarily completely aligned with github\'s ones : P
2016-02-08T17:16:51 <colinclark> I guess this is flipped
2016-02-08T17:17:03 <colinclark> I mean, let\'s pretend that Aconite is simply a client of Flocking
2016-02-08T17:17:10 <colinclark> not created by the same schmuck
2016-02-08T17:17:11 <jhung> Justin_o: https://github.com/sapegin/grunt-webfont
2016-02-08T17:17:41 <colinclark> Obviously I, as the creator of Flocking, doesn\'t want to take responsibility for each "profile" of Flocking used by my users
2016-02-08T17:18:09 <colinclark> I imagine the issue is really one of arranging for "application-specific builds"
2016-02-08T17:18:35 <colinclark> i.e. I need a way in my application to say "I\'d like you to assemble these portions of Flocking, these portions of Bergson, and these of Aconite"
2016-02-08T17:18:56 <colinclark> but I guess the problem is still, as a user, even knowing or caring which portions of Flocking that Aconite needs
2016-02-08T17:19:04 <colinclark> vs. those that I, as the application developer, need
2016-02-08T17:19:50 <Bosmon> colinclark - but I think, especially with respect to tools such as browserify, "those portions of Flocking, Bergson, etc." that an application needs could only be expressed with respect to names of npm artefacts?
2016-02-08T17:21:07 <colinclark> yes, I suppose that\'s true
2016-02-08T17:21:28 <colinclark> with something that can be require()\'ed somewhere, I assume
2016-02-08T17:21:33 <Bosmon> colinclark - right
2016-02-08T17:21:51 <colinclark> But I guess the key is that in many cases it\'s the client\'s domain to determine a profile of Flocking
2016-02-08T17:21:56 <colinclark> or of Bergson or whatever
2016-02-08T17:22:29 <colinclark> You can see here how Aconite assembles Flocking: https://github.com/colinbdclark/aconite/blob/master/Gruntfile.js#L33-L37
2016-02-08T17:22:52 <Bosmon> colinclark - yes, I see
2016-02-08T17:23:04 <colinclark> And that worked with my current app until I decided--as we all eventually do--that I needed SOME NOISE
2016-02-08T17:23:17 <Bosmon> So does this suggest that "flocking-base", "flocking-oscillators" and "flocking-envelopes" might make sense as npm artefacts?
2016-02-08T17:23:38 <colinclark> perhaps
2016-02-08T17:23:48 <colinclark> but this will become very unruly, I fear
2016-02-08T17:24:02 <colinclark> since, aside from flocking-base, we\'re basically looking at one npm module per file
2016-02-08T17:24:02 <Bosmon> I guess it might
2016-02-08T17:24:12 <Bosmon> I\'m not sure I can see an alternative model
2016-02-08T17:24:12 <colinclark> I recently tried to factor Flocking\'s file structure a bit better
2016-02-08T17:24:17 <colinclark> so that people can more easily pick and choose
2016-02-08T17:24:23 <Bosmon> npm is indeed filled with thousands of one-file modules
2016-02-08T17:24:44 <Bosmon> We could perhaps create some scripts that would just fabricate the packaging automatically
2016-02-08T17:24:48 <Bosmon> As part of a build step
2016-02-08T17:24:52 <Bosmon> That is, the package.json file
2016-02-08T17:25:00 <Bosmon> And the directory
2016-02-08T17:25:06 <colinclark> and then publish them all :P
2016-02-08T17:25:13 <Bosmon> Whose contents would just be fabricated from the base artefact\'s
2016-02-08T17:25:15 <Bosmon> colinclark - yes
2016-02-08T17:25:25 <colinclark> there\'s got to be a better way
2016-02-08T17:25:32 <Bosmon> colinclark - can you think of one?
2016-02-08T17:25:35 <colinclark> no :)
2016-02-08T17:26:10 <Bosmon> It\'s certainly better than playing "guess the path name" with dozens of files
2016-02-08T17:26:22 <Bosmon> And I don\'t think that browserify is going to let us get away with a different model
2016-02-08T17:26:41 <Bosmon> It needs to see "requires" at the granularity of things it is asked to include and exclude
2016-02-08T17:27:55 <colinclark> right
2016-02-08T17:34:00 <Bosmon> Doing this for infusion actually makes the approach feasible
2016-02-08T17:34:12 <Bosmon> I\'ve been absolutely dreading the process of splitting our github project into 20

2016-02-08T19:56:12 <Bosmon> Justin_o, colinclark - I\'ve lifted a paragraph from an email from Mike Skirpan from last year onto the GSoC 2016 brainstorming page:
2016-02-08T19:56:13 <Bosmon> https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/GSoC+2016+Project+Ideas+-+Brainstorming
2016-02-08T19:56:19 <Bosmon> It looks like he\'s interested in working with us this year
2016-02-08T19:57:33 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks, would you mind shepherding that into a project description on this page https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Google+Summer+of+Code+2016+with+the+Fluid+Project
2016-02-08T19:57:39 <Bosmon> Ah, thanks Justin_o
2016-02-08T19:57:44 <Justin_o> Bosmon: also would you be interested in mentoring that one?
2016-02-08T19:57:48 * alanharnum joined the channel
2016-02-08T19:57:55 <Bosmon> Justin_o, yes, I can mentor that one
2016-02-08T19:58:58 <Justin_o> Bosmon: great thanks..
2016-02-08T19:59:04 <Justin_o> i\'m actually applying for GSoC as we speak

2016-02-08T19:59:18 <Bosmon> Justin_o - awesome

2016-02-08T20:11:00 <Justin_o> Bosmon:  me too, i believe we missed out last year because they were opening up spots for new orgs.
2016-02-08T20:17:57 * the-t-in-rtf has quit
2016-02-08T20:18:33 <Justin_o> colinclark, simonjb, alanharnum, michelled, avtar, cindyli: are you intersted in mentoring GSoC Projects this year?
2016-02-08T20:18:44 <colinclark> Justin_o: I am, yes
2016-02-08T20:19:02 <colinclark> Once again, I\'d love to try to attract a student to work on a project at the threshold between inclusive design and creative practice
2016-02-08T20:19:24 <alanharnum> Justin_o: I could (somewhat dependent on the project)
2016-02-08T20:19:40 <alanharnum> i think that would be really cool, colinclark
2016-02-08T20:20:09 <colinclark> we should consider doing two, alanharnum
2016-02-08T20:20:18 <colinclark> one perhaps related again to accessible web instruments
2016-02-08T20:20:37 <colinclark> perhaps another related to sonification or to live coding or to something cool like sonifying videos
2016-02-08T20:20:46 <Justin_o> alanharnum: you can pick the project you want to lead :)
2016-02-08T20:21:02 <michelled> simonjb: perhaps a third related to electronics
2016-02-08T20:21:42 <Justin_o> colinclark: sounds cool
2016-02-08T20:22:01 <Justin_o> colinclark: could you write up a description on the wiki page https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Google+Summer+of+Code+2016+with+the+Fluid+Project
2016-02-08T20:22:02 <michelled> Justin_o: I would be interested. I need to think about what
2016-02-08T20:22:09 <colinclark> yes, for sure, Justin_o
2016-02-08T20:22:25 <Justin_o> michelled: great thanks
2016-02-08T20:22:51 <Justin_o> michelled, simonjb: the electronics one might be hard if we don\'t send the student the equipment... if we can do that it should be okay i guess
2016-02-08T20:27:49 <cindyli> Justin_o: can you review the pull request i just issued for fixing a linting error - https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/667
2016-02-08T20:28:01 <cindyli> in the infusion master
2016-02-08T20:32:27 <Justin_o> cindyli: if you have a few minutes could you look into Antonio\'s issue from the infusion-users list
2016-02-08T20:32:42 <Justin_o> he\'s having some trouble getting the text-to-speech panel showing up in his implementation
2016-02-08T20:32:48 <cindyli> sure, Justin_o
2016-02-08T20:43:18 <jhung> michelled: ping
2016-02-08T20:50:31 <michelled> jhung: I\'m in a meeting that will end in a few minutes
2016-02-08T20:50:38 <jhung> ok

2016-02-08T21:28:00 <michelled> are you still working for a while?
2016-02-08T21:28:49 <jhung> Yep I\'m still around michelled
2016-02-08T21:28:54 <jhung> Have time now?
2016-02-08T21:29:37 <michelled> yes, but need a couple minutes first :)
2016-02-08T21:29:47 <jhung> ok no prob michelled
2016-02-08T21:32:57 <Justin_o> jhung: do you know if we have an IDI logo that meets these requirements: 24-bit PNG, minimum height 256 pixels
2016-02-08T21:33:27 <jhung> If not we can make one Justin_o.
2016-02-08T21:34:18 <jhung> This one should work Justin_o: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/IDI+Logo?preview=/24941483/40927273/logo_large_idi_vertical.png
2016-02-08T21:38:17 <michelled> jhung: call when you are ready
2016-02-08T21:38:20 <Justin_o> jhung: thanks, that worked
2016-02-08T21:39:08 <Justin_o> colinclark: i take it that our primary License is BSD-3 is that correct?
2016-02-08T21:40:07 <colinclark> I guess there is no real concept of "primary" license, at least when it comes to Infusion
2016-02-08T21:40:15 <colinclark> since there are two, and they are just there
2016-02-08T21:40:29 <Justin_o> colinclark: yah, it\'s another GSoC question
2016-02-08T21:40:29 <colinclark> but yes, I prefer to consider that the 3-clause BSD license is our primary one
2016-02-08T21:40:32 <colinclark> totally
2016-02-08T21:40:38 <colinclark> ECL just isn\'t widely used
