b"2016-03-07T21:44:07 <gtirloni> simonjb: i was thinking about it while reading more about the performance of unix sockets and JS, and linking to the selinux work
2016-03-07T21:45:45 <simonjb> gtirloni: yeah, there is serialization in the response and deserialization in the request processing -- we send JSON in the requests
2016-03-07T21:46:26 <simonjb> JSON in both requests and responses
2016-03-07T21:46:53 <simonjb> which is converted to and from JavaScript objects in the Nexus node process
2016-03-07T21:46:54 <gtirloni> got it, ok so the serialization is built-in and wouldn't be a problem with a communicating process
2016-03-07T21:47:29 <simonjb> gtirloni: can you expand on that last statement?
2016-03-07T21:48:28 <gtirloni> in this hypothetical scenario, i'm assuming the process taking the requests would have to serialize the object, send it over through the unix socket so the receiving process can deserialize it
2016-03-07T21:49:01 <gtirloni> i was going to check how Chrome works with its helper processes and selinux but didn't get aroudn to it
2016-03-07T21:49:12 <simonjb> ok, interesting
2016-03-07T21:50:20 <gtirloni> so my initial question was so because i thought maybe there would be an additional performance impact if i was goign to propose serialization, but i obviously missed it's needed for the html requests anyway
2016-03-07T21:52:00 <simonjb> yeah, there's serialization in the request processing and response building
2016-03-07T21:53:19 <gtirloni> ok, i think more about this and how it would in practice with selinux and will bother you later on :P

2016-03-07T22:34:12 <danayo> hi akshay
2016-03-07T22:36:04 <danayo> akshay: are you familiar with Infusion and the Preferences framework in particular http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/PreferencesFramework.html ?
2016-03-07T22:36:15 <danayo> the goal of this project is to make a fun interactive experience for informing a user of setting preferences. The First Discovery Tool is another example of a tool that brings a user into the process of setting their preferences, but it is structured more as a wizard than an interactive. Hopefully it will help you get the idea. http://build.fluidproject.org/first-discovery/demos/
2016-03-07T22:37:23 <danayo> You can also look around at the other demos for UI Options and the Preferences Framework on http://build.fluidproject.org
2016-03-07T22:37:29 <danayo> sounds like you have some good ideas akshay
2016-03-07T22:37:53 <danayo> As you go through the documentation, source code, demos, and the current design mock up you should start to think of how you\xe2\x80\x99ll approach the project, what the user experience should be, what technologies are needed, how to make it accessible, and etc.

2016-03-07T17:20:27 <dins> it\'s ok
2016-03-07T17:20:47 <Justin_o> dins: that should be fine, but you should work that out specifically with your mentor
2016-03-07T17:20:47 <dins> can I know whether it\'s possible?
2016-03-07T17:21:02 <dins> ok
2016-03-07T17:22:56 <dins> Hi michelled1, I\'m trying for "Accessible music controllers" project
2016-03-07T17:23:07 <Justin_o> nrda: could you mention that as a comment on the pull request and put a link to the old pull request as well.
2016-03-07T17:23:41 <Justin_o> nrda: also the name of the old pull request was probably better than the new one.
2016-03-07T17:23:49 <dins> so, hope we have free to select what ever the library to do it.
2016-03-07T17:23:53 <dins> is it?
2016-03-07T17:24:15 <Justin_o> nrda: it\'s good to name the pull request with the Issue number at the beginning
2016-03-07T17:24:17 <michelled1> hi dins, what library were you thinking ok?
2016-03-07T17:24:23 <michelled1> thinking of :)
2016-03-07T17:25:37 <dins> actually, I though of using only jquery. because, if we get involved more libraries, there are lots of unwanted things as well
2016-03-07T17:26:26 <nrda> ok justin_o
2016-03-07T17:26:34 <dins> but also I thought of comming up with a plane of both SVG and html

2016-03-07T18:09:05 <dins> yes
2016-03-07T18:09:33 <dins> I started with that
2016-03-07T18:09:43 <dins> by now it\'s almost completed
2016-03-07T18:10:32 <dins> it\'s basically a ring, where the value is displayed in the middle
2016-03-07T18:10:47 <dins> and value can be controlled by keyboard
2016-03-07T18:10:49 <michelled1> cool, is there somewhere we can see it?
2016-03-07T18:10:58 <dins> yeah
2016-03-07T18:11:03 <dins> nexux UI
2016-03-07T18:11:26 <michelled1> do you have a link?
2016-03-07T18:11:59 <dins> http://nexusosc.com/
2016-03-07T18:12:33 <dins> the difference in this is, this is developed more using html and a bit of svg
2016-03-07T18:12:56 <dins> with a very responcive and accessible way
2016-03-07T18:13:03 <dins> that how it is there
2016-03-07T18:13:26 <dins> I think most of the every controller is there in http://nexusosc.com/
2016-03-07T18:13:38 <dins> but, they are canvas implementations
2016-03-07T18:13:51 <dins> :)
2016-03-07T18:15:06 <michelled1> dins, I was actually asking for  a link to what you have built
2016-03-07T18:15:36 <dins> sorry, I havent uploaded it anywhere yet
2016-03-07T18:15:54 <dins> shall I email it to you
2016-03-07T18:16:07 <michelled1> no, I\'d rather use more open methods of sharing
2016-03-07T18:16:11 <michelled1> a github repo would be great
2016-03-07T18:16:18 <dins> yeah
2016-03-07T18:16:23 <michelled1> that way simonjb and other people can see it too
2016-03-07T18:16:39 <dins> I\'l share that and put the link here

2016-03-07T18:32:02 <michelled1> hi akshay, welcome
2016-03-07T18:33:19 <akshay> Actually I\'m really interested since I have developed similar games for an NPO for which I worked for the previous summer.

2016-03-07T18:41:20 <akshay> So I can use the same alongwith the Preference framework to make an HTML 5 game based on your idea of \'First Discovery of Preferences\' which can be further deployed as a web or wrapped as an hybrid app and published to various app stores.

2016-03-07T19:02:17 <akshay> My ultimate aim would be design the game with really descent UI/UX and unique gameplay and make a code base that can be used to target multiple platforms
2016-03-07T19:03:49 <akshay> and having a proper documentation that makes the work of future developers hassle free.

2016-03-07T21:39:01 <simonjb> gtirloni: there is serialization in that objects within the Nexus node vm are sent as JSON in HTTP responses
2016-03-07T21:39:13 <simonjb> what did you have in mind?

2016-03-07T04:57:43 <dins> @nrda , in order to preview demos, you need to point them to a server
2016-03-07T04:58:48 <dins> as an example, using node js....................  go to the infusion folder through command line and run http-server
2016-03-07T04:59:33 <dins> then it will serve that folder pointed to localhost:8081
2016-03-07T05:00:13 <dins> (make sure u have installed http-server as a global npm package)
2016-03-07T05:01:04 <dins> http://localhost:8081/demos/uploader/    this will give you the expected output what you are refering

2016-03-07T14:27:21 <Justin_o> gtirloni: no problem, we tend to mentor as a community so that should be fine. Feel free to refer to others as needed. You\'d have to be on top of selecting a student, filling out the evaluations, checking in with the student and making sure they are receiving the guidance and mentorship required, and etc.

2016-03-07T14:55:09 <sakshamsaxena> Yes well that was my first choice. It says sometimes that it isn\'t available. Dunno. But yeah "sakshamsaxena" and "Saksham_" both refers to me.

2016-03-07T15:08:00 <avtar> i\'m making some changes so that you can specify a github token (this ended up being a requirement, 60 reqs/hour wasn\'t enough for large results) when provisioning the vm and some rough docs
2016-03-07T15:08:26 <avtar> i\'ll push everything to a repo once i\'m done

2016-03-07T15:10:05 <amanvar> I am new in this org can anyone tell me how do I start working on this project "Game for First Discovery of Preferences".
2016-03-07T15:13:52 * MarianAlex joined the channel
2016-03-07T15:16:46 <MarianAlex> Hello everyone, it is nice to meet you all!
2016-03-07T15:17:11 <MarianAlex> Regarding "Game for First Discovery of Preferences", looking at the demo with cats, the first question that is coming in my mind is: this will be a 2D or 3D game?
2016-03-07T15:17:16 <MarianAlex> Secondly, the current question at one given step in the game is related to the previous? For example, choosing one option at current step will affect what is the next question?
2016-03-07T15:17:22 <MarianAlex> Will be any AI algorithm involved or the questions will always be the same (until someone changes them from database)?

2016-03-07T15:36:35 <danayo> hi amanvar,  I\xe2\x80\x99d suggest that you start by becoming familiar with Infusion and the Preferences framework in particular. http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/PreferencesFramework.html
2016-03-07T15:37:18 <danayo> amanvar: the goal of this project is to make a fun interactive experience for informing a user of setting preferences. The First Discovery Tool is another example of a tool that brings a user into the process of setting their preferences, but it is structured more as a wizard than an interactive. Hopefully it will help you get the idea. http://build.fluidproject.org/first-discovery/demos/
2016-03-07T15:37:35 <danayo> You can also look around at the other demos for UI Options and the Preferences Framework on http://build.fluidproject.org
2016-03-07T15:38:02 <danayo> amanvar: As you go through the documentation, source code, demos, and the current design mock up you should start to think of how you\xe2\x80\x99ll approach the project, what the user experience should be, what technologies are needed, how to make it accessible, and etc.
2016-03-07T15:40:57 <amanvar> Thanks danayo. I will look into that.
2016-03-07T15:42:42 <Justin_o> gtirloni: i\'ve come across a few JIRAs now where the screenshots aren\'t showing up. like this one https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-4728
2016-03-07T15:42:44 <Justin_o> any idea?

2016-03-07T15:44:59 <gtirloni> Justin_o: when moving it to a new server i noticed it had had many different configs and locations for attachments. since this is from 2012, my guess is the attachment got lost. in the migration i did, i merged 3 different attachment locations to fix most of these issues.. but it didn\'t fix 100% of the issues
2016-03-07T15:50:00 <Justin_o> gtirloni: so if the attachment is missing, it\'s gone for good?
2016-03-07T15:50:14 <gtirloni> hard to say without diving into the backups from that era
2016-03-07T15:50:39 <gtirloni> if it\'s necessary in this case, could you open a JIRA in the INFRA project?
2016-03-07T15:50:45 <Justin_o> gtirloni: okay.. as I have time, i\'ll try to create new screenshots for ones i find are missing
2016-03-07T15:50:59 <gtirloni> ok
2016-03-07T15:51:40 * ioan_ joined the channel
2016-03-07T15:51:52 <Justin_o> gtirloni: do you know if there is a way to identify all of the JIRAs with dead attachments, quickly.
2016-03-07T15:51:53 <Justin_o> ?
2016-03-07T15:54:28 <gtirloni> not sure, i\'d have to check
2016-03-07T15:56:13 <Justin_o> gtirloni: okay, for now i\'ll just make the changes as they come up
2016-03-07T15:56:54 * ioan_ has quit
2016-03-07T15:56:54 <gtirloni> ok, please let me know if you see an big number of missing attachments so i can prioritize properly
2016-03-07T15:57:05 <Justin_o> gtirloni: will do, thanks
