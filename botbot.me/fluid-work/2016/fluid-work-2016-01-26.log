2016-01-26T15:01:38 <anastasiac> k
2016-01-26T15:02:25 <Justin_o> Bosmon2, Bosmon7: did you see the comment i left in the channel for you yesterday?
2016-01-26T15:02:56 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - I didn\'t, sorry
2016-01-26T15:03:30 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: no worries, https://botbot.me/freenode/fluid-work/2016-01-25/?msg=58640219&page=1
2016-01-26T15:03:49 <Justin_o> it\'s about the unit tests i was trying to write for tooltip
2016-01-26T15:04:11 <danayo> Justin_o, anastasiac, michelled: PGA meeting now?
2016-01-26T15:04:22 <anastasiac> right
2016-01-26T15:05:13 <Justin_o> danayo: thanks
2016-01-26T15:09:14 <Bosmon7> So yes, Justin_o - the way that we do this in the prefs framework is obsolete
2016-01-26T15:09:20 <Bosmon7> So there\'s no need to replicate it in your tests
2016-01-26T15:09:39 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: okay cool, can you send me what is now the best practices
2016-01-26T15:09:49 <Bosmon7> I\'m referring particularly to the scheme for using multiple jQueries
2016-01-26T15:10:00 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: yep
2016-01-26T15:10:02 <Bosmon7> You can just use the standard jQuery and qualify the selector search by passing it the iframe window
2016-01-26T15:10:31 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: oh, so something like $("someSelector", iframeWindow);
2016-01-26T15:10:34 <Justin_o> like that?
2016-01-26T15:10:51 <Justin_o> is there a way to do that with the selectors block in a component?
2016-01-26T15:11:15 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - well it should just happen automatically if the "container" for the component is already inside the iframe (or is the iframe)
2016-01-26T15:11:31 <Justin_o> ah okay

2016-01-26T16:04:36 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: okay, other than that did you see any reason why the onCreate should be happening twice?
2016-01-26T16:04:48 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - I didn\'t
2016-01-26T16:04:56 <Bosmon7> But I couldn\'t get your tests to run in order to find out why
2016-01-26T16:04:56 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: hmm :(
2016-01-26T16:05:04 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: oh really, that\'s strange
2016-01-26T16:05:04 <Bosmon7> If you can fix them up, I can take another look
2016-01-26T16:05:35 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: okay, i\'ll try again.. got some work to do for PGA now though, so i might be a bit, but i\'ll try to squeeze it in at some point
2016-01-26T16:05:42 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - cool
2016-01-26T16:05:48 <Bosmon7> What are you up to for PGA?
2016-01-26T16:06:41 <Justin_o> writing test plans and doing cross platform testing
2016-01-26T16:08:20 <Bosmon7> awesome
2016-01-26T16:09:27 <Justin_o> Bosmon7:  :)
2016-01-26T16:09:35 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: do you know if kaspser is around these days?
2016-01-26T16:11:14 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - he is around in general
2016-01-26T16:11:19 <Bosmon7> Although he has now gone onto 50% time
2016-01-26T16:11:47 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: ah, if i\'m pointing the IBM folks at someone regarding GPII questions is Kasper still the best for that?
2016-01-26T16:12:06 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - in general, yes
2016-01-26T16:12:26 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: okay, and what\'s the best GPII mailing list to use for questions about getting preferences working
2016-01-26T16:12:43 <Bosmon7> Depends on what you mean by "getting preferences working" : P
2016-01-26T16:12:53 <Bosmon7> The GPII architecture list is the main working list that we use
2016-01-26T16:13:23 <Justin_o> basically taking the preferences from the FD Tool and having GPII apply them
2016-01-26T16:13:38 <Bosmon7> apply them to what?
2016-01-26T16:13:52 <Justin_o> An OS
2016-01-26T16:14:01 <Justin_o> probably windows 7, 8, 10
2016-01-26T16:14:32 <Bosmon7> ok
2016-01-26T16:14:45 <Bosmon7> That\'s mostly a matter of just telling the GPII which preferences server to use
2016-01-26T16:15:07 <Bosmon7> Which, given it is using the "Kettle config" system should be relatively familiar
2016-01-26T16:15:41 <Bosmon7> Although it might be an easier ride doing this with my GPII-1318 branch rather than current trunk
2016-01-26T16:16:12 <Bosmon7> But pinging Kasper on the mailing list would be useful in general
2016-01-26T16:17:03 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: cool thanks, i\'ll make that suggestion.

2016-01-26T16:52:05 <anastasiac> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/pull/80
2016-01-26T17:02:46 <Justin_o> anastasiac: okay thanks
2016-01-26T17:04:22 <michelled> alanharnum: I suggest that you start working in other branches that branch off the one that you have the pull for
2016-01-26T17:04:30 <michelled> so you can still work incrementally
2016-01-26T17:05:02 <alanharnum> michelled: yeah, i\'m going to make a PR for the current work, then will create issues and new branches as needed
2016-01-26T17:05:43 <alanharnum> i also have a bunch of non-code writing to do for all this that i really should put my hand to, or i\'ll end up doing it at the last minute
2016-01-26T17:17:58 <michelled> sounds great alanharnum
2016-01-26T17:19:03 <alanharnum> michelled: PR opened https://github.com/fluid-project/chartAuthoring/pull/11
2016-01-26T17:27:28 <Justin_o> anastasiac: did you see these two comments i had left on the pull request? https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/pull/80#discussion_r50844226 and https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/pull/80#issuecomment-175059960
2016-01-26T17:29:25 <anastasiac> ah, I missed a couple, sorry Justin_o
2016-01-26T17:29:32 <Justin_o> np
2016-01-26T17:36:09 <alanharnum> anastasiac (or someone else knowledgeable about the inlineEdit component), any idea why I\'d be seeing this behaviour? https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLOE-448
2016-01-26T17:36:15 * danayo has quit
2016-01-26T17:37:55 <anastasiac> alanharnum: do you have a link I could test it out on? can\xe2\x80\x99t reproduce on current build site
2016-01-26T17:38:13 <alanharnum> anastasiac: https://rawgit.com/waharnum/chartAuthoring/FLOE-437/demos/index.html
2016-01-26T17:39:56 <alanharnum> there seems to be something going on that causes them to return to the default text under circumstances i don\'t quite understand
2016-01-26T17:41:05 <anastasiac> alanharnum: where is the inlineedit instantiated?
2016-01-26T17:42:10 <alanharnum> anastasiac: two of them starting at https://github.com/waharnum/chartAuthoring/blob/FLOE-437/src/js/chartAuthoring.js#L57, as subcomponents of the overall chartAuthoringInterface
2016-01-26T17:44:16 <anastasiac> alanharnum: your branch adds the listeners, so I\xe2\x80\x99d start by following the trail of what they\xe2\x80\x99re doing
2016-01-26T17:45:22 <alanharnum> anastastiac: think the listeners could be causing some kind of unwarranted bidirectional behaviour or similar?
2016-01-26T17:45:47 <anastasiac> possibly. they\xe2\x80\x99re updating the model; is that model possibly already tied to something, via a relay, or something?
2016-01-26T17:46:16 <anastasiac> I\xe2\x80\x99m not familiar with the code, but those listeners are a big difference
2016-01-26T17:46:29 <anastasiac> you could try removing one of them, alanharnum, and see if the problem goes away
2016-01-26T17:46:39 <anastasiac> that would tell whether or not I\xe2\x80\x99m barkign up the wrong tree
2016-01-26T17:46:46 <anastasiac> at least
2016-01-26T17:47:44 <anastasiac> alanharnum: another very vague possibility: your listeners are displacing the default listeners within the inline edit?
2016-01-26T17:48:24 <anastasiac> they shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t but the framework has changed a lot since inline edit was written
2016-01-26T17:48:31 <anastasiac> could be something was missed
2016-01-26T17:49:03 <alanharnum> anastasiac: it seems to be the same behaviour with the listeners removed but something about the listener behaviour would make sense
2016-01-26T17:49:34 <alanharnum> i\'ll try the inlineedit component separately in isolation, with the version of Infusing I\'m using here, and see if the behaviour changes

2016-01-26T19:44:24 <Justin_o> anastasiac: thanks, i have it on my list of things to look at

2016-01-26T20:03:07 <alanharnum> anastaciac: finally tracked it down to a leftover model relay issue from an earlier attempt at connecting the inlinedit components to other models, which i\'d forgotten to remove from the component definition after i realized it wouldn\'t work :p
2016-01-26T20:03:40 <alanharnum> turns out it was working, but only in the wrong direction (overwriting the inlineedit model changes or something similar)

2016-01-26T20:12:20 <cindyli> alanharnum: what browsers does the sound play in the chart authoring tool support? from what i tried, the sound plays ok in chrome but not in firefox
2016-01-26T20:13:02 <alanharnum> cindyli: at the moment it only works in Chrome and Safari because it relies on browser voice synthesis
2016-01-26T20:13:11 <cindyli> very cool to hear those sounds!
2016-01-26T20:13:18 <alanharnum> yeah it\'s pretty neat
2016-01-26T20:13:21 <cindyli> good to know. thanks, alanharnum
2016-01-26T20:15:14 <alanharnum> more precisely on the Firefox issue, it can play the sounds themselves (though not the voice labels), but at the moment the overall scheduler logic relies on the voice synthesis
