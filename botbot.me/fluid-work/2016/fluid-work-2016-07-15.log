2016-07-15T13:59:35 <wannabeCitizen> Hey folks, so I\xe2\x80\x99m getting this error: ASSERTION FAILED:  Cannot parse modelRelay record without element "singleTransform" or "transform"
2016-07-15T14:00:43 <wannabeCitizen> But in the infusion docs it does not say singleTransform or transform is required. Is this an error in the docs or am I missing something?

2016-07-15T14:11:10 <jhernandez> FYI, I\'ve just pushed the first stub on the extension\'s browser-based tests
2016-07-15T14:11:41 * PaliwalSparsh1 joined the channel
2016-07-15T14:12:27 <jhernandez> I\'m having some difficulties when running some of them, and I\'d appreciate some help
2016-07-15T14:13:17 <Justin_o> jhernandez: hello
2016-07-15T14:13:39 <Justin_o> jhernandez: what can i do to help?
2016-07-15T14:14:53 * PaliwalSparsh has quit
2016-07-15T14:15:42 <jhernandez> well, can we meet at some point today/next week? I have some doubts/questions regarding web-based testing with infusion
2016-07-15T14:15:44 * michelled has quit
2016-07-15T14:17:00 <Justin_o> jhernandez: i\'ll be online for only the next couple hours today. i\'m off on Monday and Tuesday. We have some guests coming to the office next week, so I\'m not yet exactly sure what my availability will be for Wed - Fri but should be able to make some time here and there.
2016-07-15T14:17:53 * michelled joined the channel
2016-07-15T14:18:17 <jhernandez> Justin_o: ok, no prob, we can talk during the week and see if we can make it
2016-07-15T14:18:40 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh1: do you have a link to the game that we could share with some other people. It doesn\'t have to be complete, but i guess something that showcases what you have so far... if you don\'t have anything right now, could you send a link to Dana on Monday.
2016-07-15T14:19:15 <Justin_o> jhernandez: cool.. please ping me again on Wednesday then and we can try to work something out.
2016-07-15T14:19:25 <jhernandez> Justin_o: sure, thanks!
2016-07-15T14:21:08 <jhernandez> in any case, I\'m not bored, I\'ve got plenty of things to do in there - ie, notifications are almost ready :)
2016-07-15T14:21:44 <PaliwalSparsh1> Hi Justin_o, surely I will do this, I was about to ask about it only as you also mentioned it in the mail. I will do it Monday. Thankyou.
2016-07-15T14:23:23 <Justin_o> jhernandez: that\'s cool, you\'re making good progress :)

2016-07-15T15:26:03 <bens_> hi avtar, wondering if you could help me learn a bit about the windows build status at ci.gpii.net?
2016-07-15T15:28:19 <bens_> what i\'m trying to do is compare my run of unit tests in my vagrant vm w/ the build server. i\'m getting errors and wanted to check if it is just my issue or not

2016-07-15T15:35:40 * PaliwalSparsh1 joined the channel
2016-07-15T15:38:06 <bens_> avtar, i think what i\'m looking for would be here: https://ci.gpii.net/job/windows-unit-tests/lastBuild/console - but that is not available. it seems the windows agents are offline
2016-07-15T15:41:08 * styki has quit
2016-07-15T15:44:16 <avtar> bens_: the windows agent comes online only for brief periods when needed for ci jobs and then rides off into the sunset
2016-07-15T15:44:53 * michelled joined the channel
2016-07-15T15:45:02 <avtar> you can find logs of previous failures in the ci mailing list archives http://lists.gpii.net/pipermail/ci/
2016-07-15T15:45:36 <avtar> http://lists.gpii.net/pipermail/ci/2016-July/000123.html
2016-07-15T15:49:20 <bens_> avtar, anyway to know what version of code was used for the messages in the archives?
2016-07-15T15:50:13 <bens_> and these are only failures, not successful runs?
2016-07-15T15:52:51 <avtar> bens_: correct, only failures are reported to that list

2016-07-15T17:51:05 <bens_> hi avtar, does the CI system run the windows acceptance tests? I\'m getting  a failure related to JAWS locally. Looks like it is this issue: https://botbot.me/freenode/fluid-work/2014-12-10/?msg=27265498&page=3. I don\'t see similar errors in the ci mailing list so I am wondering if maybe the CI system runs something other than "node tests\\AcceptanceTests.js"

2016-07-15T19:15:01 <bens_> hi avtar i think i\'m all set now. a lot of the questions I have found answered in the ci-service repo code
2016-07-15T19:15:12 <avtar> awesome
2016-07-15T19:15:45 <bens_> i\'m basically just trying to do locally what would happen w/ a PR.. so reading that repo tells me exactly that
2016-07-15T19:16:11 * PaliwalSparsh1 joined the channel
2016-07-15T19:17:14 <avtar> i\'m hoping to include those bits in the respective repositories themselves soon so people won\'t need to go hunting for details in that separate ci-service repository
