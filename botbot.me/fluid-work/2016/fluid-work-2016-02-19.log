2016-02-19T16:23:11 <jtworkme> Justin_o: Huh, the native host should echo the original message and add a "is_successful" value to the original json.

2016-02-19T12:30:25 <kasparnet> hey simon
2016-02-19T12:30:31 <kasparnet> simonjb: *
2016-02-19T12:30:38 <simonjb> kasparnet: did you need me to look at diagrams?
2016-02-19T12:30:48 <simonjb> we are finishing the P4A meetings now
2016-02-19T12:30:53 <kasparnet> ah cool
2016-02-19T12:30:58 <kasparnet> how did everything go?
2016-02-19T12:31:04 <simonjb> good I think
2016-02-19T12:31:07 <kasparnet> cool
2016-02-19T12:31:18 <kasparnet> they\'re out talking about it now?
2016-02-19T12:31:40 <kasparnet> simonjb: it turns out we have until next wednesday to finish up the diagrams
2016-02-19T12:31:45 <kasparnet> so there is less stress with it
2016-02-19T12:31:50 <simonjb> it\'s a face-2-face meeting for us -- not the review
2016-02-19T12:31:55 <kasparnet> ahhh
2016-02-19T12:32:04 <simonjb> the review is in a couple of months I think
2016-02-19T12:32:25 <kasparnet> haha shit, yeah ok
2016-02-19T12:32:41 <kasparnet> well, good to hear it went well, either way
2016-02-19T12:32:52 <simonjb> so maybe I can have a look at diagrams next week?
2016-02-19T12:33:23 <simonjb> kasparnet ^
2016-02-19T12:34:03 <kasparnet> yeah, that\'d be great! will you be working monday?
2016-02-19T12:34:14 <kasparnet> or will you take that off from the travel/jetlag?
2016-02-19T12:34:17 <simonjb> I\'m not sure yet
2016-02-19T12:34:28 <simonjb> I fly back on Sunday
2016-02-19T12:34:45 <kasparnet> yeah - then you\'re probably gonna be pretty destroyed on monday
2016-02-19T12:35:03 <simonjb> if I took Monday off, would Tuesday be too late?
2016-02-19T12:35:18 <kasparnet> in either case, I have the diagrams for the current architecture here: If you feel https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0ByfE6R0ipKCjQjQzMkpfd3ctTzA - in the current folder
2016-02-19T12:35:28 <simonjb> ok, thanks
2016-02-19T12:36:48 <kasparnet> I guess the security aspects are now limited to the "Base Diagram"
2016-02-19T12:36:54 <simonjb> ok
2016-02-19T12:37:52 <kasparnet> simonjb: wrt Monday - that\'s a non-APCP day for me as well, so looking at it/talking about it tuesday is ok for me as well
2016-02-19T12:38:08 <simonjb> good to know, thanks kasparnet
2016-02-19T12:38:24 <simonjb> I\'ll see how it goes on Monday
2016-02-19T12:38:29 * jhung joined the channel
2016-02-19T12:38:37 <kasparnet> cool
2016-02-19T12:38:45 * jhernandez joined the channel
2016-02-19T12:40:15 <kasparnet> simonjb: just for the record - I\'ve also created an updated preferences server diagram for "planned" (ie. system at the end of APCP) which involves security. The idea would be to references this diagram for any consumer of the preferences server (incl. flowmanagers, preferences editors, etc)
2016-02-19T12:41:04 <kasparnet> (the file planned/preferencesServer-sequence.png, that is)
2016-02-19T12:41:48 <kasparnet> finally, we got a meeting about the architecture diagrams at 15:00 if you\'re up for it and interested! And indeed only if you feel up for it (and interested)
2016-02-19T12:41:56 <kasparnet> simonjb: ^
2016-02-19T12:42:06 <kasparnet> ... and NOW I\'ll stop spamming the channel

2016-02-19T13:28:25 * simonjb joined the channel
2016-02-19T13:34:20 <simonjb> kasparnet: will you be meeting on vidyo at 15:00? I\'ll try and join but it\'s possible I might not be able to due to ports being blocked
2016-02-19T13:34:31 <kasparnet> hey simonjb
2016-02-19T13:34:46 <kasparnet> yeah, probably
2016-02-19T13:34:54 <simonjb> ok
2016-02-19T13:34:56 <kasparnet> so - yes, it will be at 15:00
2016-02-19T13:35:10 <kasparnet> and if you\'re there but unable to join, we\'ll shift it to something else

2016-02-19T14:06:26 <colinclark> yup, just give me one sec
2016-02-19T14:22:20 <kasparnet> gtirloni: We\'re meeting about the diagrams if you\'re available
2016-02-19T14:22:30 <gtirloni> kasparnet: ok, joining
2016-02-19T14:22:36 <kasparnet> my room
2016-02-19T14:30:49 <Justin_o> jtworkme: hello
2016-02-19T14:31:17 <Justin_o> thanks for sending me the instructions for testing the native host and chrome extension
2016-02-19T14:31:32 <Justin_o> there\'s definitely something wrong with my install.
2016-02-19T14:31:34 <Justin_o> getting this error
2016-02-19T14:31:44 <Justin_o> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/zo3jvLkU/
2016-02-19T14:32:53 <Justin_o> jtworkme: also i notice in your e-mail you say "Additionally, look in C:\\Program Files (x86)\\First-Discovery-Chrome-Extension for appropriate files (python-host and python-host.bat)"
2016-02-19T14:33:28 <Justin_o> As i mentioned in the google sheet it didn\'t install to this location for me, but rather C:\\First-Discovery-Chrome-Extension
2016-02-19T14:33:38 <Justin_o> i have to see if the registry key was added still
2016-02-19T14:34:54 <jtworkme> odd. I\'ll look into it now
2016-02-19T14:36:10 <Justin_o> could this have something to do with the fact that my VM is 32-bit?
2016-02-19T14:36:52 <jtworkme> Bingo
2016-02-19T14:37:08 * jhernandez has quit
2016-02-19T14:37:58 <jtworkme> you don\'t have \\Program Files(x86), it would just make the install at the root of C:\\
2016-02-19T14:37:58 * jhernandez joined the channel
2016-02-19T14:38:40 <Justin_o> jtworkme: make sense... should it still work from that directory or is there something specifically looking into "Program Files(x86)"?

2016-02-19T14:48:19 <jtworkme> The registry value for HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Google\\Chrome\\NativeMessagingHosts\\com.ibm.firstdiscovery contains the path to python-host
2016-02-19T14:48:46 <jtworkme> there is a variable in the install-host.bat that sets that path.
2016-02-19T14:48:47 * yzen_ is now known as yzen
2016-02-19T14:49:28 <jtworkme> I\'d like to know what the value of HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Google\\Chrome\\NativeMessagingHosts\\com.ibm.firstdiscovery is for you
2016-02-19T14:51:08 <Justin_o> jtworkme: it\'s \\First-Discovery-Chrome-Extension\\com.ibm.firstdiscovery.json
2016-02-19T14:52:06 <jtworkme> okay there\'s the problem. We didn\'t count on people not having \\Program Files (x86) so the install path isn\'t being built properly
2016-02-19T14:54:16 <Justin_o> jtworkme: okay, so \\Program Files (x86) is assumed to be the root of that path
2016-02-19T14:56:29 * Bosmon8 has quit
2016-02-19T14:56:43 <jtworkme> yes. If that dir doesn\'t exist, "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\" doesn\'t get prepended

2016-02-19T14:59:16 <Justin_o> great, thanks
2016-02-19T14:59:30 <jtworkme> no problem, I\'ll msg you when I push it
2016-02-19T14:59:41 <Justin_o> jtworkme: by the way, do you mind if post the contents of your  e-mail to the test plan.
2016-02-19T14:59:45 <Justin_o> jhernandez: thanks
2016-02-19T15:01:01 <jtworkme> Justin_o: not at all

2016-02-19T15:53:31 <colinclark> Give the students some impression of what kinds of things they will be required to do, concretely
2016-02-19T15:54:13 <colinclark> You get the key point with "all sizes," but maybe there\'s a way to talk about what some of the kinds of tasks or work looks like
