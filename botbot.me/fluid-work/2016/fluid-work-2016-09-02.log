b'2016-09-02T22:37:59 <avtar> and with that i bid you adieu
2016-09-02T22:38:10 <gloob> adios
2016-09-02T22:38:42 <avtar> auf wiedersehen
2016-09-02T23:38:37 * stegru has quit
'

b'2016-09-02T20:27:58 <alanharnum2> there\'s an area on the screen of the orientation demo that\'s supposed to drop in the sensor data
2016-09-02T20:28:17 <alanharnum2> yeah, that appears to be the issue
2016-09-02T20:28:25 <alanharnum2> the events are sent fine, but the logging isn\'t working
2016-09-02T20:29:01 <alanharnum2> well that\'s a good problem i guess
2016-09-02T20:29:16 <alanharnum2> lesson learned for about the 1000th time: make sure you\'re testing the thing you actually care about
2016-09-02T20:29:20 <alanharnum2> rather than a byproduct
2016-09-02T20:31:37 * cindyli has quit
2016-09-02T20:34:58 <Bosmon7> ah cool
2016-09-02T20:40:35 <alanharnum2> or maybe not - it\'s much more pronounced on an iOS device
2016-09-02T20:40:43 <alanharnum2> i\'ll see if I can try & figure out more next week
2016-09-02T20:40:49 <alanharnum2> think there may be something more going on
2016-09-02T20:41:15 <alanharnum2> it looks like there\'s issues with JSON.stringify in the Android Chrome browser, which may be causing other issues if JSON.stringify is being used in other places to send data
2016-09-02T20:43:09 <avtar> bens___: ping
2016-09-02T20:44:22 <Bosmon7> alanharnum - interesting
2016-09-02T20:44:29 <Bosmon7> Perhaps there are some native types lurking in amongst the data
2016-09-02T20:47:01 <alanharnum2> possibly - i\'ll try & dig further next week

2016-09-02T21:10:17 <avtar> bens___, Bosmon, Bosmon7, stegru: gloob and i discovered today that the gpii windows build is failing
2016-09-02T21:11:03 <avtar> https://gist.github.com/michelled/bb3a065d0a16e650e3f3417a20f3c2cd
2016-09-02T21:11:06 <gloob> (with the new box)
2016-09-02T21:11:39 * alanharnum has quit
2016-09-02T21:11:46 <avtar> but bens___, gio, and i ran builds and tests with the same box a few days ago including last night
2016-09-02T21:11:46 <gloob> it doesn\'t happens with current vagrant windows-10 box in atlas (0.3.0)
2016-09-02T21:12:02 <avtar> without any issues
2016-09-02T21:12:08 <gloob> avtar: I tested it with the 0.3.0 and it doesn\'t happen
2016-09-02T21:15:01 <gloob> avtar: ah, yes, probably, correct
2016-09-02T21:16:06 <gloob> avtar: but I run 10 minutes ago a build with 0.3.0 and it build successfully
2016-09-02T21:17:03 <gloob> avtar: trying again with 0.3.0 to be 100% sure
2016-09-02T21:19:50 <avtar> gloob: but if everything was working yesterday for multiple people with the newer box it leads me to believe what\'s changed is dependencies getting pulled in as part of gpii/windows provisioning
2016-09-02T21:20:36 <avtar> https://github.com/GPII/windows/tree/master/provisioning
2016-09-02T21:21:24 <avtar> node is pinned to 4.4.3
2016-09-02T21:22:02 <avtar> it looks like chocolatey\'s python is still at 2.7.11 https://chocolatey.org/packages/python2
2016-09-02T21:22:46 <avtar> and then there are the bits that npm is pulling in
2016-09-02T21:30:17 <gloob> avtar: https://gist.github.com/gloob/320dc79e38297dd0ff017660f70db6f9
2016-09-02T21:30:40 <gloob> avtar: so, why I can build it without problems with 0.3.0?
2016-09-02T21:31:38 <avtar> gloob: older versions of ms build tools comes to mind
2016-09-02T21:31:47 <avtar> but that\'s just a guess at this point
2016-09-02T21:31:54 <gloob> avtar: yes, something of that
2016-09-02T21:32:28 <avtar> if we saw this issue with 0.4.5 right after it was built then we could suspect the build tools that are bundled in the box
2016-09-02T21:32:44 <gloob> the good thing is that the inductor of the bug it is in the toolchain added in the new box or in the new box itself
2016-09-02T21:33:25 <avtar> but since the build was fine yesterday then what\'s changing now is whatever is getting installed from external sources whenever a new environment is created
2016-09-02T21:34:47 <avtar> gloob: another bug is that even though msbuild is erroring out the provisioning process isn\'t failing
2016-09-02T21:34:50 <avtar> ==> default: gyp ERR! stack Error: `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\MSBuild\\14.0\\bin\\msbuild.exe` failed with exit code: 1
2016-09-02T21:35:38 <gloob> avtar: yes, that is clearly a bug
2016-09-02T21:36:20 <gloob> avtar: what I think it happened is that it was compiled before with 0.3.0 box and after adding the new box version it failed, but because it was a silent error verything was running ok
2016-09-02T21:37:04 <gloob> I\'m almost 100% sure that if we were deleting gyp compiled output before we would see this from the beginning
2016-09-02T21:37:22 <gloob> I think that is a second interesting improvement
2016-09-02T21:37:34 <gloob> to do somehow of provisioning clean
2016-09-02T21:37:38 <gloob> a la make clean
2016-09-02T21:38:26 <avtar> yeah
2016-09-02T21:38:53 <Bosmon7> avtar, gloob - very interesting
2016-09-02T21:39:16 <gloob> or, the second scenario is that there\'s something that is being pulled from the box differently?
2016-09-02T21:40:45 <gloob> Bosmon7: do you compile windows gpii in your windows host?
2016-09-02T21:41:15 <gloob> Bosmon7: or always through vagrant?
2016-09-02T21:43:19 <Bosmon7> gloob - I\'ll tell you a somewhat dirty truth
2016-09-02T21:43:29 <Bosmon7> I\'ve still not yet succeeded in getting vagrant windows boxes running on this machine : P
2016-09-02T21:43:36 <Bosmon7> Perhaps someday soon
2016-09-02T21:43:37 * gloob hearing
2016-09-02T21:43:39 <Bosmon7> I always build in my host
2016-09-02T21:43:44 <avtar> uh oh
2016-09-02T21:43:44 <gloob> that is interesting
2016-09-02T21:44:10 <avtar> https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/issues/1011#issuecomment-241976374
2016-09-02T21:44:50 <gloob> great, so bumping to > 3.4.0 fix it
2016-09-02T21:44:56 <avtar> gonna try that
2016-09-02T21:45:04 <gloob> perfect
2016-09-02T21:45:11 <Bosmon7> avtar - yet another reason to hoik ourselves up to npm 3
2016-09-02T21:45:17 <avtar> yes :/
2016-09-02T21:45:21 <gloob> I will write the build.bat issue in jira
2016-09-02T21:45:29 <avtar> thanks gloob!
2016-09-02T21:45:32 <Bosmon7> I still need to roll that Infusion release
2016-09-02T21:45:41 <Bosmon7> Well, let me do it now
2016-09-02T21:45:57 <gloob> Bosmon7: please please please
2016-09-02T21:46:04 <Bosmon7> There\'s a few fixes I\'d really like, but a release costs nothing!
2016-09-02T21:46:24 <gloob> this is somehow a GPII Friday\'s party night
2016-09-02T21:46:44 <avtar> gloob: we\'ve had a couple gpii windows friday parties :P
2016-09-02T21:46:54 <Bosmon7> I am so old that I feel proud rather than ashamed to be doing this on a Friday night :)
2016-09-02T21:47:17 <gloob> Bosmon7: I understand that :P
2016-09-02T21:47:36 <avtar> i don\'t know how you two do this on fridays when you have tiny people to raise...
2016-09-02T21:47:46 <avtar> i can barely manage my own life
2016-09-02T21:47:57 <gloob> avtar: in my case, she is sleeping now
2016-09-02T21:48:24 <gloob> avtar: well, I can barely manage my own life now, so...
2016-09-02T21:51:04 <Bosmon7> avtar - right now they are sleeping
2016-09-02T21:51:14 <Bosmon7> snap
2016-09-02T21:51:37 <Bosmon7> ok incredibly enough I think this vagrant box is actually running : P
2016-09-02T21:51:56 <gloob> Bosmon7: anyway now it is the good times for you, you are just the errands guy, things getting interesting in the long run, sorry
2016-09-02T21:53:35 <Bosmon7> Poor, feeble little 2007 laptop
2016-09-02T21:53:42 <Bosmon7> It was never designed for this thrashing
2016-09-02T21:54:02 <gloob> sure not, my macbook is from 2008 and cry hard with vagrant
2016-09-02T21:54:45 <Bosmon7> ok, so this failed again
2016-09-02T21:54:57 <Bosmon7> default: WinRM transport: negotiate

2016-09-02T21:55:02 <Bosmon7> Ring any bells, avtar, gloob?
2016-09-02T21:55:23 <Bosmon7> The VM did visibly seem to try to start up
2016-09-02T21:55:59 <gloob> sounds to me
2016-09-02T21:56:06 <gloob> you need to uprise the timeout
2016-09-02T21:56:10 <gloob> your machine is crazy slow
2016-09-02T21:57:09 <gloob> If I remember well there\'s two kind of timeouts that you can add in the Vagrantfile
2016-09-02T21:57:24 <Bosmon7> Sure, my machine is crazy slow
2016-09-02T21:57:44 <Bosmon7> Ok gloob, an Infusion is published - you can try binding to version 2.0.0-dev.20160902T155354Z.b963420
2016-09-02T21:58:37 <Bosmon7> This has my fix for FLUID-5940
2016-09-02T21:58:48 <avtar> sorry, all
2016-09-02T21:58:56 <avtar> still trying to set this up and take a snapshot before i proceed
2016-09-02T21:58:58 <avtar> one sec
2016-09-02T21:59:20 <gloob> Bosmon7: do a vagrant restart
2016-09-02T21:59:54 <Bosmon7> vagrant reload, you mean?
2016-09-02T21:59:55 <Bosmon7> Or what
2016-09-02T22:00:51 <gloob> Bosmon7: yes "vagrant reload"
2016-09-02T22:01:01 <gloob> Bosmon7: if same happened, add in Vagrantfile this, config.winrm.timeout - The max number of seconds to wait for a WinRM response, defaults to 1800 seconds.
2016-09-02T22:01:18 <Bosmon7> I\'m pretty sure it didn\'t take that long
2016-09-02T22:01:36 <Bosmon7> 30 minutes for a response?
2016-09-02T22:01:39 <Bosmon7> It was a most 5 minutes
2016-09-02T22:01:59 <Bosmon7> vagrant reload gives "==> default: VM not created. Moving on..."
2016-09-02T22:02:13 <gloob> config.vm.boot_timeout = 1800
2016-09-02T22:02:13 <Bosmon7> Indeed somehow the VM seems to be gone
2016-09-02T22:02:33 <Bosmon7> It was certainly there for a while
2016-09-02T22:06:57 <gloob> oh, Bosmon7 which vagrant version are you using?
2016-09-02T22:07:23 <gloob> by the way, thank you for the release!
2016-09-02T22:23:23 <avtar> Bosmon7, gloob: upgrading node-gyp to 3.4.0 appears to resolve the build issue https://paste.fedoraproject.org/420134/
2016-09-02T22:24:13 <gloob> great
2016-09-02T22:24:30 <avtar> unit and acceptance tests pass with the 0.4.5 box
2016-09-02T22:24:51 <gloob> PR it
2016-09-02T22:27:08 <avtar> gloob: i tested this by updating npm\'s bundled node-gyp https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/wiki/Updating-npm\'s-bundled-node-gyp#windows
2016-09-02T22:28:41 <avtar> can we move towards npm 3.*?
2016-09-02T22:30:00 <gloob> we are on it
2016-09-02T22:32:32 <gloob> avtar: upgrading to npm3 it get fixed too?
2016-09-02T22:34:25 <gloob> ok, I understand that yes
2016-09-02T22:34:26 <gloob> npm bundles its own, internal, copy of node-gyp.
2016-09-02T22:35:11 <gloob> avtar: I will speed up with the new PRs for npm3 now that Bosmon7 did the new release of infusion
2016-09-02T22:35:18 <gloob> but now, call it a day
2016-09-02T22:35:29 <gloob> thank you gentlemen and good night
2016-09-02T22:35:34 <avtar> gloob: same here
2016-09-02T22:35:49 <avtar> btw it\'s a long weekend here so i\'ll be back on tuesday
2016-09-02T22:36:02 <gloob> avtar: right, have fun!
2016-09-02T22:36:07 <avtar> another btw https://github.com/npm/npm/wiki/Troubleshooting#upgrading-on-windows
2016-09-02T22:36:39 <avtar> looks like this https://github.com/felixrieseberg/npm-windows-upgrade needs to be used to potentially avoid the path issues
2016-09-02T22:37:03 <gloob> we can add it into the provisioning scripts no?
2016-09-02T22:37:16 <avtar> that\'s up to you to find out on monday ;)
2016-09-02T22:37:29 <gloob> :/
2016-09-02T22:37:47 <gloob> let\'s see what I can miserably do
'

b'2016-09-02T14:49:48 <stegru> ok
2016-09-02T14:50:02 <Bosmon7> But we just need to keep the idea in mind
2016-09-02T14:50:12 <Bosmon7> And make sure we don\'t do anything that suddenly massively raises the costs of supporting XP
2016-09-02T14:50:17 <Bosmon7> (to the best our of knowledge)
2016-09-02T14:54:29 <Bosmon7> I think the next CI environment we need is Windows 10 32-bit
2016-09-02T14:54:37 <Bosmon7> Then Windows 8, then Windows 7
2016-09-02T14:54:56 <Bosmon7> Then we can dream of thinking about XP, if we miraculously find ourselves awash with resources :)
2016-09-02T14:57:40 <stegru> xp, the victim of its own success
2016-09-02T14:59:34 <Bosmon7> Yeah
2016-09-02T14:59:44 <Bosmon7> I still had XP on my mother\'s PC until last year
2016-09-02T14:59:54 <Bosmon7> And she didn\'t enjoy the upgrade
2016-09-02T15:06:08 * jhung joined the channel
2016-09-02T15:08:18 <stegru> Bosmon: GPII-1540 doesn\'t reproduce on 32-bit windows 7 - if the magnifier is left open, it appears on the lock screen. if it is killed instantly, it doesn\'t appear
2016-09-02T15:09:48 <stegru> so it wont reproduce on windows 7 in general
2016-09-02T15:11:10 <Bosmon7> stegru - excellent, really good to know
2016-09-02T15:11:31 <Bosmon7> I was just starting the download of our giant vagrant box on this tiny bargain basement BT broadband :)
2016-09-02T15:12:09 <Bosmon7> ah
2016-09-02T15:12:16 <Bosmon7> There are some broken versions of this aren\'t there....
2016-09-02T15:13:13 <stegru> of..?
2016-09-02T15:14:10 <Bosmon7> Right, I need vagrant 1.8.4 ....
2016-09-02T15:14:12 <Bosmon7> I remember this now
2016-09-02T15:14:34 <stegru> oh i just loaded it directly in virtual box
2016-09-02T15:15:12 <stegru> i had an iso lying around
2016-09-02T15:27:12 <avtar> Bosmon7: are you still downloading at the moment?
2016-09-02T15:28:04 <avtar> because there\'s a newer 0.4.5 box that we\'re waiting to release next week
2016-09-02T15:28:25 <avtar> you might as well grab that instead and save some bandwidth later

2016-09-02T17:22:01 <gloob> simonjb: I think that yes, because you are the only windows tester :P
2016-09-02T17:22:37 <gloob> prfff, XP is going to be the most expensive to implement in vagrant I guess
2016-09-02T17:36:57 * alanharnum joined the channel
2016-09-02T17:40:04 <alanharnum> Bosmon / Bosmon7: thank you for that merge - glad to have that in!
2016-09-02T17:41:59 <avtar> gloob: simonjb uses opensuse whereas i use windows 10
2016-09-02T17:43:18 <avtar> simonjb: i wasn\'t aware of this but ben uses rhel and he said everything checked out with the new changes so you don\'t need to spend time on that if you don\'t want to

2016-09-02T19:32:15 <Bosmon7> or how I can do it?
2016-09-02T19:32:30 <Bosmon7> My guess is I need something like 1 laptop and 2 Android devices of some kind?
2016-09-02T19:32:54 <Bosmon7> Oh wow
2016-09-02T19:32:59 <Bosmon7> Sorry, I should have checked my mail
2016-09-02T19:33:02 <alanharnum> At minimum for it to be at all interesting you probably need 1 laptop + 1 other device
2016-09-02T19:33:14 <alanharnum> Bosmon7: I was about to ask that as my next question :)
2016-09-02T19:33:30 <alanharnum> i did a slight cleanup of my rough notes from working with Simon
2016-09-02T19:34:08 <Bosmon7> Ah
2016-09-02T19:34:10 <alanharnum> note that I was using my Mac laptop as the control computer, though I don\'t think there should be any issue using a Windows one
2016-09-02T19:34:13 <Bosmon7> We do have an Android client, right?
2016-09-02T19:34:19 <Bosmon7> The instructions mention iPads etc
2016-09-02T19:34:55 <alanharnum> I\'m not sure the Orientation demo works properly with Android
2016-09-02T19:35:04 <Bosmon7> Oh dear
2016-09-02T19:35:12 <alanharnum> but any of the others should, though the piano doesn\'t display well on my phone
2016-09-02T19:35:40 <Bosmon7> How do the clients work?
2016-09-02T19:35:46 <Bosmon7> Is it all just webapps or what?
2016-09-02T19:35:49 <alanharnum> just webapps
2016-09-02T19:36:11 <alanharnum> you connect the clients to a network where they can reach the control computer, which is running the Nexus demos as well as the Nexus
2016-09-02T19:36:30 <Bosmon7> ok
2016-09-02T19:36:34 <alanharnum> and it\'s serving the demos on port 8080, they connect to various demo pages on there
2016-09-02T19:36:50 <Bosmon7> So when you say the Orientation demo doesn\'t work properly, this will be a limitation of some HTML5 API in some Android browser?
2016-09-02T19:36:58 <alanharnum> i\'m not 100% sure
2016-09-02T19:37:08 <alanharnum> i think i tested it briefly with my phone & it didn\'t work
2016-09-02T19:37:08 <Bosmon7> This is demo which we do in the video, right?
2016-09-02T19:37:15 <Bosmon7> Which has one person pinging and one person wobulating?
2016-09-02T19:37:15 <alanharnum> yup, the musical one
2016-09-02T19:37:27 <alanharnum> but i never looked too closely at why it didn\'t
2016-09-02T19:37:35 <Bosmon7> Ok
2016-09-02T19:37:44 <Bosmon7> Well we have a couple of days to tinker with this
2016-09-02T19:37:52 <Bosmon7> But in theory it would be nice to be able to produce a demo on Thursday
2016-09-02T19:37:53 <Bosmon7> perhaps Friday
2016-09-02T19:38:18 <Bosmon7> I have access to 2 Android tablets and 2 Android phones of various vintages
2016-09-02T19:38:20 <Bosmon7> Sadly no Apple equipment
2016-09-02T19:38:40 <alanharnum> i am reasonably certain it would be pretty quick to get the orientation sensor working with Android as well
2016-09-02T19:38:53 <Bosmon7> ok
2016-09-02T19:38:58 <Bosmon7> That\'s awesome
2016-09-02T19:39:03 <alanharnum> if you run any of various HTML5 demos for the orientation sensor, they work fine
2016-09-02T19:39:07 <alanharnum> (in Android browser)
2016-09-02T19:39:09 <Bosmon7> Asterics is only required for the headtracker, right?
2016-09-02T19:39:15 <alanharnum> so i suspect it\'s something about our implementation, etc
2016-09-02T19:39:17 <Bosmon7> So I can skip that if I just want to demo "orientation"
2016-09-02T19:39:20 <alanharnum> yes
2016-09-02T19:39:24 <Bosmon7> ok
2016-09-02T19:39:27 <Bosmon7> That cuts out a lot
2016-09-02T19:39:39 <alanharnum> yeah Asterics setup is the most complicated piece
2016-09-02T19:39:48 <Bosmon7> That just leaves me to figure out how on earth I can share my connection over Wifi on Windows
2016-09-02T19:39:52 <Bosmon7> Which is something I\'ve never seen work very well
2016-09-02T19:40:00 <Bosmon7> I can certainly take my own router along to the demo
2016-09-02T19:40:06 <Bosmon7> But that itself needs to connect to something
2016-09-02T19:40:09 <Bosmon7> Actually I guess it doesn\'t
2016-09-02T19:40:22 <Bosmon7> I can just make a private network with it pretty easily, I guess
2016-09-02T19:40:25 <alanharnum> you shouldn\'t need an actual internet connection i believe
2016-09-02T19:40:28 <Bosmon7> ok
2016-09-02T19:40:29 <alanharnum> a private network should be fine
2016-09-02T19:40:34 <Bosmon7> This is the beginnings of a plan
2016-09-02T19:40:48 <Bosmon7> I\'ll tinker with stuff over the weekend and share my findings
2016-09-02T19:40:52 <alanharnum> i believe Windows may be the same as as Mac in that you have to have an Ethernet internet connection to turn on connection sharing via wifi
2016-09-02T19:41:12 <Bosmon7> Will it be obvious what the URL etc is for the Orientation demo?
2016-09-02T19:41:41 <alanharnum> it\'s pretty easy to find in OSX or Linux using ifconfig
2016-09-02T19:42:01 <alanharnum> should be similar in Windows via ipconfig or similar, although firewall etc might make it more complicated
2016-09-02T19:42:11 <Bosmon7> Ok, I guess there\'s just the index.html
2016-09-02T19:42:16 <alanharnum> yeah
2016-09-02T19:42:41 <alanharnum> a client device on the private network needs to go (via browser) to a URL like "http:192.168.1.105:8080" and go to demos from there
2016-09-02T19:43:03 <Bosmon7> Ok
2016-09-02T19:43:04 <Bosmon7> https://github.com/simonbates/nexus-demos/blob/master/demos/device-orientation/index.html
2016-09-02T19:43:06 <Bosmon7> I see this
2016-09-02T19:43:12 <Bosmon7> But it is just for the orientation bit
2016-09-02T19:43:26 <Bosmon7> How do I do the full demo with one person making sounds and one person doing orientation?
2016-09-02T19:43:50 <alanharnum> You need (at minimum):
2016-09-02T19:43:59 <alanharnum> - the bonang synth open in a browser on the control computer
2016-09-02T19:44:05 <Bosmon7> ah ok
2016-09-02T19:44:35 <alanharnum> - a controller demo open in a browser on the control computer or a client device
2016-09-02T19:45:11 <alanharnum> - a client device with an orientation sensor with a browser open to the orientation demo
2016-09-02T19:45:14 <alanharnum> then you can get the "wobble"
2016-09-02T19:48:09 <alanharnum> when do you need to demo this?

2016-09-02T19:52:04 <alanharnum2> Bosmon / Bosmon7: gonna test the Android tilt situation on my setup RQ so I can give you a better answer
2016-09-02T20:00:00 <Bosmon7> Thursday or Friday
2016-09-02T20:00:04 <Bosmon7> Thanks so much, alanharnum2!
2016-09-02T20:03:51 <alanharnum2> Bosmon7: it definitely doesn\'t work, but I\'m gonna see if I can figure out why
2016-09-02T20:04:31 <alanharnum2> it\'s possible it\'s because of this, but I get that as a warning message after I hook the phone up in debug mode, rather than an error: https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security/deprecating-powerful-features-on-insecure-origins
2016-09-02T20:10:24 <Bosmon7> Ah, fascinating
2016-09-02T20:11:00 * gtirloni has quit
2016-09-02T20:19:29 <alanharnum2> Bosmon7: Actually I think it may work fine
2016-09-02T20:19:40 <alanharnum2> the issue seems to be that (not sure why on this) the visible logging doesn\'t work
2016-09-02T20:19:46 <alanharnum2> on the actual demo page
2016-09-02T20:19:56 <alanharnum2> but as far as I can tell it\'s sending signals successfully
2016-09-02T20:20:09 <alanharnum2> and you can get the "wobble" effect with an Android device
2016-09-02T20:20:40 <alanharnum2> iirc we never looked at it too closely, just saw it wasn\'t visibly logging the signals, assumed it wasn\'t working, shrugged, and went to iOS devices given the timelines
2016-09-02T20:26:34 <Bosmon7> oh ok
2016-09-02T20:26:36 <Bosmon7> That\'s great
2016-09-02T20:26:42 <Bosmon7> What is the "visible logging"?

2016-09-02T13:56:12 <Bosmon7> Hi there avtar - do you know if we have standard VM images of 32-bit versions of Windows?
2016-09-02T13:56:49 <avtar> hey Bosmon7
2016-09-02T13:56:50 * michelled joined the channel
2016-09-02T13:56:54 <avtar> no we don\'t
2016-09-02T13:57:26 <avtar> gloob has a jira for that
2016-09-02T13:57:48 <Bosmon7> ok
2016-09-02T13:57:55 <Bosmon7> I\'d like to test stegru\'s patch for https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-1540
2016-09-02T13:58:56 <Bosmon7> How did you do your testing, stegru... did you just happen to have one around?
2016-09-02T13:59:10 <Bosmon7> Hi cindyli, sorry I missed your question last night
2016-09-02T13:59:32 <stegru> no, i don\'t have one - i just started the magnifier manually
2016-09-02T13:59:41 <cindyli> no problem Bosmon7, it was pretty late at ur time
2016-09-02T14:00:56 <cindyli> i pinged u because there\'s an issue with having a createOnEvent on a express middleware. gpii.express has its own way to wire up children middle wares
2016-09-02T14:01:13 <Bosmon7> Started the magnifier manually....
2016-09-02T14:01:19 <Bosmon7> I guess I\'m still pretty confused about this bug
2016-09-02T14:01:51 <cindyli> i guess tony might be able to shed some light
2016-09-02T14:02:09 <Bosmon7> cindyli - I don\'t think that createOnEvent is meaningfull for a piece of express middleware
2016-09-02T14:02:20 <Bosmon7> The whole point of the express idiom is that the application structure is known statically
2016-09-02T14:02:25 <stegru> i think both the 32 and 64-bit magnifier (and osk) perform the same - but the 32-bit one writes to the 32-bit part of the registry, which 64-bit windows doesn\'t read
2016-09-02T14:03:07 <Bosmon7> stegru - ah, you mean you started the 32-bit magnifier manually?
2016-09-02T14:03:08 <cindyli> Bosmon7: good to know. probably instead of restarting the pouch express middleware, i should restart the entire express
2016-09-02T14:03:34 <Bosmon7> cindyli - sounds like an awful mess
2016-09-02T14:03:49 <cindyli> :(
2016-09-02T14:04:22 <Bosmon7> I\'m trying to convince atkins that we need to ditch express-pouchdb
2016-09-02T14:04:29 <Bosmon7> It\'s so riddled with limitations and problems
2016-09-02T14:04:45 <stegru> Bosmon: no, 64-bit (node executes the 32-bit)
2016-09-02T14:04:57 <Bosmon7> Yes, it does sound like there\'s no alternative to putting express-pouchdb in its own express server
2016-09-02T14:05:00 <Bosmon7> And then restarting that
2016-09-02T14:05:05 <Bosmon7> This will deal with your routing problems too
2016-09-02T14:05:19 <cindyli> ok, trying
2016-09-02T14:05:21 * michelled has quit
2016-09-02T14:05:55 <Bosmon7> stegru - sorry to be so dim
2016-09-02T14:06:14 <Bosmon7> I\'m really having trouble wrapping my head around all the conditions for this bug : P
2016-09-02T14:06:46 <Bosmon7> So when you said in the JIRA comment.... "I\'ve been reproducing this with the method that Sandra Ellett-Salmoran discovered" ... "My initial findings are in Windows 10 (and possibly 8, 7 unknown)"
2016-09-02T14:06:54 <Bosmon7> These were all with 64-bit versions of Windows then, right?
2016-09-02T14:07:23 <stegru> erm..
2016-09-02T14:07:50 <stegru> 32... Environment:
2016-09-02T14:07:50 <stegru> GPII.151214.031038.msi
2016-09-02T14:07:50 <stegru> Windows 8.1 32-bit
2016-09-02T14:07:58 <Bosmon7> Well right
2016-09-02T14:08:03 <Bosmon7> But I\'m talking about your reproduction of it
2016-09-02T14:08:03 * michelled joined the channel
2016-09-02T14:08:07 <Bosmon7> And you said you didn\'t have any 32-bit windows?
2016-09-02T14:08:51 <stegru> that\'s right, i started it manually - in fact, i did not realise it mattered until later on
2016-09-02T14:09:41 <Bosmon7> Ok, you started it manually - what did you do next?
2016-09-02T14:10:22 * jhung_away has quit
2016-09-02T14:11:01 <stegru> I killed it (manually at first, but also via gpii by logging out)
2016-09-02T14:11:19 <stegru> then I did alt+ctrl+del, and it came back again
2016-09-02T14:11:47 <Bosmon7> Ah
2016-09-02T14:12:17 <Bosmon7> But how did you convince the GPII to log out and kill something which it hadn\'t created
2016-09-02T14:12:27 <Bosmon7> I guess you closed the magnifier it opened, and then opened another one?
2016-09-02T14:12:58 <stegru> it just kills any process by that name, regardless of who/what started it
2016-09-02T14:13:01 <Bosmon7> Right
2016-09-02T14:14:03 <Bosmon7> But because of GPII-1757, it starts the wrong one?
2016-09-02T14:14:22 <stegru> yes, and i did not realise that until i started 1757
2016-09-02T14:15:30 <stegru> when i did my final testing (after I fixed it), i used GPII properly - and it worked, although it turns out that test wasn\'t accurate enough
2016-09-02T14:19:06 <Bosmon7> ok
2016-09-02T14:19:21 <Bosmon7> Really sorry for this tedious line of questioning.... but I\'m still not sure that I have this all straight
2016-09-02T14:19:38 <Bosmon7> So 1757 bites, ONLY when the bitness of node and Windows is mismatched?
2016-09-02T14:19:53 <stegru> yes, that\'s right
2016-09-02T14:20:22 <Bosmon7> So, if I have both a 64-bit node and a 64-bit windows, we should NOT have 1757
2016-09-02T14:20:50 <Bosmon7> And therefore I should be able to observe 1540, with respect to the magnifier?
2016-09-02T14:21:08 <Bosmon7> Or is that I should NOT be able to observe 1540...........
2016-09-02T14:21:38 <Bosmon7> IF we launch the correct (64-bit magnifier).... it should be dumping its stuff in the correct part of the registry
2016-09-02T14:21:39 <stegru> hang on, i\'ve lost it now
2016-09-02T14:22:15 <Bosmon7> And then when I CTRL-ALT-DEL, it should reappear after the GPII kills it crassly?
2016-09-02T14:22:25 <stegru> that\'s right.. 64bit node on 64-bit OS.. no 1757
2016-09-02T14:22:52 <Bosmon7> I\'m just trying to work out which giant Windows machine image it\'s best worth my while to download in order to observe this bug :)
2016-09-02T14:23:06 <stegru> 32-bit node on 64 bit os = 1757, but not 1540
2016-09-02T14:23:11 <Bosmon7> For some reason I can\'t provoke it on the only VM I have on this machine, which is a 64-bit Windows 7
2016-09-02T14:23:26 <stegru> it could be a windows 8+ problem
2016-09-02T14:23:29 <Bosmon7> But I\'m trying to work out whether that\'s just because it\'s Windows 7 or because I don\'t completely understand the bug
2016-09-02T14:23:31 <Bosmon7> ok
2016-09-02T14:23:58 <stegru> i started to install 32-bit 7 last night, so i\'ll finish it and check
2016-09-02T14:24:05 <Bosmon7> ok
2016-09-02T14:24:42 <stegru> i think it is 8+, because of the accessibility something-or-another.. you know, that msdn link from a few weeks back
2016-09-02T14:25:20 <Bosmon7> Oh right
2016-09-02T14:25:24 <Bosmon7> v.interesting
2016-09-02T14:25:43 <stegru> yes: Ease of Access \xe2\x80\x93 Assistive Technology Registration https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb879984.aspx
2016-09-02T14:25:51 <Bosmon7> I went to the photo printing kiosk at the chemist\'s round the corner from here just now and I found that it was sitting on an ancient Windows XP box :)
2016-09-02T14:25:56 <stegru> "Windows 8 introduces several configuration options that..."
2016-09-02T14:26:00 <Bosmon7> Good luck to us making that accessible
2016-09-02T14:26:09 <stegru> xp is everywhere
2016-09-02T14:26:19 <Bosmon7> Yes
2016-09-02T14:26:33 <stegru> my daughter needs it to dual-boot to play the sims
2016-09-02T14:26:48 <Bosmon7> I\'ve been one of the stick-in-the-muds since the earliest days of the project suggesting that we couldn\'t ultimately, in the long run afford to forget about XP
2016-09-02T14:26:55 <stegru> and i\'m clinging onto it because the update servers for drivers are dead
2016-09-02T14:26:59 <Bosmon7> And in fact its people with accessibility needs who are the most likely to have outdated IT kit
2016-09-02T14:27:05 <stegru> exactly
2016-09-02T14:27:21 <Bosmon7> We are now discovering this is exactly the case at the American Job Centres we may be deploying at
2016-09-02T14:27:36 <Bosmon7> Hats off to Mozilla for continuing to make builds of Firefox available for XP
2016-09-02T14:27:55 <stegru> yeh, some people have no choice to use it
2016-09-02T14:28:42 <Bosmon7> https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/3804
2016-09-02T14:28:48 <Bosmon7> Looks like we\'ll at least get support for node 4.x on XP
2016-09-02T14:28:58 <Bosmon7> So we\'d better take care not to leave this ecosystem behind completely
2016-09-02T14:29:22 * gtirloni joined the channel
2016-09-02T14:30:00 <Bosmon7> node 4.x is competent enough, and will have been in LTS for 18 months by the time it gets supplanted
2016-09-02T14:30:04 <Bosmon7> So we may be able to get lucky with this
2016-09-02T14:30:17 <Bosmon7> I worry about electron though
2016-09-02T14:30:28 <Bosmon7> They\'ve always been more aggressive about pushing V8 versions
2016-09-02T14:30:44 <stegru> is it possible to target both node 4 and 6?
2016-09-02T14:30:52 <Bosmon7> stegru - I think so, yes
2016-09-02T14:31:16 <Bosmon7> As we discussed in our Windows meetings, use of node 4 together with npm 3 is just an inconvenience, rather than a show-stopper
2016-09-02T14:31:26 <Bosmon7> It just requires us to proliferate yet more and more CI configurations
2016-09-02T14:31:30 <Bosmon7> "just"
2016-09-02T14:31:34 <stegru> ok
2016-09-02T14:32:16 <Bosmon7> The problem is, if we deliver desktop UI using electron, I don\'t believe there\'s any viable version of that bound to a node 4-era version of V8
2016-09-02T14:32:39 <Bosmon7> Anyway, we won\'t be tackling this for a couple of years
2016-09-02T14:32:48 <Bosmon7> For the initial pilots, I think we will get to choose our hardware
2016-09-02T14:32:56 <stegru> next year\'s problem :)
2016-09-02T14:33:04 <Bosmon7> Perhaps by 2018 XP might really be starting to fade away
2016-09-02T14:33:08 <Bosmon7> Although I\'m not holding my breath

2016-09-02T14:34:38 <stegru> so.. (i don\'t want to say this, but) if XP support could be a future requirement, then shouldn\'t there still be some tests on XP?
2016-09-02T14:35:27 <stegru> just sanity tests
2016-09-02T14:36:21 <kavya> Stegru: yes..we need to have some tests
2016-09-02T14:37:12 <kavya> i raised the same issue with sandra..MS doesnt support xp anymore

2016-09-02T14:39:42 <stegru> well, i wont be actively testing my things on XP (unless ordered, of course), but i\'ll certainly keep XP in mind
2016-09-02T14:46:56 <Bosmon7> stegru - in theory, yes - but even mounting sanity tests costs more than we can afford at the moment
2016-09-02T14:47:00 <Bosmon7> We need to priorities our environments
2016-09-02T14:49:14 <Bosmon7> prioritise
