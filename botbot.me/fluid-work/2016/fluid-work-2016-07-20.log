2016-07-20T18:04:35 <bens__> hi sgithens,  on the Windows.Networking.Proximity (issue 396 w/ edge.js) were you looking for a second set of eyes on the syntax issue, using a WinRT dll, or both?
2016-07-20T18:08:04 <sgithens> bens__ I guess maybe both.  I\'m pretty sure I ended up getting the syntax figured out.  Mostly if someone can successfully pull in that assembly I was trying to use.  However, I\'m not sure if it would be available on a machine that doesn\'t have a builtin NFC/proximity device or not.  I would hope that it would still be there, but just show no registered devices...
2016-07-20T18:08:06 <sgithens> or something
2016-07-20T18:08:30 * jhung joined the channel
2016-07-20T18:08:49 * kasparnet joined the channel
2016-07-20T18:10:56 <sgithens> bens__ : These Windows.Networking.Proximity calls are specifically what I want to get called from edge:  https://github.com/sgithens/gpii-windows-8/blob/master/GPIIWindows8/GPIIProximityListener.cs#L8
2016-07-20T18:11:17 <sgithens> Then I can just bake this in to our local node app
2016-07-20T18:12:01 <sgithens> At the this point I\'ve moved the rest of this repository to running inside an Electron App, expect for the Proximity Listener bit
2016-07-20T18:15:00 <bens__> sgithens, the syntax is an easy fix. if you\'re not using lambda expressions in line you need to meet the convention edgejs uses which means a class named Startup and a method named Invoke. https://gist.github.com/benjaminstokes/fccc724702b4f76e728b7fd23273a812
2016-07-20T18:15:34 <bens__> i\'ll have to dig more on the proximity library. what system are you running on? windows 10, 8?
2016-07-20T18:16:34 * the-t-in-rtf has quit
2016-07-20T18:17:38 <sgithens> bens__ Cool, thanks.   It could be either windows 8 or 10.  We\'ve decided to use 10 for our upcoming release so probably best to start testing on there.

2016-07-20T18:45:30 <bens__> sgithens, what OS did you work on that Windows 8 repo with? I\'m guessing now windows 7?
2016-07-20T18:45:53 <bens__> s/now/not
2016-07-20T18:47:54 <sgithens> bens__ Both windows 8 and 10
2016-07-20T18:48:11 <sgithens> I maybe only compiled it on windows 8, but we\'ve been running it on both
2016-07-20T18:49:18 <bens__> i think its going to be possible.. but i need to get myself a windows 8 or + vm to sketch it out
2016-07-20T18:50:12 <bens__> fairly certain the .net code will have to be compiled ahead of time.. which isn\'t an issue really it just makes prototyping a bit harder

2016-07-20T18:58:33 <sgithens> Do you know what\'s different about the Networking.Proximity library that it would have to be compiled rather than just interpreted on the fly?

2016-07-20T19:42:59 <bens__> sgithens, you have to jump through a hoop or two to pull the WinRT libs in as references from a non-windows-store app
2016-07-20T19:43:42 <bens__> described here: http://www.hanselman.com/blog/HowToCallWinRTAPIsInWindows8FromCDesktopApplicationsWinRTDiagram.aspx
2016-07-20T19:47:19 <clown> bens__, this is one of things I am looking for (thread state):  https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.diagnostics.processthread.threadstate(v=vs.110).aspx
2016-07-20T19:47:43 <clown> and, that can be found via the process\'s threads from the document url you sent earlier.
2016-07-20T19:48:12 <clown> that is, it looks like one can ask for a processes threads, and then, in turn query them.
2016-07-20T19:51:27 <bens__> clown, whats the general use case.. i think you said its part of the process reporter? Are you polling every N seconds/minutes/etc for all processes running? Are you looking for a specific process (like by name)?
2016-07-20T19:53:29 <clown> yes, I am looking by name.  That much I have working.  Once I\'ve found the process, I want to know its state.
2016-07-20T19:55:39 * michelled joined the channel
2016-07-20T19:57:34 <bens__> clown, i\'ll get an example together that\'ll do that w/ edge
2016-07-20T19:59:07 <clown> bens__, cool thanks!.
2016-07-20T19:59:50 <clown> bens__, regarding your question about the general use case:  I have written a fluid component that can be used to poll for GPII solutions -- which ones are running, which ones have stopped, etc.
2016-07-20T20:00:04 <clown> And, that all works on linux.
2016-07-20T20:00:29 <clown> The only thing I need to "bootstrap" it on Windows is to get a list of processes, and some information about them (eg., their state).
2016-07-20T20:01:48 <clown> Using node-ffi, I can get that list, the names of the proceesses (e.g., notepad.exe), the full path to the process.  I\'m currently missing the state.

2016-07-20T20:03:18 <clown> although, part of me is thinking:  If it\'s in the process list, it\'s state is "running", and if it\'s not, then it\'s "not running".  :-)
2016-07-20T20:04:01 * clown argh  not it\'s , but its.
2016-07-20T20:06:56 <bens__> clown, i could see there being a difference between windows and linux states. i just found this on google: http://www.macdesign.net/academic/it4813/it4813-Submitted/IT4813-u03a1-Process_States.html

2016-07-20T20:24:58 <clown> bens__, thanks for that article.  It points to a potential problem with my component.  Namely, it\'s assuming the linux states.
2016-07-20T20:25:31 <clown> I"ll have to isolate that in the linux vs. windows implementations to use the proper states depending on the OS.

2016-07-20T20:42:29 <bens__> hey clown, take a look at this gist: https://gist.github.com/benjaminstokes/fbedb80cfb14a77ee7884a73c66d4a1d
2016-07-20T20:43:53 <bens__> looks like the environment variables couldn\'t be serialized to json.. nothing we can\'t fix if we need them, but that is the sort of info we can get. other properties could be added too.. i just picked a few that looked useful
2016-07-20T20:44:22 <clown> wow, that\'s a lot of info.  :-)
2016-07-20T20:45:16 <bens__> hehehe.. we can also trim it down :)
2016-07-20T20:45:16 <clown> I see what you mean by serializing to json \xe2\x80\x94 lots of [Object]
2016-07-20T20:47:30 * colinclark has quit
2016-07-20T20:47:39 <bens__> yeah.. those are IDictionary<string, string> types. I wonder if that is a depth limit on the serialization that can be tweaked.. or we could serialize it ourselves.
2016-07-20T20:48:33 <clown> well, that makes me think that using edge.js is a better approach than what I\'ve been doing with node-ffi.
2016-07-20T20:50:23 <clown> shoot.  I have to start wrapping up in order to catch my train home, bens__
2016-07-20T20:50:49 <bens__> clown, it seems to me that there is less code required in the edge.js approach over node-ffi to do the same thing.. and that code is a little easier to follow, despite having another layer
2016-07-20T20:52:00 <bens__> clown, don\'t miss the train.. we can catch up later
2016-07-20T20:52:18 <clown> one last question before I drop off about https://gist.github.com/benjaminstokes/fbedb80cfb14a77ee7884a73c66d4a1d#file-edgejs-process-info-sketch-L166
2016-07-20T20:52:39 <clown> the call Process.GetProcessesByName() built-in, or did you write it?
2016-07-20T20:52:58 <bens__> built in to the .net framework
2016-07-20T20:53:16 <bens__> upper case Process there is the System.Diagnostics.Process class
2016-07-20T20:54:21 <clown> okay, thanks.
2016-07-20T20:54:54 <clown> I\'ll catch you later \xe2\x80\x94 have a good evening (depending on where you are).  Thanks again, bens__

2016-07-20T10:58:38 <kasparne_> hehe, I\'m not sure this qualifies as "Trop tot de la matin" :D
2016-07-20T10:58:41 <kasparne_> hey man
2016-07-20T10:58:47 <kasparne_> how did the wedding go?
2016-07-20T11:01:32 <kasparne_> Bosmon: ok - back here.
2016-07-20T11:01:41 <kasparne_> so I was looking at https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/457
2016-07-20T11:01:49 <kasparne_> and have adressed most of the comments
2016-07-20T11:02:02 <kasparne_> but there is one thing I\'m not quite certain how to go about
2016-07-20T11:02:11 <Bosmon> Yes, which I have just referred to in my upcoming journal pull...
2016-07-20T11:02:20 <kasparne_> ooh cool
2016-07-20T11:02:28 <kasparne_> how is that one going btw?
2016-07-20T11:02:47 <kasparne_> anyway, I\'m not quite certain how to do about the fullSolutionsRegistry
2016-07-20T11:03:16 <kasparne_> ie. to what extend I should pass it around vs. whether I should query the registry every time I want to use it
2016-07-20T11:04:06 <kasparne_> right now, I\'ve stuck it on to the payload that is passed around in the system pre-matchmaking.. But removing it before actually sending it to the matchmaker (as we dont need the full registry at that point anymore)
2016-07-20T11:12:44 <Bosmon> It\'s going sort of ok
2016-07-20T11:12:56 <Bosmon> Writing the tests for it is perhaps somewhat harder than actually implementing it
2016-07-20T11:13:20 <Bosmon> I\'ve implemented an EXPLODING SETTINGS HANDLER
2016-07-20T11:13:33 <Bosmon> https://gist.github.com/amb26/4899d172aaf31fa0ba849f433ced0a17
2016-07-20T11:14:05 <Bosmon> It\'s ok to stick the solutions registry onto the payload, and no real need to remove iot
2016-07-20T11:14:06 <Bosmon> it
2016-07-20T11:14:18 <Bosmon> Under "megapayloadism" we tend to consider the megapayload to be immutable
2016-07-20T11:19:59 <kasparne_> Bosmon: keeping the full solutions registry attached though, I ran into an issue with payload size
2016-07-20T11:20:06 <kasparne_> sec
2016-07-20T11:20:48 <kasparne_> https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-1880
2016-07-20T11:20:53 <kasparne_> there it is
2016-07-20T11:30:40 <kasparne_> Bosmon: ^
2016-07-20T11:32:11 <kasparne_> oops - sorry - just saw your comment on the JIRA

2016-07-20T12:08:47 <Bosmon> kasparnet - do you remember a JIRA about faults relating to trying to logout too quickly after a login, or while a login is still in progress?
2016-07-20T12:09:03 <Bosmon> I realised that this is a huge class of problem that our current system is open to
2016-07-20T12:09:59 <kasparnet> hmmm.. I can do a bit of digging -- I remember issues related to that, but I think it was actually the other way around - logging in too quickly after logging out
2016-07-20T12:10:07 <kasparnet> which screwed up read write gold
2016-07-20T12:10:11 <kasparnet> that took a while to shut down
2016-07-20T12:12:29 <kasparnet> Bosmon: I cant find any JIRAs
2016-07-20T12:12:39 <kasparnet> but it\'s a good point, that it\'s a big issue
2016-07-20T12:12:55 <Bosmon> Yes, the opposite could easily be a problem too
2016-07-20T12:13:12 <Bosmon> It really requires a fundamentally different architecture than the one we\'ve got

2016-07-20T12:27:16 <kasparnet> Bosmon: I would have expected it to be a lot simpler ... I guess we would need to know when settings are applied/applications are launched, but once we know that, howcome it\'s not just a matter of checking that we\'re done with logging in/out before attempting to do another log in/out?
2016-07-20T12:37:54 <Bosmon> kasparnet - sure
2016-07-20T12:38:03 <Bosmon> Let\'s think on this a bit : P
2016-07-20T12:38:15 <Bosmon> Say we discover that we are *not* done with logging in/out
2016-07-20T12:38:18 <Bosmon> What should we do then?
2016-07-20T12:46:03 <kasparnet> we should respond to the login request with some appropriate error code
2016-07-20T12:46:07 <kasparnet> and text
