2016-11-01T13:40:50 <cindyli> gtirloni: i tried ur fix for yesterday\'s problem. seems the problem is still there. is it enough to make sure i get the fix pulled in by running "vagrant destroy; vagrant up"?
2016-11-01T13:43:54 * the-t-in-rtf has quit
2016-11-01T13:46:22 <gtirloni> cindyli: yes. so you did destroy; tests; halt; up; tests.. and that failed after the reboot?
2016-11-01T13:46:56 <cindyli> yes, that\'s what i did. right, still failed
2016-11-01T13:47:33 <gtirloni> without deleting node_modules, right?
2016-11-01T13:48:58 <gtirloni> cindyli: what\'s the output of "vagrant ssh -c \'cat /etc/fstab\'" in your case?
2016-11-01T13:50:14 <cindyli> gtirloni: the output - http://pastebin.com/xLdnyAfd
2016-11-01T13:51:09 <gtirloni> ok, thanks. i\'ll investigate that

2016-11-01T13:59:16 <gtirloni> cindyli: could you try this? vagrant up; vagrant ssh -c "touch /home/vagrant/sync/node_modules/universal/node_modules/inside.txt"; touch ./node_modules/outside.txt; then reboot (vagrant halt/up or reload) and check again if the inside/outside.txt files are there?
2016-11-01T13:59:31 <gtirloni> from your repo\'s dir
2016-11-01T13:59:37 <cindyli> ok

2016-11-01T14:13:19 <cindyli> gtirloni: after the reboot, both inside.txt and outside.txt are there with the same timestamp as before the reboot
2016-11-01T14:13:42 <gtirloni> but one is only seen on the VM and the other only on the host?
2016-11-01T14:14:42 <cindyli> gtirloni: Just checked. they are both can been seen inside and outside the VM
2016-11-01T14:15:13 <gtirloni> looks like the split node_modules mount wasn\'t up when you created those files. interesting.

2016-11-01T14:26:55 * avtar joined the channel
2016-11-01T14:30:20 <cindyli> gtirloni: do i need to add "-f" with "vagrant destroy"? i always ran it without "-f"
2016-11-01T14:31:07 <gtirloni> cindyli: -f will just skip the prompt, no needed. it looks like the issue now is that the bind mount is happening before the vbox shared folder is ready.. i\'m trying to find a way to reorder that
2016-11-01T14:31:16 <cindyli> ok
2016-11-01T14:31:25 <cindyli> cool u figured something out

2016-11-01T15:18:55 <Justin_o> alanharnum: http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/RendererDecorators.html#identify-decorator
2016-11-01T15:20:22 <Justin_o> it looks like you could use that to get the ID of an element from the renderer tree. You\'d probably need to setup an afterRender handler to apply the aria-labelledby attribute to the inputs
2016-11-01T15:21:05 <Justin_o> you could also explore using the attr render decorator, but i\'m not sure if the idMap is accessible from within the tree

2016-11-01T15:31:37 <alanharnum> Justin_o: this appears to work: https://gist.github.com/waharnum/4332b1e6eea4d8782164ae1b7a763408
2016-11-01T15:32:13 <Justin_o> alanharnum: that\'s going to be dangerous if you have more than one of them on the page
2016-11-01T15:32:23 <alanharnum> true
2016-11-01T15:32:33 <Justin_o> if you\'re going to do something like that, you\'d probably want to use fluid.allocateSimpleId if possible
2016-11-01T15:33:13 <alanharnum> it\'s a question of getting the ID generated on the renderer-based component (the panel) to a non-renderer based component (the textfieldSliders)
2016-11-01T15:33:17 <alanharnum> i\'ll take a look at it after standup
2016-11-01T15:40:28 * Sitesh joined the channel
2016-11-01T15:41:37 <Sitesh> Hello guys and mentors , Sitesh here . I am very interested to contribute to this project, can anybody help me how to start ?
2016-11-01T15:52:27 <gtirloni> cindyli: for now, just run `vagrant ssh -c \'sudo mount -a\'` after you reboot/start the machine.. i\'m working on a proper workaround for this ("proper workaround" is awesome).
2016-11-01T15:52:46 <cindyli> cool. thanks, gtirloni
2016-11-01T15:53:44 <cindyli> welcome Sitesh. what is your background? are you interested in contributing code or design?
2016-11-01T15:54:23 * alanharnum joined the channel
2016-11-01T15:54:58 <cindyli> Sitesh: this wiki page describes how to contribute on either of those: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Get+Involved#GetInvolved-ContributingCode
2016-11-01T15:58:20 <cindyli> gtirloni: the workaround doesn\'t seem to work. still hitting errors after "vagrant up; vagrant ssh -c \'sudo mount -a\'"
2016-11-01T15:59:19 <cindyli> gtirloni: we have another workaround that is to do "vagrant destroy" before the vagrant reboot
2016-11-01T16:00:06 <gtirloni> that obliterates the box and starts from scratch.. you could also run `vagrant provision` to save some time
2016-11-01T16:01:17 <gtirloni> we are working around too many issues, i\'m out of ideas now (we may need a \'workaround compatibility matrix\'). i\'m trying to create a service that will watch for when the shared folder comes up, and then do the bind mount.. but it\'s going to take a few hours to get it ready for testing

2016-11-01T16:04:57 <Justin_o> jhung: what was it that you wanted reviewed? and would it be better for danayo or I to do it?
2016-11-01T16:10:03 <Bosmon> Hi gtirloni, cindyli - on https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2060 you have said "I have committed a fix for this issue" - where has it been committed?
2016-11-01T16:10:12 <jhung> either Justin_o or danayo. It\'s just an added link to the index page of the guide site to the print file.
2016-11-01T16:10:24 <gtirloni> Bosmon: to github.com/idi-ops/ansible-nodejs .. it doesn\'t fix the issue, sorry.
2016-11-01T16:11:17 <jhung> if you don\'t have time Justin_o, I can pair w danayo on it.
2016-11-01T16:11:29 <Bosmon> gtirloni - cheers, not to worry
2016-11-01T16:11:34 <Bosmon> I\'m sure we\'ll crack it : P
2016-11-01T16:11:44 <Justin_o> jhung: I have some time now. I can take a look at it. danayo did you want to see how it looks first though, or are you okay with me merging if things seem alright?
2016-11-01T16:13:05 <Justin_o> jhung: is idg-print.css supposed to be minified?
2016-11-01T16:13:05 <cindyli> Bosmon: all your comments on my GPII ouchdb pull request has been addressed - https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/464, ready for more reviews.
2016-11-01T16:13:15 <Bosmon> cindyli - apart from the fact we can\'t build it?
2016-11-01T16:13:28 <Justin_o> jhung: i suppose it is, but want to double check
2016-11-01T16:13:44 <cindyli> Bosmon: we can, just have to run "vagrant destroy" before each "vagrant up"
2016-11-01T16:13:51 <Bosmon> !!!
2016-11-01T16:14:23 <cindyli> the issue was the 2nd time when rebooting the same vagrant to run tests again
2016-11-01T16:14:38 <danayo> jhung, Justin_o: it looks like this, right? https://jhung.github.io/guide.inclusivedesign.ca/
2016-11-01T16:14:59 <jhung> danayo: yeah. Let me know if that looks okay.
2016-11-01T16:15:10 <cindyli> i think that\'s why the pull request can pass the CI \'cuz CI builds a fresh vagrant each time, Bosmon
2016-11-01T16:15:20 <jhung> I don\'t think I minified that css Justin_o.
2016-11-01T16:15:32 <Bosmon> cindyli - ok - I\'m trying to grasp from the logs above what kind of issue we have
2016-11-01T16:16:38 <cindyli> Bosmon: i hope gtirloni and my last comments on https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/464 explain the problem. If not, we should fix comments first :)
2016-11-01T16:16:39 <Justin_o> jhung: it seems minified in the diff
2016-11-01T16:16:49 <Justin_o> jhung: also, we may want to talk about this https://github.com/phetsims/john-travoltage/issues/125
2016-11-01T16:19:07 <Bosmon> cindyli - I see the comments, yes
2016-11-01T16:19:16 <Bosmon> But they still don\'t quite shed light on "what kind of problem we have" : P
2016-11-01T16:19:34 <danayo> jhung: I think that looks fine. If I was going to get picky, I\'d say let\'s move it over to the right a bit more (so the R margin is same as the top margin)
2016-11-01T16:19:34 <Bosmon> Well ok
2016-11-01T16:19:39 <Bosmon> I guess we do understand what we have
2016-11-01T16:19:40 <cindyli> Bosmon: seems i do need to fix the comment ;)
2016-11-01T16:19:53 <Bosmon> The issue is just that gtirloni\'s fix doesn\'t have the effect that we know we need?
2016-11-01T16:20:06 <Bosmon> That is, of persisting the binding across reboots?
2016-11-01T16:20:10 <cindyli> yes
2016-11-01T16:20:12 <Bosmon> ok
2016-11-01T16:20:41 <cindyli> i will add your brilliant summary line into the comment
2016-11-01T16:21:37 <Justin_o> danayo, jhung: it doesn\'t seem to line up with the margin of the content either.
2016-11-01T16:22:22 <jhung> Justin_o: yeah. it\'s outside of the content container. i can fix that.
2016-11-01T16:23:19 <danayo> jhung Justin_o: since it\'s not part of the content, i don\'t think it needs to line up with the rest of the content
2016-11-01T16:23:35 <danayo> i like it tucked away in the corner a bit
2016-11-01T16:24:13 <Justin_o> danayo, jhung: also the print document seems to be missing the logo at the bottom left
2016-11-01T16:26:24 <Justin_o> danayo: want to join a call with Jon and I in my vidyo room?
