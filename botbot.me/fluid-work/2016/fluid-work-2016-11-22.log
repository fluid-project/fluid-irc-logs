2016-11-22T19:03:23 <lliskovoi> *Don\'t think we ended up scheduling anything last week
2016-11-22T19:03:29 <colinclark> no, we didn\'t
2016-11-22T19:03:37 <colinclark> when works for you, ewbjr?
2016-11-22T19:05:06 <ewbjr> we\'re working on the vidyo.io stuff at the moment and I\'d love to have that hooked up when we meet, would thursday/friday work for you both?
2016-11-22T19:05:22 <lliskovoi> either one works for me
2016-11-22T19:05:48 <colinclark> lemme check
2016-11-22T19:06:08 <colinclark> Looks like I\'m free in the afternoon on Thursday
2016-11-22T19:06:28 <colinclark> but preferable in the noon-1 pm timeslot
2016-11-22T19:06:50 <lliskovoi> I can do that
2016-11-22T19:11:06 <colinclark> ewbjr: ^
2016-11-22T19:11:26 <ewbjr> that works for me, perfect

2016-11-22T19:14:55 <lliskovoi> great, talk to you then. ewbjr is what you have so far ready for accessibility testing before the meeting?
2016-11-22T19:17:43 <ewbjr> lliskovoi: yes, ill send you a link to the most recent version, we were going back and forth with the accordians too because of spacing on smaller screens like my surface
2016-11-22T19:19:03 <lliskovoi> thanks! I\'ll have a look and we can chat about it on Thursday.
2016-11-22T19:27:58 <cindyli> Bosmon, Bosmon5, are you good with the-t-in-rtf\'s gpii-pouchdb change to hide the pouch error? if yes, i will update my ouchdb pull request

2016-11-22T20:25:04 <kavya> i see following message on browser: message":"Failure to read settings for handler gpii.windows.spiSettingsHandler as written after 12 retries"
2016-11-22T20:26:07 <kavya> can anyone help me understand this error message?
2016-11-22T20:29:10 <cindyli> Bosmon, Bosmon5, the ouchdb pull request has been updated. 409 errors are no longer shown at running acceptance tests.
2016-11-22T20:31:29 <Bosmon> cindyli - great - I will test again!
2016-11-22T20:31:36 <cindyli> thanks, Bosmon
2016-11-22T20:32:40 <Bosmon> kavya - it may either be that the settings handling process took longer than expected, or that it failed
2016-11-22T20:32:47 <Bosmon> Did you observe the logon to take a very long time?
2016-11-22T20:33:24 <Bosmon> If you can find the console output from the GPII, you can paste this into a JIRA together with a report of what you observed and on what platform
2016-11-22T20:42:35 <kavya> login was fast and as expected
2016-11-22T20:43:42 <kavya> my understanding is in this case it should be same issue if i try to login with any persona
2016-11-22T20:45:50 <kavya> So i checked with other persona david
2016-11-22T20:46:02 <kavya> it successfully logged in and logged out
2016-11-22T20:54:13 <kavya> i will create Jira with my observations and gpii console output

2016-11-22T12:35:07 <the-t-in-rtf> @Bosmon5, @cindyli, I have spent the day investigating further and exploring a few strategies to avoid the "409" errors with gpii-pouchdb.
2016-11-22T12:36:05 <the-t-in-rtf> I had hoped that the same package that caused the problems might offer a solution, as that all-dbs package also provides a mechanism to clear all packages.  However, they have special logic for view databases and for the database that lists all databases.
2016-11-22T12:36:35 <the-t-in-rtf> Using their method appears to slightly reduce the number of 409s, but does not completely clean everything out.
2016-11-22T12:37:05 <the-t-in-rtf> I am working on another variation now.

2016-11-22T13:21:21 <the-t-in-rtf> @cindyli and @bosmon, I have updated gpii-pouchdb with a patched version of express-pouchdb
2016-11-22T13:21:43 <the-t-in-rtf> the offending log calls now use fluid.log(fluid.logLevel.TRACE, \xe2\x80\xa6)
2016-11-22T13:21:53 <the-t-in-rtf> which means we can continue to troubleshoot, but that they will not appear by default.
2016-11-22T13:22:22 <the-t-in-rtf> I will work on reproducing the problem in isolation so that we can submit a bug report and/or PR to the maintainer.
2016-11-22T13:22:38 <the-t-in-rtf> but as today is a short day, I wanted to give you a workaround.

2016-11-22T14:01:33 <Justin_o> Bosmon5, cindyli: i noticed this ( https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/commit/f3e5031adc95f9242d59efd8b8a7a89ecc5cf6bb )  went into master yesterday, was there a specific need for that to be included in the Infusion 2.0 release?
2016-11-22T14:05:49 <cindyli> Justin_o: sorry, i did it, forgot about the code freezing. i think it a nice to have feature for other repos that use fluid promise, so would be very useful for it to be in the infusion 2 release.
2016-11-22T14:06:18 <cindyli> but it may not be something must have for the infusion 2 release
2016-11-22T14:07:03 <cindyli> also, the pull is to improve fluid.promise.map() which is not used at all in the infusion itself, but instead is used by other repos that have infusion as the base framework
2016-11-22T14:07:13 <cindyli> however, it\'s still a change to the infusion core
2016-11-22T14:07:50 <Justin_o> cindyli: so a couple things 1) what needs to be tested/re-tested 2) what documentation is needed for it
2016-11-22T14:10:12 <cindyli> right, for 1, what i think that needs to be re-tested is the infusion framework auto tests. I\'ve tested that but would be nice to have another pair of eyes. Bosmon5, anything else do you think that needs to be re-tested?
2016-11-22T14:12:42 <cindyli> 2. yes, the promise API needs to be updated.
2016-11-22T14:13:53 <Justin_o> cindyli: could you please file a JIRA for the documentation that needs to be added, and make that a blocker for 2.0
2016-11-22T14:14:41 <Justin_o> Bosmon5: could you let me know as soon as possible what needs to be tested/re-tested or if it is enough to just re-run the unit tests
2016-11-22T14:15:06 <cindyli> sure, Justin_o, i can issue a pull request on docs too for Bosmon5 to review

2016-11-22T16:18:43 <kavya> Bosmon5:Hi
2016-11-22T16:19:52 <kavya> While testing..i observed the vladimir persona cannot logout and left my system in a corrupted state.
2016-11-22T16:20:21 <clown> "vlad the impaler"?
2016-11-22T16:20:29 <kavya> my question is: can we use  journaling page  to restore my system in such scenario
2016-11-22T16:24:14 <colinclark> I\'m pretty sure you can, kavya
2016-11-22T16:24:21 <colinclark> though I have to admit I have never done it myself
2016-11-22T16:24:44 <colinclark> Bosmon: ^
2016-11-22T16:25:03 <Bosmon> kavya - yes, you can
2016-11-22T16:25:47 <Bosmon> If you have the console window open from which you started the GPII, you will have seen a message scroll by at the point you logged on
2016-11-22T16:26:24 <Bosmon> This will have a message like, "You can restore the system state by visiting the following URL"
2016-11-22T16:26:48 <colinclark> what a cool feature :)
2016-11-22T16:26:49 <Bosmon> Alternatively you can see the list of all the journal files using the URL at https://github.com/GPII/universal#recovering-from-system-corruption-using-the-journal , and pick the one from closest to the time when you log on
2016-11-22T16:28:10 <michelled> wow, that\'s awesome!
2016-11-22T16:28:56 <avtar> Bosmon: very awesome :D
2016-11-22T16:29:01 <kavya> ok..so when i use jounaling page to restore..the system does not restore and the browser displays some text
2016-11-22T16:29:48 <kavya> i didn\'t know about this...that\'s awesome
2016-11-22T16:30:05 <kavya> i will check for this one too

2016-11-22T16:39:11 <kavya> stegru:thats the JIRA am looking for
2016-11-22T16:39:30 <Bosmon> I think I\'m missing part of this conversation : P
2016-11-22T16:39:37 <kavya> it is the same message it displays when i am trying to restore with the journaling
2016-11-22T16:39:45 <stegru> sorry, i just jumped in without reading

2016-11-22T16:40:08 <stegru> https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2145
2016-11-22T16:40:50 <Bosmon> Wow, fascinating
2016-11-22T16:41:18 <Bosmon> Looks like a framework or settings handler bug
2016-11-22T16:41:40 <Bosmon> But it\'s not clear with which settings handler - my guess is the .INI settings handler since that is poorly tested, and involved with NVDA
2016-11-22T16:42:45 <Bosmon> The problem is that our vagrant box doesn\'t test this functionality since it doesn\'t install any particular AT
2016-11-22T16:42:47 <kavya> i want to restore the system with journaling after logout issue with vladimir
2016-11-22T16:42:51 <Bosmon> So such things could quite easily rot
2016-11-22T16:46:46 <kavya> Is this an issue with the settings handler?
2016-11-22T16:47:27 <Bosmon> kavya - I expect so, although we will have to find out how to reproduce the problem deterministically
2016-11-22T16:47:30 <Bosmon> We really have two problems
2016-11-22T16:48:00 <Bosmon> I\'ve raised https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2160 since really the journalling system should be immune to such a problem in the settings handler, since this is, after all, precisely why it was written
2016-11-22T16:48:15 <Bosmon> But it\'s not prepared for a further failure to occur during the restore process
2016-11-22T16:48:45 <Bosmon> It would help if you could find the .json file corresponding to the snapshot that you tried to restore, and attach it to your JIRA
2016-11-22T16:49:38 <Bosmon> The GPII will report the filenames of these snapshots to the console as it starts up
2016-11-22T16:49:48 <kavya> Sure..i will add the the json file to JIRA
2016-11-22T16:50:32 <Bosmon> But in general they are in a directory like C:\\Users\\Bosmon\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\gpii where you would replace "Bosmon" with your own username
2016-11-22T16:51:58 <kavya> ok.Thanks Bosmon..
