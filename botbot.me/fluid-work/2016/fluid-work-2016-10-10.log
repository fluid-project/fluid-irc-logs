2016-10-10T11:35:46 <the-t-in-rtf> Hi, All.  Can someone with access assign this to @Bosmon?  https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/761
2016-10-10T11:35:57 <the-t-in-rtf> He asked me to submit it....
2016-10-10T11:36:18 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - don\'t worry, assigning PRs to me has very little informational value :)
2016-10-10T11:36:22 <Bosmon> You can be sure I\'ll look at it
2016-10-10T11:36:52 <the-t-in-rtf> I was also going to ping you, but for whatever reason your new arrangement doesn\'t always appear to be online in IM (at least from my computer).
2016-10-10T11:37:23 <Bosmon> Well, I\'m often reduced to having Google Chat running in a browser window
2016-10-10T11:37:29 <Bosmon> I don\'t know what model that uses for determining my status
2016-10-10T11:37:38 <the-t-in-rtf> ad revenue per hour
2016-10-10T11:43:42 <the-t-in-rtf> OK, I will prepare a companion commit/PR for gpii-binder to remove its old copies of the transforms and we can time-lock the merging so that I can pick up a new version and replace the git hash.

2016-10-10T12:55:38 <the-t-in-rtf1> OK, @bosmon, I referenced this copiously in various comments, but here is the complimentary PR to remove the new infusion transforms from their old home:  https://github.com/GPII/gpii-binder/pull/5

2016-10-10T15:17:25 <gtirloni> amatas: hi! have you seen this error when working with the windows box lately? http://pastebin.com/raw/hFNu1S3G
2016-10-10T15:17:43 * the-t-in-rtf joined the channel
2016-10-10T15:20:33 <amatas> gtirloni, "error MSB4126: The specified solution configuration "Release|X86" is invalid"
2016-10-10T15:20:48 <amatas> yup, I\'ve seen this before
2016-10-10T15:21:36 <amatas> If I remember well I solved it using the parameter /p:Platform="Any CPU" or something like that
2016-10-10T15:25:29 <amatas> I think that there is a confusion between some MSBuild versions which use "Win32" instead "x86" or the other way around.
2016-10-10T15:26:07 <gtirloni> thanks. it\'s interesting since the windows CI just passed 16h ago, but I can\'t `vagrant up` GPII/windows\' master branch
2016-10-10T15:27:49 <gtirloni> but I guess it must be some PR which contains fixes

2016-10-10T15:29:28 <amatas> gtirloni, I only faced that error when I tried to recreate the build steps in a clean VM to run GPII/Windows
2016-10-10T15:35:15 <jhernandez> gtirloni: I did "vagrant up" on last Thursday/Friday
2016-10-10T15:35:17 <jhernandez> JFYI
2016-10-10T15:35:35 <jhernandez> let me check now
2016-10-10T15:37:58 <jhernandez> gtirloni: https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2003
2016-10-10T15:39:22 <jhernandez> pull again from master, the fix was merged on Thursday
2016-10-10T16:04:56 <gtirloni> it worked, thank you!

2016-10-10T16:32:08 <amatas> has anyone seen these errors before when Fluid\'s tests run in Firefox 49? http://pastie.org/pastes/10940974/text?key=seohklnk6fautgkxpp6usa
2016-10-10T16:32:45 <amatas> it\'s a bit odd because it only happens when they run in a VM
2016-10-10T16:37:37 <gtirloni> amatas: i have had many \'random\' errors that turned out to be me stealing the focus of the browser while the tests were running
2016-10-10T16:41:36 <amatas> gtirloni, that is!
2016-10-10T16:42:07 <amatas> But how to steal the focus during a test step
2016-10-10T16:51:14 <gtirloni> i think there\'s no way around this, the tests depend on the browser state.. but i don\'t know a lot about them. i just don\'t touch anything while tests are running here :)
2016-10-10T17:10:20 <amatas> same here, I only interact with the VMs through vagrant commands
