b'2016-11-10T16:54:55 <simonjb> and this morning I\'m making an infusion version using Colin\'s infusion wrapper for node-midi
2016-11-10T16:56:09 <simonjb> I have it working using setTimeout and was asking Justin_o if we had an infusion abstraction for recurring processes (such as polling)
2016-11-10T17:08:39 <simonjb> Bosmon5 (and Bosmon2 and Bosmon7): I\'ve just pushed up my very much work-in-progress Infusion monitor: https://github.com/simonbates/nexus-experiments/blob/master/monitorMidiPortsFlocking.js
2016-11-10T17:12:15 <Bosmon5> simonjb - cool
2016-11-10T17:13:12 <Bosmon5> simonjb - some related work is klown\'s "processes bridge" - https://github.com/klown/universal/blob/GPII-442/gpii/node_modules/processReporter/src/processesBridge.js#L301
2016-11-10T17:13:43 <Bosmon5> I think this branch contains more work than will get into core on the current round, but it would be great if the two of you could collaborate on a shared utility that you found useful
2016-11-10T17:14:46 <simonjb> will take a look, thanks Bosmon5
2016-11-10T17:15:28 <michelled> stegru: have you noticed that logging out alice no longer closes the onscreen keyboard?
2016-11-10T17:16:01 <stegru> yes i have, i\'m looking into this now
2016-11-10T17:16:45 <stegru> oh this is fixed in 2073
2016-11-10T17:17:13 <stegru> but there\'s another similar problem with it, michelled
2016-11-10T17:17:39 <michelled> ok, good to know. I won\'t worry about it then :)
2016-11-10T17:20:02 <simonjb> clown: ^ see above chat with Bosmon5 regarding your "process bridge" and recurring processes in Infusion
2016-11-10T17:20:26 <simonjb> starting 11:54
2016-11-10T17:21:44 * clown looking simonjb
2016-11-10T17:26:59 <kavya> Stegru: logging out not closing on screen keyboard is fixed with 2073?
2016-11-10T17:27:18 <stegru> yes, kavya
2016-11-10T17:28:07 <kavya> ok..i just created JIRA for this
2016-11-10T17:28:34 <kavya> can i test with new installer build?
2016-11-10T17:29:09 <stegru> oh it\'s not merged in yet, there\'s still another problem with it
2016-11-10T17:29:10 * clown has quit
2016-11-10T17:30:13 <kavya> ok.. i reassign JIRA to me and update the status
2016-11-10T17:30:49 <kavya> I also abserved logging in with elod does not turn on magnifier with 200% zoom
2016-11-10T17:32:12 <Justin_o> michelled, simonjb: If you run "npm show infusion versions" from the command line, it will show all available versions for infusion in NPM
2016-11-10T17:32:24 <michelled> ah, great Justin_o
2016-11-10T17:32:25 <Justin_o> currently they\'re all 2.0.0 dev versions
2016-11-10T17:34:03 <michelled> soon, Justin_o, soon :)
2016-11-10T17:34:12 <simonjb> :)
2016-11-10T17:35:25 <stegru> ok kavya, I don\'t know that

2016-11-10T19:03:25 <Justin_o> jhung, cindyli: could you please take a look at and review this PR for the uploader https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/783

2016-11-10T19:24:39 * alanharn_ joined the channel
2016-11-10T19:33:19 <Bosmon5> alanharn_, cindyli - ok so I\'m thoroughly confused about what is going on with with the "readOnlyGrade" pouchDB situation
2016-11-10T19:33:46 <Bosmon5> SO - to start with, how did alanharn_ manage to consume gpii.dataSource.pouchDB without also consuming the grade linkage definition that goes with it?
2016-11-10T19:34:22 <alanharn_> Bosmon5: i\'m not sure - I was just experimentally working to use cindyli\'s datasource definition (entirely in-browser)
2016-11-10T19:34:26 * alanharn_ is now known as alanharnum
2016-11-10T19:34:37 <alanharnum> the file i\'m using definitely has the grade linkage definition
2016-11-10T19:35:13 <Bosmon5> ok
2016-11-10T19:35:27 <alanharnum> but I found without adding an appropriate readOnlyGrade, setting writeable: true in my use of the datasource resulted in the issue described
2016-11-10T19:35:40 <Bosmon5> Ok
2016-11-10T19:35:52 <Bosmon5> So I wonder why cindyli claims that the linkage makes the option unnecessary
2016-11-10T19:36:45 <Bosmon5> alanharnum - can you put your usage code in a pastie or so?
2016-11-10T19:39:08 <cindyli> alanharnum, Bosmon5, probably \'cuz my "gpii.dataSource.pouchDB.writable" component doesn\'t have writeable: true. so, i might be mistaken on when "writeable" is used
2016-11-10T19:39:48 <cindyli> a piece of code in kettle that computes writable grade at writeable: true - https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/blob/master/lib/dataSource-core.js#L187-L198
2016-11-10T19:40:42 <cindyli> from its comment, the "linkage" may not be works when writeable is true
2016-11-10T19:40:46 <cindyli> working
2016-11-10T19:41:03 <Bosmon5> writeable:true is intended to be the user configuration
2016-11-10T19:41:16 <Bosmon5> gpii.dataSource.pouchDB.writable etc. is the implementation which backs the configuration
2016-11-10T19:41:17 <alanharnum> cindyli: if writeable: true is not set, it doesn\'t have a set method at all
2016-11-10T19:42:24 <alanharnum> let me push my code up - it\'s broken in various ways right now, but broken differently depending on whether or not the correct readonlyGrade is present, or writable: true is set
2016-11-10T19:42:25 <Bosmon5> cindyli - OK, I see the problem now
2016-11-10T19:42:27 <Bosmon5> https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/GPII-1274/gpii/node_modules/gpii-oauth2/gpii-oauth2-datastore/test/js/DataSource-PouchDBTests.js#L249
2016-11-10T19:42:33 <Bosmon5> Your test here is broadcasting the implementation-level grade
2016-11-10T19:42:55 <Bosmon5> So really you should adjust the test to reflect the real usage of the grade, and instead broadcast the flag "writable: true"
2016-11-10T19:43:04 <Bosmon5> This will then enable you to test the definition which alanharnum asked you to insert
2016-11-10T19:43:37 <Bosmon5> I admit this is a somewhat wacky system, but it is one of the remnants in Kettle that we have inherited from yzen :)
2016-11-10T19:44:24 <alanharnum> Bosmon5: https://github.com/waharnum/myl3/blob/FLOE-471-gpiiPouch/src/js/pouchPersisted.js
2016-11-10T19:44:24 <Bosmon5> Because we don\'t yet have a clear way to remove or override particular grades in a component, it seemed reasonable to leave this stone around for us to stub our toe on from time to time to remind us ........
2016-11-10T19:44:38 <alanharnum> Bosmon5: consider my toe stubbed :)
2016-11-10T19:45:05 <Bosmon5> Although I can\'t imagine that the use case where a further author wants to make a dataSource read-only that a previous one had needed to be writable is actually realistic
2016-11-10T19:45:06 <alanharnum> i was baffled as to what was happening until I put in the roughly 1 million console.log statements you can see in that branch
2016-11-10T19:45:38 <alanharnum> which probably says as much about my ability to trace code flow as anything else :P
2016-11-10T19:45:44 <Bosmon5> But this is the extra affordance of having a flag rather than simply relying on grade content
2016-11-10T19:46:12 <Bosmon5> I guess there\'s also the fact that we don\'t need to advertise specially for each grade hierarchy how to make a writable variant of it
2016-11-10T19:46:31 <cindyli> i guess the the implementation-level grade you meant is "gpii.dataSource.pouchDB". when you said "reflect the real usage of the grade", which one is "the grade", and what\'s "the real usage"?
2016-11-10T19:46:36 <cindyli> Bosmon5:
2016-11-10T19:46:37 <cindyli> ^
2016-11-10T19:46:58 <Bosmon5> But in practice, I think our existing convention for this is going to work fine - of appending ".writable" to the original grade name
2016-11-10T19:47:05 <Bosmon5> Given this IS what the implementation does
2016-11-10T19:47:26 <Bosmon5> cindyli - the current expected usage is that the end user will supply "writable:true" rather than manually supplying the gpii.dataSource.pouchDB.writable grade
2016-11-10T19:47:51 <Bosmon5> Although this experience is exposing how somewhat silly this expected usage is
2016-11-10T19:48:09 <alanharnum> cindyli: I think Bosmon5 is referring to the documented use of dataSources in Kettle, which directs an implementor to use writable: true so that "a set method will be fabricated for this dataSource \xe2\x80\x93 otherwise, it will implement only a get method"
2016-11-10T19:48:16 <Bosmon5> Oh yes
2016-11-10T19:48:17 <Bosmon5> That\'s right
2016-11-10T19:48:24 <Bosmon5> the documented use : P
2016-11-10T19:48:29 <cindyli> ah, ok.
2016-11-10T19:48:29 <Bosmon5> Always helpful to remember that we have documentation :)
2016-11-10T19:48:39 <alanharnum> https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/blob/master/docs/DataSources.md#configuration-options-accepted-by-kettledatasourceurl :)
2016-11-10T19:48:48 <Bosmon5> There IS another reason for this rather than "re-overrideability"
2016-11-10T19:49:09 <alanharnum> I can see a rationale for setting writeable: true or writeable: false based on something like context-awareness
2016-11-10T19:49:11 <Bosmon5> I guess in time there will be a Kettle 2.0 where this mess is straightened out
2016-11-10T19:49:24 <alanharnum> i.e. is the user logged in or not, are they an admin-class user, etc
2016-11-10T19:49:25 <Bosmon5> alanharnum - can you flesh out this rationale?
2016-11-10T19:49:28 <Bosmon5> Aha
2016-11-10T19:49:34 <alanharnum> ^
2016-11-10T19:49:34 <Bosmon5> Yes, ok
2016-11-10T19:49:40 <Bosmon5> Ok then
2016-11-10T19:50:05 <Bosmon5> So the immediate resolution is for cindyli to fix up her test case, and for us to collectively remember how we stubbed our collective toe on this .....
2016-11-10T19:51:28 <alanharnum> if we\'re looking for a silver lining i understand datasources much better now :)
2016-11-10T19:55:35 <Bosmon5> As a general roadmap - the pattern that we have for the set/get methods within DataSources will eventually become a core primitive within Infusion
2016-11-10T19:56:18 <Bosmon5> Whether we call it "chains" or some other thing - but the idea that there is a linked "pseudoevent plus method" which cooperate via a "transforming promise chain"
2016-11-10T19:56:31 <Bosmon5> This is something that\'s come up a lot in our PouchDB work with the-t-in-rtf etc.
2016-11-10T19:57:01 <Bosmon5> And at that point we will take the opportunity to clean up and remove the special status of setImpl and getImpl which will just become another part of the implementation

2016-11-10T20:53:43 <cindyli> yes, Justin_o, has a quick look. what about the file deletion issue that jhung found
2016-11-10T20:54:59 <Justin_o> cindyli: not an implementation bug. Perhaps a design bug though. You need to use the "Delete" or "Del" key to delete. There was some confusion on that
2016-11-10T20:55:13 <cindyli> ah ok

2016-11-10T13:30:43 <Bosmon5> So hey stegru
2016-11-10T13:30:48 <Bosmon5> About GPII-2073
2016-11-10T13:30:53 <stegru> yes
2016-11-10T13:30:58 <Bosmon5> i) yes I did apply the universal patch and ii) I did log on as a normal user
2016-11-10T13:31:30 <stegru> ok i\'ll see if i get the same
2016-11-10T13:31:45 <Bosmon5> But what I see is a) for elod it never fails at all (normal or admin) b) for alice I can\'t get the osk to start as a normal user at all
2016-11-10T13:32:15 <Bosmon5> That is b) as a normal user, both master and your branch fail to start the OSK
2016-11-10T13:32:40 <Bosmon5> stegru - is it right that as far as you are concerned, the issue is Windows 8.1 only?
2016-11-10T13:33:13 <stegru> yes, the osk is windows only
2016-11-10T13:33:17 <stegru> i mean, windows 8
2016-11-10T13:33:35 <Bosmon5> That is the "return on lock screen" is Windows 8 only?
2016-11-10T13:33:39 <stegru> that\'s the 32bit on 64bit issue
2016-11-10T13:33:45 <Bosmon5> !
2016-11-10T13:33:50 <stegru> oh no, lock screen was for both
2016-11-10T13:34:13 <Bosmon5> 32 on 64.... is there a fresh variety of the 32 on 64 issue that this branch patches?
2016-11-10T13:34:53 <stegru> yes the fix for 2073 also fixes the 32/64 issue
2016-11-10T13:35:00 <Bosmon5> ok
2016-11-10T13:35:05 <stegru> well, it doesn\'t "fix" it, it caters for it
2016-11-10T13:35:09 <stegru> (it\'s already fixed)
2016-11-10T13:35:16 <Bosmon5> Ok
2016-11-10T13:35:52 <stegru> so.. the problem you\'re having is it still reappears at the lock screen?
2016-11-10T13:35:57 <Bosmon5> No
2016-11-10T13:36:03 <Bosmon5> I\'ve never seen it reappear at the lock screen
2016-11-10T13:36:08 <Bosmon5> Because as a normal user, it never starts
2016-11-10T13:36:11 <stegru> ohhh!
2016-11-10T13:36:18 <Bosmon5> Instead I get a dialog box saying "Cannot start on-screen keyboard"
2016-11-10T13:36:36 <stegru> ah yes, that\'s the 32/64bit issue
2016-11-10T13:36:37 <Bosmon5> Which is sort of what I remember from the old days
2016-11-10T13:36:39 <Bosmon5> Right
2016-11-10T13:36:51 <Bosmon5> Only now I\'m only seeing it when logged on as a normal user
2016-11-10T13:36:56 <Bosmon5> As an admin user everything works fine
2016-11-10T13:37:03 <Bosmon5> Including not seeing it reappear
2016-11-10T13:37:30 <stegru> what os are you getting the "cannot start" error on? win8?
2016-11-10T13:37:43 <Bosmon5> All of this is with our standard Win 10 vagrant box
2016-11-10T13:37:50 <Bosmon5> Which I believe is 32-bit node on 64-bit OS
2016-11-10T13:38:37 <stegru> ok well, i need to look into it some more, then
2016-11-10T13:39:20 <stegru> so the problem is you\'re unable to test the lock-screen because the osk won\'t start?
2016-11-10T13:40:23 <Bosmon5> stegru - exactly
2016-11-10T13:40:41 <stegru> ok

2016-11-10T14:28:03 <cindyli> Bosmon2, Bosmon5, Bosmon7, thanks for catching my silly mistake on not actually using fluid-resolve. :) all comments addressed and ready for another look - https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/464

2016-11-10T14:50:01 <cindyli> thanks, Bosmon5
2016-11-10T14:50:12 <Bosmon5> michelled, stegru, gloob, others - did we decide we\'d have a Windows meeting today?
2016-11-10T14:50:49 <stegru> well, i don\'t have much to say
2016-11-10T14:56:00 <jhernandez> Bosmon5: fine for me if we skip it for this time

2016-11-10T15:20:20 <Justin_o> simonjb: this is the function i was thinking of, https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/core/js/Fluid.js#L48-L54 but it doesn\'t seem configurable, so may not be useful for your case.
2016-11-10T15:20:45 <simonjb> thanks Justin_o

2016-11-10T16:18:11 <Bosmon5> Justin_o - what did you want to do with fluid.invokeLater?
2016-11-10T16:22:31 * Jess_ has quit
2016-11-10T16:23:44 <kavya> what is the expected behavior of GPII if the user close GPII running application without logging out ?
2016-11-10T16:24:39 <michelled> we should ask Bern to hang out here - that would be a good question for him :)
2016-11-10T16:24:55 <michelled> jhernandez, kasparne_: any thoughts? ^
2016-11-10T16:25:34 <kasparne_> I would say it should log any currently logged in users out
2016-11-10T16:26:21 <kavya> So the user should logout and any preferences should restore
2016-11-10T16:26:25 <michelled> I suppose I wonder why they are closing GPII. it does seem like the intention would be to log out
2016-11-10T16:26:56 <kavya> Yes..the user should logout
2016-11-10T16:27:19 <kavya> what if the user forgets to logout and close the gpii
2016-11-10T16:28:14 <kavya> it is just the scenario to know how GPII should work
2016-11-10T16:28:47 <Justin_o> Bosmon5: nothing in particular. simonjb was asking if we had any recurring timer functions in Infusion. I was just saying that was the only thing I knew of in the framework that was related to timing. And that there was an example of a timer used in the progress demo as well.
2016-11-10T16:28:53 <michelled> yes and I\'m trying to understand when it would occur so that we do something logical
2016-11-10T16:29:48 <kavya> yes..in this case closing GPII should log out user and system should restore
2016-11-10T16:29:59 <michelled> yeah, that makes the most sense
2016-11-10T16:30:00 <michelled> :)
2016-11-10T16:30:54 <kavya> yes..i see closing gpii now is not logging out user and i can see preferences still on like magnifier and keyboard

2016-11-10T16:40:04 <Bosmon5> Justin_o - no, no recurring timer functions in Infusion
2016-11-10T16:40:24 <Bosmon5> Although we now do have stegru\'s new utility
2016-11-10T16:41:29 <Bosmon5> https://github.com/stegru/windows/blob/GPII-2073/gpii/node_modules/WindowsUtilities/WindowsUtilities.js#L698
2016-11-10T16:41:46 <Bosmon5> If there\'s any interest, we\'ll elevate this into Infusion since it\'s of pretty general utility
2016-11-10T16:41:51 <Bosmon5> What\'s your use case, simonjb ?
2016-11-10T16:44:07 <jhernandez> michelled: sorry, just seen this
2016-11-10T16:44:40 <jhernandez> I think that if the user "quits the GPII" the system should be restored to its original state (this is, logging out)
2016-11-10T16:46:53 <Bosmon5> Sounds like a nice theory
2016-11-10T16:46:59 <Bosmon5> And looks like it would be easy enough to implement
2016-11-10T16:47:01 <Bosmon5> https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/pull/1/files#diff-7a9076d6d94e62c13d641aa71f19ae8eR176

2016-11-10T16:54:07 <simonjb> Bosmon5: I\'m implementing a monitor to watch for connection of MIDI devices and it looks like I need to poll for devices
2016-11-10T16:54:23 <simonjb> yesterday I wrote a simple monitor using node-midi directly: https://github.com/simonbates/nexus-experiments/blob/master/monitorMidiPorts.js
