2016-06-29T17:47:42 <danayo> cindyli, lliskovoi : can you tell me what the status of Achecker is? I see there hasn't been any work on it in a couple of years. Is it still something we recommend using? I noticed it's not listed on our Learning Web A11y page. Someone was just asking me about it
2016-06-29T17:48:22 <lliskovoi> not sure danayo, I don't use it

2016-06-29T14:03:16 <the-t-in-rtf> NM, I noticed the PP on the list but missed the wiki part.
2016-06-29T14:03:18 <the-t-in-rtf> So-rry.
2016-06-29T14:03:25 <avtar> no worries :)
2016-06-29T14:04:08 <the-t-in-rtf> @avtar, once the dust settles we should catch up, say next week.  I figured out a few of the oddities with my builds and put in some new tickets.
2016-06-29T14:04:37 <gtirloni> the-t-in-rtf, we need alfredo for the dust to settle. do you know if he\'s around? not a lot we (idrc) can do about it at this moment.
2016-06-29T14:06:08 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, @jhung or anyone else, where can I get the latest P4A icon font?
2016-06-29T14:06:31 <the-t-in-rtf> I want to replace a 3rd-party icon (from an older version of foundation-icon-sets)
2016-06-29T14:06:46 <jhung> the-t-in-rtf: It\'s been a while. Let me take a look\xe2\x80\xa6
2016-06-29T14:07:15 <the-t-in-rtf> Thanks.  It has also been a while for me, I was lazily just chugging along with a 3rd party icon and it finally caught up to me.
2016-06-29T14:07:26 <the-t-in-rtf> I figured I\'d look into replacing it with something "standard" if possible.
2016-06-29T14:08:58 <jhernandez> gtirloni: sorry, just noticed that you were looking for Alfredo
2016-06-29T14:08:59 <the-t-in-rtf> @gtirloni, no idea, sorry.  I should check in with him more often.
2016-06-29T14:09:23 <jhernandez> today he flies back to Sevilla
2016-06-29T14:09:29 <avtar> the-t-in-rtf: catching up sounds great and next week works for me
2016-06-29T14:09:47 <jhernandez> but not sure by what time he\'ll be around
2016-06-29T14:10:08 <gtirloni> ok
2016-06-29T14:11:29 <jhung> danayo, sepidehshahi - as per the-t-in-rtf message above, I\'ve tried looking for an icon font for P4A and couldn\'t find one. I also looked for an AI and SVG file and didn\'t find anything. Have either of you come across a vector or font?
2016-06-29T14:12:17 <the-t-in-rtf> I googled P4A icon font and found a P4A project that is "PHP for Applications".  It burnssss.....
2016-06-29T14:16:54 <danayo> jhung, the-t-in-rtf, not sure if we created one, let me double-check with sepidehshahi
2016-06-29T14:17:32 <the-t-in-rtf> Thanks, @danayo.
2016-06-29T14:24:21 <danayo> sepidehshahi: i can only find the P4A logo image I used in the design cards - can\'t remember where it came from and it\'s not great quatliy - do you have an original? can\'t seem to find anything in dropbox or on wiki
2016-06-29T14:25:31 <simonjb> hey cindyli, do we have a good example or demo for the infusion tooltips?
2016-06-29T14:25:44 <sepidehshahi> HI danayo, let me look for it
2016-06-29T14:25:53 <danayo> thanks sepidehshahi
2016-06-29T14:29:18 <danayo> the-t-in-rtf: we are looking ... will create a font icon if we don\'t have one already and send to you
2016-06-29T14:29:54 <cindyli> simonjb: open this demo using chrome or safari, every button has a tooltip - http://build.fluidproject.org/first-discovery/demos/
2016-06-29T14:31:03 <cindyli> the source code of adding the tooltip component - https://github.com/GPII/first-discovery/blob/master/src/js/tooltip.js#L55
2016-06-29T14:31:53 <simonjb> thanks cindyli
2016-06-29T14:32:00 <cindyli> np
2016-06-29T14:33:00 <the-t-in-rtf> Thanks @danayo, I used icomoon to create a one-off stopgap, I will leave a "kill it with fire" TODO there until I hear from you.

2016-06-29T14:59:00 <jhung> sepidehshahi: is it high quality? Maybe we can trace / turn it into a vector or SVG.
2016-06-29T14:59:49 <sepidehshahi> I think Matthias, Eva or Gregg may have access to the source file since they have created the template. The one that I have used is not that high quality
2016-06-29T15:00:40 <sepidehshahi> jhung: if you are not in a hurry, I can send them an email today to find out where we can access the logo
2016-06-29T15:03:02 <jhung> I\'m not in a rush, it was the-t-in-rtf who needed it. Sounds like he has something he could use in the meantime though.
2016-06-29T15:03:06 <jhung> ^sepidehshahi
2016-06-29T15:03:29 <sepidehshahi> sure, I\xe2\x80\x99ll send out the email then jhung

2016-06-29T16:13:48 <sepidehshahi> the-t-in-rtf: the file that Carla has shared includes the vector file for P4A logo
2016-06-29T16:21:06 <sepidehshahi> I have separately saved the logo both as PDF and AI file. Here are the links: https://files.inclusivedesign.ca/s/EgOIsBSA16OSdxq

2016-06-29T16:21:46 <sepidehshahi> danayo, jhung and the-t-in-rtf ^
2016-06-29T16:22:58 <the-t-in-rtf> I was actually asking to see if there was an icon font used in various parts of the P4A project, that contained icons *other* than the P4A icon itself.
2016-06-29T16:23:20 <the-t-in-rtf> In other words, common look and feel.
2016-06-29T16:31:36 <jhernandez> clown: if you feel like I can help you with the windows process reporter just let me know
2016-06-29T16:32:11 <jhernandez> I think that we can move that function into windowsUtilities so we can use it from both killProcess and our process reporter

2016-06-29T16:33:42 <clown> jhernandez, sounds like a plan.
2016-06-29T16:33:57 <clown> Re:  help, yes, please.
2016-06-29T16:34:04 <jhernandez> clown: haha
2016-06-29T16:34:06 <jhernandez> sure
2016-06-29T16:34:34 <clown> mainly I\'m tyring to figure out how to get properties of a process.  I can get the pid.  Is there anything like a uid or gid?
2016-06-29T16:34:43 <jhung> the-t-in-rtf: ah, that\'s something completely different (although having the high quality logo is nice to have). I\'m not aware of any common font. I recall a long time ago there was a conversation about creating a common icon font, but I don\'t think that got picked up.
2016-06-29T16:34:48 <clown> we can talk after this meeting, actually.
2016-06-29T16:34:49 <jhernandez> if you want to talk more in detail we can have a quick call so I can have an idea about where are you ATM
2016-06-29T16:34:57 <jhernandez> clown: yeah, definetly
2016-06-29T16:36:34 <the-t-in-rtf> Thanks, all, sorry to have you run around for nothing.
2016-06-29T16:41:45 <jhung> the-t-in-rtf: no worries. We still got a sweet vector out of it, so it\'s all good. justin_o and I have had chats previously about creating a git repo for SVGs and then using grunt to generate fonts. This way we\'re not dependent on icomoon, and we can version control assets.
2016-06-29T16:42:53 <the-t-in-rtf> Cool, look forward to hearing about it once that\'s an option, would be happy to contribute the one icon I need\xe2\x80\xa6 ;)
2016-06-29T16:43:05 <jhung> :D
