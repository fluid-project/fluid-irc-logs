2016-01-25T14:51:51 <anastasiac> cindyli, Justin_o: I filed two pull requests on Friday, one for the video player Amara interaction, and one for the prefs framework tutorial on persistence. who do you think would be good to review those?
2016-01-25T14:52:19 <Justin_o> anastasiac: i left you a couple of comments on VP-335 this morning
2016-01-25T14:52:36 <anastasiac> ah! I should check these things before opening my mouth...
2016-01-25T14:52:36 <Justin_o> i\'m looking at your IDI-146 pull request now
2016-01-25T14:52:40 <anastasiac> :-)
2016-01-25T14:52:57 <Justin_o> anastasiac, cindyli: i haven\'t looked at the pref framework tutorial pull request though
2016-01-25T14:55:28 * alanharnum joined the channel
2016-01-25T15:03:21 <Justin_o> anastasiac: I\'ve looked over your IDI-146 pull request. It does seem to be in a better shape now despite the fact that there are still some test failures. I\'ll merge it in, but could you ensure that there are JIRAs for all the known issues.
2016-01-25T15:03:38 <anastasiac> will do, Justin_o
2016-01-25T15:03:42 <Justin_o> anastasiac: thanks
2016-01-25T15:03:51 <anastasiac> wait, Justin_o
2016-01-25T15:03:57 <Justin_o> anastasiac: okay
2016-01-25T15:04:17 <anastasiac> should I update IDI-146 with new VP code once VP-335 goes in?
2016-01-25T15:04:38 <Justin_o> anastasiac: i was going to merge IDI-146 now
2016-01-25T15:04:47 <Justin_o> would you prefer it to happen the other way around?
2016-01-25T15:05:43 <anastasiac> ah, ok, I just double-checked the scope of IDI-146; I\xe2\x80\x99m wrong, the VP upgrade shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be included

2016-01-25T15:39:49 <Justin_o> anastasiac: there were two other pull requests for IDI-146. I left comments on both of those, one is ready to be merged the other needed an update to the README, but is otherwise ready to go in.

2016-01-25T16:44:49 <Justin_o> Bosmon2: in that case I was trying to replicate the how the separate prefs panel was working with the iframe to inject a component from the parent document to the iframe
2016-01-25T16:45:12 <Justin_o> Bosmon2: although if there is an easier way, i\'d be happy to use that.
2016-01-25T16:45:28 <Justin_o> Bosmon2: it\'s really just to demonstrate the issue of the tooltip when being run across the iframe

2016-01-25T17:24:26 <anastasiac> Justin_o: The id is first added to the options: https://github.com/acheetham/videoPlayer/blob/VP-335/js/VideoPlayer.js#L465-L467  then included in the info used to build the track element: https://github.com/acheetham/videoPlayer/blob/VP-335/js/VideoPlayer_html5Captionator.js#L111

2016-01-25T19:12:56 <cindyli> anastasiac: regarding this reply: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/pull/80/files#r50739785
2016-01-25T19:13:16 <cindyli> did you generate the html via docpad and the link was ok?
2016-01-25T19:13:40 <cindyli> I was viewing the .md file directly in github, the link was without dashes.
2016-01-25T19:13:40 <anastasiac> yes, cindyli. It\xe2\x80\x99s deployed to my ghpages: http://acheetham.github.io/infusion-docs/infusion/development/SettingsStore.html#fluid-prefs-cookiestore
2016-01-25T19:14:04 <cindyli> wonder if we need to accommodate both, anastasiac?
2016-01-25T19:14:20 <anastasiac> interesting
2016-01-25T19:14:29 <anastasiac> how would we do that, cindyli?
2016-01-25T19:14:40 <cindyli> no clue :(
2016-01-25T19:16:19 <cindyli> wonder if there are settings to define the format of links, with github and docpad, so the generated urls are more predictable
2016-01-25T19:16:23 <cindyli> anastasiac: ^
2016-01-25T19:17:12 <anastasiac> cindyli: this seems like a larger issue. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t I file a JIRA for this?
2016-01-25T19:17:42 <cindyli> sure. thanks, anastasiac
2016-01-25T19:20:10 <anastasiac> cindyli: FYI: https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5850
2016-01-25T19:20:30 <cindyli> thanks, anastasiac
2016-01-25T19:22:32 <anastasiac> cindyli: docs pull request updated

2016-01-25T19:46:34 <Justin_o> cindyli: okay
2016-01-25T19:46:41 <cindyli> thanks, Justin_o
2016-01-25T20:04:57 <Justin_o> cindyli, anastasiac: I\'ve left a couple more comments on the FLUID-5804 pull request.

2016-01-25T20:47:03 <anastasiac> Justin_o: I had a question about one of your docs pull request comments
2016-01-25T20:47:11 <Justin_o> anastasiac: okay
2016-01-25T20:47:26 <Justin_o> i replied to one of your questions, was there another?
2016-01-25T20:47:46 <anastasiac> oh, sorry; needed to reload the page
2016-01-25T20:47:51 * cindyli1 joined the channel
2016-01-25T20:48:33 <anastasiac> so Justin_o, you want both occurrances of the word \xe2\x80\x98enhancer\xe2\x80\x99 to be links?
2016-01-25T20:50:34 <Justin_o> anastasiac: that\'s what i was thinking because they are in different table rows, someone might read one but not the other.. what do you think?
2016-01-25T20:51:30 <anastasiac> Justin_o: in the row you reference, there are two occurrances of the word \xe2\x80\x98enhancer\xe2\x80\x99, the first of which is already a link.
2016-01-25T20:53:26 <Justin_o> anastasiac: oh, sorry, missed that... see it now
2016-01-25T20:53:41 <anastasiac> ok, good. I was wondering if I was going crazy...
2016-01-25T20:53:46 <Justin_o> haha
2016-01-25T20:53:49 <Justin_o> no it\'s me :)
2016-01-25T20:53:54 <anastasiac> well, I guess that\xe2\x80\x99s a whole other question
2016-01-25T20:56:30 <Justin_o> anastasiac: i merged https://github.com/fluid-project/videoPlayer/pull/137
