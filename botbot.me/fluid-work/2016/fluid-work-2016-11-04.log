b'2016-11-04T20:39:29 <colinclark> simonjb: This is the branch of Flocking that has modern MIDI support: https://github.com/colinbdclark/flocking/tree/midi-improvements
2016-11-04T20:39:38 <simonjb> thanks colinclark
2016-11-04T20:39:40 <colinclark> In some spots it is, to use your term, a bit ropey
2016-11-04T20:40:22 <colinclark> There are two component you\'ll be interested in
2016-11-04T20:43:40 * yzen is now known as yzen_
2016-11-04T20:43:42 * yzen_ is now known as yzen
2016-11-04T20:44:11 * yzen is now known as yzen_
2016-11-04T20:46:29 * yzen_ has quit
2016-11-04T20:46:48 * yzen joined the channel
2016-11-04T20:47:20 * yzen is now known as yzen_
2016-11-04T20:47:24 * stegru joined the channel
2016-11-04T20:48:33 <colinclark> https://github.com/colinbdclark/Flocking/blob/midi-improvements/src/web/midi.js#L333
2016-11-04T20:48:33 <colinclark> The midi "system" which contains a member variable with all the ports of all the MIDI devices connected to the system
2016-11-04T20:48:33 <colinclark> and it seems to have a method for manually refreshing the ports list
2016-11-04T20:48:33 <colinclark> I am willing to bet that it doesn\'t listen for port events, should there even be such a thing in the underlying node MIDI library
2016-11-04T20:48:33 <colinclark> so that would have to be addressed
2016-11-04T20:48:33 <colinclark> The other one is the midi "connection" component, which represents a connection to a particular set of ports
2016-11-04T20:48:38 <colinclark> typically, this is the one you\'d actually interact with to listen for incoming MIDI events
2016-11-04T20:48:38 <colinclark> https://github.com/colinbdclark/Flocking/blob/midi-improvements/src/web/midi.js#L423
2016-11-04T20:48:38 <colinclark> I seem to have made a kind of monkey-patched thing for Node.js: https://github.com/colinbdclark/Flocking/blob/midi-improvements/src/nodejs/midi.js
2016-11-04T20:48:39 <colinclark> Hard to know if this stuff should just be "inspiration" rather than actually used ;)
2016-11-04T20:48:39 <colinclark> Interestingly, I don\'t see any evidence in the documentation for the Node MIDI module that it even provides events for when ports come and go
2016-11-04T20:48:39 <colinclark> Notably, the WebMIDI API does: https://webaudio.github.io/web-midi-api/#idl-def-MIDIAccess
2016-11-04T20:48:39 <colinclark> In particular: https://webaudio.github.io/web-midi-api/#widl-MIDIAccess-onstatechange
2016-11-04T20:48:39 <colinclark> I don\'t seen anything in a very quick scan of the source code
2016-11-04T20:48:39 <colinclark> but let\'s see what rtmidi supports
2016-11-04T20:48:39 <colinclark> nothing is ever easy :)

2016-11-04T17:21:34 <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: found another blocker. https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6032
2016-11-04T17:21:41 <Justin_o> this time with the Progress demo
2016-11-04T17:29:06 <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: we\'ll have to halt on Progress related testing as well now. So that means for the moment you can test things that aren\'t Uploader, Progress, and Prefs Framework / UIO related.
2016-11-04T17:29:13 <Justin_o> Kobi, David123_: ^

2016-11-04T18:26:07 <cindyli> Justin_o: in terms of this jira: https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6025, which you filed a PR yesterday and I merged it, i just noticed in the same dom element that you removed the text "Press Delete key to remove file" from its aria-lable, this element has a "title" attribute with "Press Delete key to remove file" so this text will still be announced by screen readers. should that "title" text be removed too?
2016-11-04T18:26:50 <Justin_o> cindyli: that title should change after a files is uploaded
2016-11-04T18:28:48 <cindyli> ok, Justin_o, so the file can be removed before the upload but not after?
2016-11-04T18:33:28 <jhernandez> colinclark: just seen your yesterday\'s "hiya"
2016-11-04T18:34:15 <colinclark> jhernandez: hiya
2016-11-04T18:34:17 <jhernandez> est-ce qu\'on parle en quebecois a partir de ce moment-l\xc3\xa0?
2016-11-04T18:34:23 <jhernandez> xDDDD
2016-11-04T18:34:46 <colinclark> :)
2016-11-04T18:35:01 <colinclark> So, if I wanted to demo Cloud4Chrome, what would I have to do?
2016-11-04T18:35:54 <colinclark> jhernandez: ^
2016-11-04T18:36:27 <jhernandez> colinclark: do you mean the ilunion\'s chrome extension?
2016-11-04T18:36:38 <colinclark> or your refactoring of it
2016-11-04T18:36:42 <colinclark> or whatever :)
2016-11-04T18:36:56 <Justin_o> cindyli: yes, that\'s correct
2016-11-04T18:38:29 <jhernandez> colinclark: I think that Ilunion\'s one isn\'t in sync with current master - one sec, will check
2016-11-04T18:38:41 <colinclark> thanks
2016-11-04T18:40:25 <jhernandez> confirmed, ilunion\'s extension is still using socket.io, so it can be demoed right now
2016-11-04T18:40:32 <Justin_o> cindyli: I\'ve also addressed the Progress issue. Could you please also look at https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/779
2016-11-04T18:40:39 <colinclark> jhernandez: Can or cannot?
2016-11-04T18:40:47 <cindyli> sure, Justin_o
2016-11-04T18:40:49 <jhernandez> colinclark: can\'t - sorry
2016-11-04T18:40:54 <colinclark> ok
2016-11-04T18:40:58 <colinclark> and your refactoring of it?
2016-11-04T18:41:00 <colinclark> is it viable?
2016-11-04T18:41:05 <jhernandez> it is
2016-11-04T18:41:12 <colinclark> cool :)
2016-11-04T18:41:33 <colinclark> how would I install it if I wanted to demo it, and what kind of things do you recommend I do to show it at its best?
2016-11-04T18:41:46 <jhernandez> I haven\'t tested it since I applied the last changes, but it should work
2016-11-04T18:41:52 <jhernandez> mm
2016-11-04T18:42:25 <jhernandez> colinclark: do you want to have a quick call for it? I guess that will be better
2016-11-04T18:42:31 <colinclark> sure
2016-11-04T18:42:33 <colinclark> any time
2016-11-04T18:44:38 <jhernandez> colinclark: I still have some time left today - about half an hour
