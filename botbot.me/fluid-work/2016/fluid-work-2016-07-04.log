2016-07-04T17:29:04 <gtirloni> Justin_o, hi. you can join your room, click on the control meeting icon (bottom-left, under contact list), this will open a website. it has a "..." button which lets you access the vidyoreplay library from there
2016-07-04T17:35:16 <Justin_o> gtirloni: ah thanks
2016-07-04T17:35:50 * lliskovoi joined the channel
2016-07-04T17:36:44 <Justin_o> gtirloni: i went to the site and clicked the "..." button
2016-07-04T17:37:06 <Justin_o> in the popup there is something video replay, but the button there doesn\'t seem to work for me
2016-07-04T17:37:50 <gtirloni> it doesn\'t open a website in a window behind?
2016-07-04T17:39:23 <Justin_o> gtirloni: i think my popup blocker was stopping it, I think i have it now. Thanks
2016-07-04T17:39:32 <Justin_o> cindyli: did you record the community meeting last week?
2016-07-04T17:39:43 <PaliwalSparsh> Justin_o , danayo : https://cdn.rawgit.com/PaliwalSparsh/Discovery-Cat/check2/demo/index.html
2016-07-04T17:39:49 <cindyli> yes, Justin_o
2016-07-04T17:40:31 <Justin_o> cindyli: i don\'t see the recording in Vidyo, did you move it?
2016-07-04T17:41:06 <PaliwalSparsh> https://cdn.rawgit.com/PaliwalSparsh/Discovery-Cat/check1/demo/index.html This one starts from the house so you need to not skip, I will implement the skip button.
2016-07-04T17:41:17 <Justin_o> cindyli: or maybe it\'s private to your account?
2016-07-04T17:41:59 <cindyli> possible, Justin_o, i\'m connecting to the video library to check
2016-07-04T17:42:28 <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks
2016-07-04T17:42:44 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: i\'m at the language screen but the keyboard interaction doesn\'t seem to work.
2016-07-04T17:42:45 <cindyli> the page opened by clicking "go to library" takes really long to load. still loading
2016-07-04T17:43:33 <Justin_o> cindyli: mine was stopped by the popup blocker
2016-07-04T17:44:49 <danayo> PaliwalSparsh: music! :)
2016-07-04T17:44:56 <danayo> excited to see the rat house near completion, and able to enter the size room from there
2016-07-04T17:45:19 <danayo> I\'m having the same problem with the keyboard interaction PaliwalSparsh
2016-07-04T17:45:22 <cindyli> Justin_o: that option is not turned on in my firefox settings
2016-07-04T17:45:37 <cindyli> Justin_o: i think i cannot connect to the library
2016-07-04T17:45:41 <cindyli> still loading
2016-07-04T17:45:44 <Justin_o> :(
2016-07-04T17:46:05 <cindyli> now timed out
2016-07-04T17:47:09 <Justin_o> does reloading the page help at all
2016-07-04T17:48:49 <PaliwalSparsh> danayo Justin_o sorry dont know why it is not working will have a look at it. Is the text to speech working.
2016-07-04T17:49:10 * clown has quit
2016-07-04T17:49:10 <danayo> yes, text to speech is working PaliwalSparsh
2016-07-04T17:49:12 <cindyli> Justin_o: seems not, reloading again
2016-07-04T17:49:28 <cindyli> waiting for another time out ;)
2016-07-04T17:50:29 <PaliwalSparsh> Oh thanks danayo thats reliving. Also wanted to tell there is a big issue with sizePref room I will try to fix it, it is with the GO button not working dont know why.
2016-07-04T17:51:22 <gtirloni> cindyli, is that from the office? hear it loads under a sec
2016-07-04T17:51:30 <gtirloni> *here
2016-07-04T17:51:33 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: i was just going to mention that it isn\'t working...
2016-07-04T17:51:39 <danayo> PaliwalSparsh, I couldn\'t get any of the controls on the envelope working (up/down arrows or Go button)
2016-07-04T17:51:40 <cindyli> gtirloni: from my home
2016-07-04T17:52:27 <Justin_o> danayo: i could do it with the mouse but not the keyboard
2016-07-04T17:52:53 <gtirloni> Justin_o, because you\'re an operator, you should be able to see all recordings from all users.
2016-07-04T17:53:01 <danayo> ah, right Justin_o, PaliwalSparsh mouse works, but not keyboard
2016-07-04T17:53:06 <danayo> for up/down
2016-07-04T17:53:08 <gtirloni> Justin_o, the vidyoreplay page should have an admin manager link up top
2016-07-04T17:54:29 <Justin_o> gtirloni: thanks, i think i found the vidyo now
2016-07-04T17:54:52 <cindyli> great
2016-07-04T17:55:06 <Justin_o> cindyli: was the meeting short. It seems to only be about 30 min
2016-07-04T17:55:28 <Justin_o> oh maybe there\'s two recordings
2016-07-04T17:56:03 <cindyli> there are 2 vides for that meeting, Justin_o. there was a privacy concerns with some of the videos that Dragan played, so we stopped recording for that period
2016-07-04T17:56:14 <Justin_o> ah i see
2016-07-04T17:56:29 <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks for doing the recording
2016-07-04T17:56:42 <PaliwalSparsh> Justin_o danayo sorry for the disappointing demo. I will try and fix all these things in a while and send you a link. Please can you tell me other problems you are facing. Like are there frames skipping and movement jerking in some parts. Thanks
2016-07-04T17:58:20 * amatas joined the channel
2016-07-04T17:58:27 <danayo> PaliwalSparsh: I think it\'s looking great
2016-07-04T17:59:48 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: yes, it\'s looking quite good.
2016-07-04T18:00:13 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: the other thing i noticed is that when you leave the room you go back to the start. I think you may want the cat to appear outside of the door to the room he was just in.
2016-07-04T18:01:33 * jhung joined the channel
2016-07-04T18:04:58 <PaliwalSparsh> oh yes will keep that in mind along with the keyboard navigations thankyou very much.
2016-07-04T18:09:55 <danayo> PaliwalSparsh: just a reminder - when you take a look at the keyboard interaction for the language - shift-tab should move focus backwards

2016-07-04T18:34:21 <jhung1> This was the same link used for the advisory board meeting.
2016-07-04T18:35:30 <Justin_o> jhung1: i think that\'s probably it. i don\'t think they merged in my branch yet, but i\'ll double check
2016-07-04T18:36:24 <Justin_o> no it doesn\'t look like they have yet.. i have one more change to make for Jesse, which i\'ll try to do today. Tomorrow we should ask them about merging
2016-07-04T18:36:29 <Justin_o> jhung1: ^
2016-07-04T18:37:00 <jhung1> sounds good Justin_o. For now I\'ll update our PhET wiki pages with this link until we get something more current.

2016-07-04T14:23:38 <jhernandez> :)
2016-07-04T14:23:44 <clown> then you weren't paddling hard enough!
2016-07-04T14:23:50 <jhernandez> hahaha
2016-07-04T14:24:08 <jhernandez> I did
2016-07-04T14:24:40 <clown> I did not work on the windows processes stuff on Thu.  I spent the day testing alfredo's pull request and making comments:  https://github.com/idi-ops/packer-fedora/pull/8#issuecomment-229687992
2016-07-04T14:24:42 <jhernandez> but you know, it was only ~15 kms
2016-07-04T14:24:53 <clown> three days for 15 km?
2016-07-04T14:24:56 <jhernandez> haha
2016-07-04T14:24:57 <clown> :-)
2016-07-04T14:25:06 <jhernandez> no, half the day
2016-07-04T14:25:54 <jhernandez> I went with my brother in law (he's 14) and my wife in a kayak, so it wasn't that hard

2016-07-04T14:27:08 <clown> But, it sounds like you had a good time.
2016-07-04T14:27:31 <jhernandez> clown: haha, I paddled all the time, I was more like a gondolieri
2016-07-04T14:27:43 <clown> did you sing?
2016-07-04T14:27:58 <clown> oh - sole mio ...
2016-07-04T14:28:08 <jhernandez> not a lot, I was trying to not crash with bridges, trees and branches
