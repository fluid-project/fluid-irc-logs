2016-09-16T13:16:59 <Justin_o> Bosmon, colinclark: do you have time to finish reviewing the Infusion PRs this morning. I'm hoping to start with the jQuery upgrade
2016-09-16T13:17:15 <colinclark> I'm not sure, Justin_o
2016-09-16T13:17:43 <colinclark> I will definitely try
2016-09-16T13:18:04 <colinclark> you can still do the jQuery upgrade though, right?
2016-09-16T13:18:14 <Justin_o> colinclark: thanks, that would be helpful. I'm only working this morning so even by monday would be really helpful.
2016-09-16T13:18:55 <colinclark> ok
2016-09-16T13:19:14 <Justin_o> colinclark: i'll try to start in on it, but it may affect the code in the PRs... so it'd be better if they were all in
2016-09-16T13:19:47 <colinclark> you can make a branch with those PRs merged into it, right? and still test the system as if they were there
2016-09-16T13:19:53 <colinclark> if I'm understanding this correctly
2016-09-16T13:20:09 * yzen_ has quit
2016-09-16T13:24:12 <Justin_o> colinclark: yes, that would be possible. Although we'd either have to hold off on merging till those got in, or could potentially require the submitters to update their PRs to work with master.
2016-09-16T13:24:20 <colinclark> yup

2016-09-16T14:16:42 <simonjb> Bosmon and alanharnum: I was going to have a look at the orientation sensor stuff in Android today -- I know you 2 were looking last week and I was wondering if you managed to get anywhere?
2016-09-16T14:16:55 <alanharnum> simonjb: not really past what I reported
2016-09-16T14:17:09 <simonjb> ok, cool, thanks
2016-09-16T14:20:26 <simonjb> alanharnum: and to use the remote debugging, I connect my phone to my computer with USB?
2016-09-16T14:21:17 <simonjb> is this the thing? https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/debug/remote-debugging/remote-debugging?hl=en
2016-09-16T14:22:38 <alanharnum> simonjb: that's the one, yup
2016-09-16T14:23:07 <simonjb> ok, so I'll need USB C to USB A...
2016-09-16T14:23:16 <simonjb> so many connectors
