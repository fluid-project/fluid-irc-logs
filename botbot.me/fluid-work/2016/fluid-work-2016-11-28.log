2016-11-28T13:49:50 <Justin_o> gtirloni: i haven't noticed anything, but haven't done much yet.. where are you seeing the issue.. on the website or through accessing repos
2016-11-28T13:50:02 * kasparne_ joined the channel
2016-11-28T13:51:03 <gtirloni> here it's both.. but `git clone` is the slowest.. https://gist.github.com/gtirloni/d60cc9145baa3a424ce7424ed67cd46f
2016-11-28T13:51:27 <gtirloni> Justin_o: if you have brew, i think you can install a package named 'mtr' and then use it like this: mtr github.com  (to trace the route)
2016-11-28T13:51:43 <gtirloni> i find it useful when things seem slow
2016-11-28T13:52:56 <Justin_o> gtirloni: don't seem to have brew on my machine
2016-11-28T13:53:16 <Justin_o> but i did try to clone infusion into a new directory and it only took a couple of seconds
2016-11-28T13:53:20 <gtirloni> i think macports should have it.. i'm not too familiar with osx
2016-11-28T13:53:40 <Justin_o> yah i don't think i'm using either of those
2016-11-28T13:53:41 <gtirloni> cool, at least it's not something widespread then
2016-11-28T13:53:50 <gtirloni> thanks for checking :)
2016-11-28T13:54:12 <Justin_o> although i have used both mac ports and brew in the past... and thanks for the tip on mtr. i'll try that if i encounter anything slow
