b'2016-11-23T22:03:47 <the-t-in-rtf1> @Bosmon, I just searched around and couldn\'t find anything setting logObjectRenderChars that would have been brought in via gpii-pouchdb.
2016-11-23T22:03:57 <the-t-in-rtf1> (just saw this on my way to bed)
2016-11-23T22:05:09 <the-t-in-rtf1> Just started a broader find to see if I could track it down, will review in the morning.
2016-11-23T22:12:33 <colinclark> LATE the-t-in-rtf1!
2016-11-23T22:12:52 <the-t-in-rtf1> Stayed up trying to get sound support working on the zero.
2016-11-23T22:13:08 <the-t-in-rtf1> succeeded, but not early enough to work on the microphone
2016-11-23T22:13:09 <the-t-in-rtf1> tomorrow
2016-11-23T22:16:52 <the-t-in-rtf1> Anyway, I searched all scripts in every repo I have checked out, there don\'t seem to be any stray uses of logObjectRenderChars
2016-11-23T22:17:15 <the-t-in-rtf1> gpii-pouchdb only has gpii-express as a dependency, neither of those seem to make use of that
2016-11-23T22:18:42 <the-t-in-rtf1> I don\'t see anything in the lines I changed in the forked pouch code either.
2016-11-23T22:26:47 <colinclark> are you going to make a vocoder, the-t-in-rtf1?
2016-11-23T22:26:53 <colinclark> LP VOCODER

2016-11-23T23:27:43 <Bosmon5> Ok, not bad.... 25% less output
2016-11-23T23:27:47 <Bosmon5> Still just as slow though
2016-11-23T23:27:51 <Bosmon5> About 4 minutes to run all the tests
2016-11-23T23:27:58 <Bosmon5> I guess this is the price we pay for having more functionality

2016-11-23T17:01:38 <kasparnet> Bosmon: yes
2016-11-23T17:01:46 <kasparnet> :)
2016-11-23T17:07:17 <kasparnet> Bosmon: there is the arch. meeting now if you\'re available
2016-11-23T17:07:28 <kasparnet> I just totally talked behind your back

2016-11-23T17:29:36 <kasparnet> Bosmon, jhernandez: hmmm.. I\'ve now removed node_modules and first tried re-running "npm install" from inside the vagrant box, and when I still got the error, deleting node_modules and running "vagrant provision"... but still getting the damn error
2016-11-23T17:29:43 <kasparnet> ... any other clues to what the cause might be
2016-11-23T17:31:29 <jhernandez> kasparnet: does the gpii starts by hand? (running node gpii.js as always)
2016-11-23T17:32:24 <Bosmon> kasparnet - well, this will be something to do with the mismatch of the version of node.exe installed on the machine globally, and the one which is embedded inside electron
2016-11-23T17:32:28 <Bosmon> This is one for STEVE GITHENS
2016-11-23T17:32:33 <Bosmon> WHo appears to have ducked out for the present

2016-11-23T17:32:37 <Bosmon> Although stegru may have an idea
2016-11-23T17:33:04 <jhernandez> Bosmon: yes, that was the next thing I was about to say
2016-11-23T17:33:27 <jhernandez> with npm install you build your deps against machine\'s node instead of against electron\'s
2016-11-23T17:34:04 <jhernandez> there\'s a module calles electron-rebuild or something similar that rebuilds your native modules against electron
2016-11-23T17:34:28 <jhernandez> https://github.com/electron/electron-rebuild
2016-11-23T17:34:52 <jhernandez> I remember using it succesfully when playing with electron a year ago or so
2016-11-23T17:35:48 <jhernandez> isn\'t it included in githens branch?
2016-11-23T17:39:31 <stegru> no, i don\'t
2016-11-23T17:40:09 <Bosmon> Well I\'m sure you will soon :)
2016-11-23T17:51:39 <Bosmon> gtirloni, the-t-in-rtf1 - given we\'ve been into JIRA upgrades recently - I wonder if there is any configuration that might allow JIRA to let us edit issues which are closed?
2016-11-23T17:51:48 <Bosmon> It\'s a real annoyance to have to open and close them again just to fix some typo, etc.
2016-11-23T17:53:33 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks for your reviews related to FLUID-5943. I\'ve made the suggested changes to both the Infusion and Infusion-Docs PRs. They are both ready for more review.

2016-11-23T17:56:45 <kasparnet> jhernandez: ok - I\'ll look into that

2016-11-23T18:10:56 <Bosmon> cindyli, the-t-in-rtf1 - I\'m unable to build the windows repo with cindyli\'s GPII-1274 branch in place in the Windows 10 vagrant box on my machine
2016-11-23T18:11:11 <Bosmon> It\'s odd, since I seemed to be able to build it in London yesterday and I didn\'t think there were very substantial changes
2016-11-23T18:11:17 <Bosmon> But I guess there\'s been a change in gpii-pouchdb
2016-11-23T18:11:21 <Bosmon> The failure is here: https://gist.github.com/amb26/a41038648feb759eb10af7660f1ba367
2016-11-23T18:11:35 <Bosmon> Could you try to rebuild, and see if you can reproduce it?
2016-11-23T18:11:39 * michelled joined the channel
2016-11-23T18:11:55 <Bosmon> The package.json syntax that npm complains about is not in the real package.json for leveldown, but might appear in some of the fields that npm synthesizes
2016-11-23T18:12:06 <Bosmon> So my guess is that npm has synthesized something corrupt and then borked on trying to read it
2016-11-23T18:12:18 <Bosmon> It has then deleted the evidence by cleaning up the project as a result of the failure
2016-11-23T18:12:41 <Bosmon> Really, the npm developers are completely sub-standard and I am excited that the-t-in-rtf1 \'s experiments are suggesting that yarn might be a viable replacement

2016-11-23T20:59:26 <cindyli> my office machine can start the window 10 vagrant in the gpii/windows but not my home machine
2016-11-23T20:59:43 <cindyli> the build worked?
2016-11-23T20:59:52 <Bosmon5> As far as I can see, the commit versions of pouchdb-all-dbs is correct
2016-11-23T20:59:57 <Bosmon5> I see a reference to the-t-in-rtf1 \'s repo
2016-11-23T21:00:01 <cindyli> cool
2016-11-23T21:00:06 <Bosmon5> Oh well, perhaps it\'s just that my vagrant machine at home is old

2016-11-23T21:08:07 <Bosmon5> Somehow, even longer than last night
2016-11-23T21:08:46 <Bosmon5> I get lots more errors
2016-11-23T21:09:00 <Bosmon5> Like - (node) warning: possible EventEmitter memory leak detected. 251 created listeners added. Use emitter.setMaxListeners() t
2016-11-23T21:09:00 <Bosmon5> o increase limit.
2016-11-23T21:09:05 <Bosmon5> I didn\'t get this yesterday
2016-11-23T21:10:31 <Bosmon5> They do pass though
2016-11-23T21:12:29 <Bosmon5> I guess we get a lot of output because logObjectRenderChars is 10240
2016-11-23T21:13:45 <cindyli> ooohh no
2016-11-23T21:13:51 <Bosmon5> I imagine that this must be something that the-t-in-rtf1 has done in one of his dependencies
2016-11-23T21:14:09 <Bosmon5> It\'s a shame that this configuration uses a 1960s-style writeable global : P
2016-11-23T21:14:27 <cindyli> lol
2016-11-23T21:14:48 <Bosmon5> It\'s not a VAST amount of output.... but perhaps a 7MB log file from the tests is a little excessive

2016-11-23T14:19:39 <jhung> Justin_o: I haven\'t looked yet. I\'ll take a look later this morning.
2016-11-23T14:19:56 <Justin_o> jhung: okay

2016-11-23T16:03:55 <Bosmon> michelled, kasparnet - do we think the APCP meeting is cancelled today?
2016-11-23T16:04:05 <kasparnet> Bosmon: yes
2016-11-23T16:04:17 <kasparnet> nothing is in the calendar
2016-11-23T16:04:21 <Bosmon> cool - but main arch is still happening?
2016-11-23T16:04:29 <kasparnet> always :)

2016-11-23T16:07:30 <michelled> hey kasparnet
2016-11-23T16:07:43 <kasparnet> hey there
2016-11-23T16:07:55 <kasparnet> I finally got around to start on the task tray
2016-11-23T16:07:58 <kasparnet> gpii-app
2016-11-23T16:08:05 <kasparnet> (or whatever it\'s called)
2016-11-23T16:08:15 <michelled> ah, cool
2016-11-23T16:08:24 <kasparnet> got things running - and looking at the non-working windows tests now
2016-11-23T16:08:31 <michelled> are you working on getting the powershell scripts refactored?
2016-11-23T16:08:47 * gtirloni has quit
2016-11-23T16:09:00 * gtirloni joined the channel
2016-11-23T16:09:29 <kasparnet> haven\'t got too far :) -- which powershell scripts are we talking about?
2016-11-23T16:10:06 <michelled> I just assigned this one to you kasparnet https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2091
2016-11-23T16:10:25 <michelled> "The unit tests are mostly running now in the electron app. It is getting stuck on building the \'test-window\' required for the Process Handling tests. The issue is that the current build scripts assume a particular directory structure that exists when using Vagrant with the Windows VM. In the case of the app-wrapper, the window\'s repo is nested lower down in the file system."
2016-11-23T16:11:00 <michelled> kasparnet: the powershell scripts that Ale recently worked on
2016-11-23T16:11:50 <kasparnet> michelled: ah, yes - I\'m looking at that
2016-11-23T16:11:58 <kasparnet> (just starting to, that is)
2016-11-23T16:12:07 <kasparnet> michelled: got a question though
2016-11-23T16:12:34 <kasparnet> I got things launching, etc., but nothing happens yet when clicking the GPII icon.. That\'s normal, right?
2016-11-23T16:12:34 <michelled> yes?
2016-11-23T16:12:54 <michelled> right clicking on it should give you a menu
2016-11-23T16:13:03 <michelled> from which you can select one of several existing profiles
2016-11-23T16:13:07 <michelled> which should work
2016-11-23T16:13:26 <michelled> once one is keyed in, the menu should be changed so you can key it out or select a different profile
2016-11-23T16:13:38 <michelled> there should also be the option to stop the GPII
2016-11-23T16:14:42 * jhung has quit
2016-11-23T16:14:46 <kasparnet> ok -- didn\'t see that, but might have screwed something up
2016-11-23T16:15:01 <michelled> hmmm\xe2\x80\xa6 which branch are you using?
2016-11-23T16:15:03 * jhung joined the channel
2016-11-23T16:16:18 <kasparnet> michelled: I\'m using your branch
2016-11-23T16:16:21 <kasparnet> but it is working
2016-11-23T16:16:30 <kasparnet> ... I must have been too impatient when first trying it
2016-11-23T16:16:41 <michelled> vagrant up takes a while :)
2016-11-23T16:16:44 <kasparnet> ... clicking it before GPII was fully loaded :)
2016-11-23T16:17:18 <kasparnet> michelled: I\'ll play around with things a bit, and probably get back to you with a gazillion stupid questions
2016-11-23T16:18:17 <michelled> I noticed that I\'m missing line breaks in the very brief readme :)
2016-11-23T16:18:24 <michelled> but I assume you realized that
2016-11-23T16:20:09 <kasparnet> michelled: hehe, I actually didn\'t notice, but if that\'s the level our problems we\'re doing pretty well already
2016-11-23T16:20:35 <michelled> hahaha
2016-11-23T16:21:08 <michelled> so, kasparnet the steps are \'vagrant up\' and wait patiently for it to actually finish :)
2016-11-23T16:21:20 <michelled> then in the VM, open a terminal and \'npm start\'
2016-11-23T16:21:30 * kavya has quit
2016-11-23T16:21:31 <michelled> or if you want to run tests \'npm test\'
2016-11-23T16:21:44 <Bosmon> kasparnet - ***VERY*** patiently :)
2016-11-23T16:21:49 <kasparnet> haha
2016-11-23T16:21:59 <Bosmon> Like, "go off and make dinner and eat it" patiently
2016-11-23T16:22:00 <michelled> oh, I guess you have to actually change directory to c:\\vagrant before running the npm commands
2016-11-23T16:24:13 <kasparnet> michelled: ah - didn\'t realize that last part... I\'ve been mapping the network drive to Z: instead and using that.. good to know
2016-11-23T16:27:23 * colinclark joined the channel
2016-11-23T16:30:27 <Bosmon> michelled - hopefully that bit is in the main README for the windows repository
2016-11-23T16:30:29 <Bosmon> Is it in yours?
2016-11-23T16:30:40 <Bosmon> Justin_o - thanks for the "examples" pull for https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/789
2016-11-23T16:30:52 <Bosmon> Justin_o, michelled - I\'m wondering about the exact details of the lazy loading strategy
2016-11-23T16:30:56 <michelled> Bosmon: no, I will add it
2016-11-23T16:31:13 <Bosmon> It appears that we only load any of the scripts for the prefs editor if we find our cookie stored
2016-11-23T16:31:20 <Bosmon> But this raises the issue of how the cookie ever gets stored
2016-11-23T16:31:49 <Bosmon> If the scripts only ever load if the cookie is found, doesn\'t this mean that any HTML UI written backing the prefs editor will be non-functional?
2016-11-23T16:32:12 * simonjb joined the channel
2016-11-23T16:33:51 <Justin_o> Bosmon: that case detailed there requires the use of the full page prefs editor
2016-11-23T16:34:27 <Justin_o> Bosmon: there is another lazy loading scheme specifically for the separated panel which lazy loads it\'s prefs editor. That is discussed briefly in its docs.
2016-11-23T16:34:29 <Bosmon> Justin_o - ah, ok, I get it
2016-11-23T16:34:44 <Bosmon> Hugely helpful that we have a working sample for this
2016-11-23T16:34:52 <Bosmon> Without which the usage would be even more incomprehensible :)
2016-11-23T16:37:09 <kasparnet> michelled: I\'m getting the error
2016-11-23T16:37:14 <kasparnet> 08:35:57.853:  FATAL ERROR: Uncaught exception: %1 is not a valid Win32 application.

2016-11-23T16:37:26 <Bosmon> Oh kasparnet you WINDOWS NOOB :)
2016-11-23T16:37:40 <kasparnet> stupid windows
2016-11-23T16:37:52 <Bosmon> Yes
2016-11-23T16:38:01 <kasparnet> Bosmon: what the hell am I doing wrong
2016-11-23T16:38:01 <Bosmon> Such errors are caused by having run "npm install" from outside the vagrant box at some time
2016-11-23T16:38:17 <Bosmon> Run rm -rf node_modules from inside the box and then run npm install from inside it again
2016-11-23T16:38:36 <kasparnet> goddamn man
2016-11-23T16:38:37 <kasparnet> :)
2016-11-23T16:38:52 <Bosmon> There is a fix for this on linux, but gtirloni considers windows engineering is too filthy to dirty his hands with :)
2016-11-23T16:39:22 <kasparnet> hahaha
