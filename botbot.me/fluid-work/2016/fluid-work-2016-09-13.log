2016-09-13T19:55:34 <Justin_o> cindyli: could you also review this PR https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/750. avtar has already tested that it resolves the issue.
2016-09-13T19:56:00 <cindyli> ok, Justin_o
2016-09-13T19:56:08 <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks

2016-09-13T20:01:41 <Justin_o> gtirloni: i destroyed my vagrant vm and did vagrant up again when testing your FLUID-5922 PR and it seems to have halted again
2016-09-13T20:02:17 <Justin_o> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/wMZus2Nw/
2016-09-13T20:07:46 <gtirloni> can\'t reproduce here :(
2016-09-13T20:07:54 <gtirloni> that phase is between downloading OS packages and installing them
2016-09-13T20:08:03 <Justin_o> gtirloni: i\'m trying again. I deleted the .vagrant file this time too
2016-09-13T20:12:38 <Justin_o> gtirloni: it seems that deleting the .vagrant file did the trick.
2016-09-13T20:16:01 <gtirloni> cool

2016-09-13T20:25:53 <avtar> colinclark: no, the repo in question had an old webhook url which i just updated
2016-09-13T20:26:06 <avtar> jenkins job builder is complaining about auth issues but that isn\'t the case
2016-09-13T20:26:38 <avtar> how much would it suck if the infusion job lost its job history? https://ci.fluidproject.org/job/fluid-infusion/
2016-09-13T20:27:53 <Justin_o> avtar: considering it didn\'t run tests, probably not as much.. although it\'d be nice to keep if possible.
2016-09-13T20:31:11 <colinclark> avtar: I wouldn\'t cry too much if it was lost\xe2\x80\x94like Justin said
2016-09-13T20:38:40 <avtar> colinclark, gtirloni, Justin_o: the issue turned out to be that there was a \'fluid infusion\' job that was a freestyle job and a multijob was being added with the same name
2016-09-13T20:38:49 <colinclark> aha
2016-09-13T20:38:50 <avtar> the old job had to be deleted to make way for the new one
2016-09-13T20:41:28 * bens__ has quit
2016-09-13T20:44:35 <avtar> i might be able to figure out a way to merge the old build history with this new one

2016-09-13T21:21:39 <Bosmon7> So I did wonder about our acceptance tests on Windows
2016-09-13T21:21:45 <Bosmon7> It seems to me that they must always fail
2016-09-13T21:22:05 <Bosmon7> Since we always run tests based on software that is not in our vagrant box - e.g. JAWS
2016-09-13T21:22:09 <Bosmon7> Could you shed any light on this?
2016-09-13T21:22:10 * danayo joined the channel

2016-09-13T16:39:12 <colinclark> and she\'ll be working with me to chunk out the various features we need in the client and helping with some designs for each of our little development sprints
2016-09-13T16:39:24 <colinclark> she can also review any third-party UI widgets like Polymer that you\'re considering using
2016-09-13T16:40:34 <ewbjr> that sounds great, I\'d love to check out the reports, and definitely looking forward to collaborating :) I sent her a pm and connected with gtirloni yesterday aswell

2016-09-13T18:41:10 <Justin_o> avtar: could you test out my changes for FLUID-5956 ( https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/750 ) and comment on the pull request about your results.
2016-09-13T18:42:59 <avtar> Justin_o: i wouldn\'t replace infusion\'s fedora vagrantfile with the windows one just yet

2016-09-13T18:45:03 <Justin_o> avtar: okay, the PR is fixed now
2016-09-13T18:45:09 <Justin_o> shouldn\'t have the Vagrantfile added anymore
2016-09-13T18:45:20 <avtar> awesome, thanks
2016-09-13T18:55:00 <Justin_o> avtar: also if i\'m testing FLUID-5917 what should the output look like.. that is, how do i know that it is reporting using tap
2016-09-13T18:57:24 <avtar> the report.tap file will be generated after a test run. its content should be identical to what was reported to your terminal. the file is only used by jenkins
