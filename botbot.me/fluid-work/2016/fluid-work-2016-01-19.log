b'2016-01-19T19:29:01 <Bosmon> Or some version from before the dawn of time :)
2016-01-19T19:29:08 <Bosmon> Namely, August 2015....
2016-01-19T19:30:02 <Bosmon> I guess my two errors of reading in your PR compensated for each other.... I guess I had checked that there was no *READ* access to the "tooltips" member but of course you still have the WRITE access where you set these things up
2016-01-19T19:30:22 <Bosmon> Always keep in mind that the one of the main goals of the framework is to assist you to factor things properly .....
2016-01-19T19:35:49 <cindyli1> yes, the new framework plays the magic. the error was gone!! thanks, Bosmon

2016-01-19T14:37:43 <kasparnet> michelled and I are writing up some user stories related to the GPII installer being built in APCP
2016-01-19T14:38:00 <kasparnet> and one of thems deals with sysadmins having to manage the install process
2016-01-19T14:38:33 <kasparnet> could you give us some input on what tools the install procedure needs to be compatbile with
2016-01-19T14:38:39 <kasparnet> so our user story right now is:
2016-01-19T14:38:41 <kasparnet> "As a sys admin I want the automated installation process to be scriptable and compatible via my regular sysops tools, such as: "
2016-01-19T14:38:49 <kasparnet> would would go next?

2016-01-19T14:41:07 <gtirloni> that\'s a good question because there a multitude of ways to deploy apps in a windows network. i believe the most common/simple without buying any fancy enterprise product is through a MSI installer and GPOs (Group Policies)
2016-01-19T14:41:35 <gtirloni> in an Active Directory environment

2016-01-19T15:42:40 <simonjb> cindyli: the comment "What does this component do? What criteria does it meet?"
2016-01-19T15:42:48 <cindyli> yes, simonjb
2016-01-19T15:42:58 <simonjb> yes cindyli for sure

2016-01-19T15:54:36 <cindyli> hi Bosmon
2016-01-19T15:54:45 <Bosmon> Hi cindyli
2016-01-19T15:54:51 <cindyli> Bosmon: according to this comment - https://github.com/amb26/universal/pull/2/files#r49771258
2016-01-19T15:55:14 <Bosmon> cindyli - yes
2016-01-19T15:55:16 <cindyli> i\'m thinking how i can create this grade component that only tracks tooltip components within test cases
2016-01-19T15:55:26 <Bosmon> cindyli - how could you not create it? : P
2016-01-19T15:56:13 <Bosmon> cindyli - in fact, it already exists
2016-01-19T15:56:14 <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/tests/component-tests/tooltip/js/TooltipTests.js#L50
2016-01-19T15:56:27 <cindyli> in the main component "privacySettings", i need to create and have those tooltips, but if the tracking only occurs in the tests, how can i get hold of those tooltips
2016-01-19T15:56:38 <cindyli> ok. checking
2016-01-19T15:58:10 <Bosmon> cindyli - the comment particularly refers to that member that you have defined
2016-01-19T15:58:21 <cindyli> ah ha. smart. will try it
2016-01-19T15:58:29 <Bosmon> cindyli - no code within your implementation uses the "tooltips" member on the component
2016-01-19T15:58:33 <Bosmon> Not that I can discover, anyway
2016-01-19T15:58:38 <cindyli> that\'s certainly true
2016-01-19T15:59:05 <cindyli> thanks, Bosmon

2016-01-19T16:52:47 <Justin_o> cindyli: do you have a minute for quick check in
2016-01-19T16:52:55 <cindyli> sure, Justin_o
2016-01-19T16:52:56 <jhernandez> clown: wrt https://github.com/javihernandez/linux/pull/20
2016-01-19T16:54:37 <jhernandez> I forgot to mention that I performed a security update on my distro, and after restarting the system, the problem was gone
2016-01-19T16:54:49 <clown> aha!
2016-01-19T16:54:54 <jhernandez> so yeah, I don\'t think it\'s worth keeping it opened
2016-01-19T16:55:00 <clown> you had a bad "sudo". :-)
2016-01-19T16:55:06 <jhernandez> hah
2016-01-19T16:55:08 <jhernandez> not sure
2016-01-19T16:55:59 <clown> okay, so, shall I close the pull request as "no longer needed"?
2016-01-19T16:56:07 <jhernandez> sure
2016-01-19T16:56:32 <jhernandez> you can save the branch though
2016-01-19T16:56:46 <jhernandez> it\'s free
2016-01-19T16:56:47 <jhernandez> :)
2016-01-19T16:57:18 <clown> closed.  Branch will stay on github at least.  I may delete it locally, although it probably doesn\'t take up too much space.

2016-01-19T17:14:47 <bens_> hi alanharnum: thought i\'d let you know that other than the comment i left on https://github.com/GPII/first-discovery-server/pull/5 the first discovery docker build is working nicely on bluemix
2016-01-19T17:15:04 * cindyli has quit
2016-01-19T17:15:32 <alanharnum> bens_: cool, good to know - i think the issue with the version is that during the outstanding PR, we switched from building our container images using Jenkins instead of relying on Docker Hub
2016-01-19T17:15:59 <alanharnum> we\'ve got a tag for building 4.2.1 but it\'s not being built automatically atm by Jenkins

2016-01-19T19:25:36 <cindyli1> hi Bosmon
2016-01-19T19:25:47 <Bosmon> Hi cindyli1
2016-01-19T19:26:20 <cindyli1> the refactoring of the tooltip tests. i\'ve switched the code to instantiate tooltips in the previous way - https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/GPII-1245/gpii/node_modules/gpii-oauth2/gpii-oauth2-authz-server/public/src/components/privacySettings/js/PrivacySettings.js#L258
2016-01-19T19:26:39 <Bosmon> cindyli1 - why was it necessary to change the way the tooltips were instantiated?
2016-01-19T19:27:19 <cindyli1> Bosmon: i mean instead of tracking tooltips in the privacySettings member options, they are no longer tracked there
2016-01-19T19:27:36 <cindyli1> the trackTooltips component in the test - https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/GPII-1245/gpii/node_modules/gpii-oauth2/gpii-oauth2-authz-server/webTests/components/privacySettings/js/PrivacySettingsTests.js#L81
2016-01-19T19:28:05 <cindyli1> however, using
2016-01-19T19:28:05 <Bosmon> cindyli1 - ok, I understand
2016-01-19T19:28:06 <cindyli1> target: "{/ fluid.tooltip}.options.listeners"
2016-01-19T19:28:12 <cindyli1> causes this error:
2016-01-19T19:28:23 <cindyli1> ASSERTION FAILED: Error in selector string - cannot match child selector expression starting at / fluid.tooltip
2016-01-19T19:28:42 <Bosmon> cindyli1?
2016-01-19T19:28:44 <cindyli1> ya
2016-01-19T19:28:46 <Bosmon> Are you using the current framework?
2016-01-19T19:28:53 <cindyli1> ah, right right
2016-01-19T19:29:01 <cindyli1> oh, thanks. what a waste of time
