2016-04-10T19:43:45 <simonjb> colinclark: I\'m going to head home soon (I\'m in the office)
2016-04-10T19:44:06 <colinclark> you\'re at the office!
2016-04-10T19:44:10 <colinclark> how did it go?
2016-04-10T19:44:15 <simonjb> I added some notes to the "Nexus demo for P4A Review April 2016" doc
2016-04-10T19:44:27 <colinclark> awesome
2016-04-10T19:44:37 <colinclark> I\'ll take a look and resume my piano hacking shortly
2016-04-10T19:44:51 <simonjb> good, I didn\'t do any new work -- tidying and making notes
2016-04-10T19:44:52 <colinclark> I think I have everything I need for the trip now
2016-04-10T19:44:54 <colinclark> great
2016-04-10T19:44:57 <colinclark> thanks so much
2016-04-10T19:45:56 <colinclark> Is your web component square a good place to look into how to integrate a non-Infusion component?
2016-04-10T19:46:02 <colinclark> with the Nexus
2016-04-10T19:46:34 <simonjb> yes, I think so -- though right now the URL is hardcoded in the component source
2016-04-10T19:46:57 <simonjb> it\'s not parameterised
2016-04-10T19:47:11 <simonjb> but it is an example of making a simple webcomponent
2016-04-10T19:48:29 <simonjb> colinclark: anything I can help with before I head offline?
2016-04-10T19:48:53 <colinclark> nope, go for it
2016-04-10T19:48:55 <colinclark> i\'m good
2016-04-10T19:49:07 <simonjb> do you have my mobile number?
2016-04-10T19:49:24 <simonjb> you can text me if I can help with anything
2016-04-10T19:49:54 <colinclark> I do yes
2016-04-10T19:49:59 <colinclark> but I think I\'ll be fine
2016-04-10T19:50:02 <colinclark> this stuff is fun
2016-04-10T19:50:10 <simonjb> yeah, it\'s pretty cool
2016-04-10T19:50:39 <simonjb> ok, see you tomorrow -- and do text me if I can help
2016-04-10T19:50:43 <colinclark> thanks again, simonjb

2016-04-10T19:55:21 <simonjb> oh colinclark, Till filed an issue against nexus-examples! https://github.com/simonbates/nexus-examples/issues/2
2016-04-10T19:56:57 <colinclark> curious
2016-04-10T19:57:38 <colinclark> not quite sure what it means
2016-04-10T19:57:42 <colinclark> but that\'s nice
