b'2016-08-31T20:34:38 <avtar> i\'ve been using it here to test this new box and haven\'t encountered any weirdness (yet)

2016-08-31T20:50:22 <bens___> oh.. and i figured it out.. i got the error in powershell, not cmd.exe
2016-08-31T20:51:11 <bens___> i have that network issue when i\'m on my IBM VPN that i have to do some powershell command on a newly created vagrant box to set my network to private so winrm works
2016-08-31T20:53:23 <avtar> ah that\'s right
2016-08-31T20:53:32 <avtar> i forgot about your network issue

2016-08-31T23:46:40 <gloob> anyway, call it a day, I\'m destroyed now
2016-08-31T23:47:59 <bens___> hi gloob there is some issue with doit that we were troubleshooting
2016-08-31T23:48:16 <bens___> think we making progress, but i\'m about to call it a day too i think
2016-08-31T23:48:34 <gloob> ok, I will test it tomorrow my morning
2016-08-31T23:49:13 <bens___> ok - check in if you run into a wall. there is an issue inthe c:\\windows\\do.bat file. it seems that we need to run the refreshenv command in the same call to doitclient.exe as our "real" command we want to run
2016-08-31T23:49:58 <bens___> ex: doitclient.exe wcmd refreshenv & "%*"
2016-08-31T23:50:55 <gloob> got it
2016-08-31T23:54:47 <gloob> thanks and good night
2016-08-31T23:55:05 <avtar> hey gloob
2016-08-31T23:55:09 <avtar> sorry, got too many windows open here

b'2016-08-31T17:01:08 <avtar> the-t-in-rtf: just did that :)
2016-08-31T17:06:20 <the-t-in-rtf> I had to blow away my node_modules directory before my commit hooks would fire properly, I just pushed that change as well.
2016-08-31T17:06:36 <the-t-in-rtf> I also removed the step to install bower, which I killed off everywhere a while back.
2016-08-31T17:06:57 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, you can fetch the changes, but they shouldn\'t make any difference, as it was the LTS install that failed for me.
2016-08-31T17:07:34 <the-t-in-rtf> OK, I will keep an eye on the chat here and there, but am ready to get dinner and see my family.
2016-08-31T17:07:59 <the-t-in-rtf> Let me know what you find, we need to get the builds working again before we can reasonably merge those PRs.
2016-08-31T17:08:34 <avtar> the-t-in-rtf: yup i\'m able to reproduce the issue here
2016-08-31T17:08:56 <avtar> i\'ll ping you once i have a fix
2016-08-31T17:11:27 <the-t-in-rtf> great, as long as you can see the behavior, that\'ll work.
2016-08-31T17:11:37 <the-t-in-rtf> It\'s why overlap time is so important.
2016-08-31T17:11:47 <the-t-in-rtf> You tag me, I work on something while you\'re asleep, and vice versa.
2016-08-31T17:11:47 <the-t-in-rtf> :)
2016-08-31T17:11:51 <the-t-in-rtf> Have a great day!
2016-08-31T17:16:57 <gloob> the-t-in-rtf and avtar are you talking aboout this? https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/466/files#diff-3254677a7917c6c01f55212f86c57fbfR1
2016-08-31T17:17:30 <gloob> well, or this https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/466/files#diff-d6d618aa6069c63a6811c544dffdc9d2R12
2016-08-31T17:17:43 <gloob> AFAIK we are not using docker container for universal for development

2016-08-31T17:56:47 <avtar> bens___: could you please message your email address to me?
2016-08-31T17:56:56 <bens___> avtar, is the new one newer than the recently updated inclusivedesign/windows10-eval?
2016-08-31T17:57:56 <avtar> bens___: yes, it contains some changes that gtirloni has been working on https://github.com/gtirloni/idi-packer-windows/blob/master/README.md#internals-doit

2016-08-31T18:01:41 <gloob> umhhh, dolt
2016-08-31T18:01:54 <gloob> and originally winrm was implemented with what?
2016-08-31T18:02:23 <gloob> oh oh, ok
2016-08-31T18:03:34 <gloob> gtirloni: is there doit osx client?
2016-08-31T18:03:41 <gloob> before start to compile it :)
2016-08-31T18:05:00 <gloob> work/upstream/doit  master \xe2\x9c\x94                                                                                                                                                                                                        176d  \xe2\x8d\x89
2016-08-31T18:05:04 <gloob> \xe2\x96\xb6 ./doitclient --help
2016-08-31T18:05:08 <gloob> it works in osx so far
2016-08-31T18:09:25 <cindyli> avtar: I\'ve modified enough gpii configs that require more changes in this file - https://github.com/avtar/ansible-flow-manager/blob/03c7994cf966b86073aeebd602f399159d45d717/tasks/deploy.yml
2016-08-31T18:09:34 <cindyli> in order to start the vm
2016-08-31T18:09:37 <gloob> avtar: gtirloni how I know if doit is working?
2016-08-31T18:09:53 <gloob> in the windows part
2016-08-31T18:09:57 <gloob> the server
2016-08-31T18:10:43 <avtar> gloob: there\'s no doit server for os x though
2016-08-31T18:10:52 <gloob> I have the client compiled so far
2016-08-31T18:10:58 <gloob> work/upstream/doit  master \xe2\x9c\x94                                                                                                                                                                                                        176d  \xe2\x8d\x89
2016-08-31T18:11:02 <cindyli> avtar: i know you have a pull request for that change, would you like continue to make more changes or i create an own branch for it?
2016-08-31T18:11:02 <gloob> \xe2\x96\xb6 ./doitclient wclip -r
2016-08-31T18:11:05 <gloob> /private/tmp/com.apple.launchd.SupE7GvyZa/org.macosforge.xquartz: Undefined error: 0
2016-08-31T18:11:25 <avtar> we were using winrm to launch the client in the vm which talks to the server (also running in the vm)
2016-08-31T18:12:20 <avtar> cindyli: it\'ll probably take less time for me to make those changes since i already have a pr open
2016-08-31T18:12:36 <gloob> ok, moving to linux then
2016-08-31T18:12:47 <gloob> brb in half of an hour or so
2016-08-31T18:12:56 <cindyli> cool, avtar, let me know when you have time to talk about new changes
2016-08-31T18:13:03 <avtar> ok
2016-08-31T18:14:48 <bens___> avtar, is the purpose of DoIt to execute commands on the console/gui of the windows vagrant box as if it were the user his self executing the commands?
2016-08-31T18:15:14 <avtar> bens___: yes
2016-08-31T18:16:02 <avtar> to provide a similar experience like we have for linux over ssh and pointing to the local display server with DISPLAY=:0
2016-08-31T18:18:26 <avtar> we have been setting up windows VMs as temporary build nodes to work around this issue https://github.com/GPII/ci-service/blob/master/jenkins_jobs/windows.yml#L60 so this should help us move away from the jenkins node approach
2016-08-31T18:19:44 <avtar> in the long-term a client and server similar to doit will be required though since we\'ll experience the same issue when os x needs to be supported as a platform

2016-08-31T20:05:14 <gloob> avtar: what is the correct box location_
2016-08-31T20:05:34 <gloob> where correct is with the doit changes
2016-08-31T20:06:17 <avtar> gloob: there isn\'t one just yet. a couple of changes were required after tests so a new one is being built. i\'ll upload it within the hour and email you and bens___
2016-08-31T20:06:29 <gloob> inclusivedesign/windows10-eval
2016-08-31T20:06:31 <avtar> or anyone else if they\'re interested in trying it out
2016-08-31T20:06:45 <avtar> gloob: you probably have 0.3.0 of that box
2016-08-31T20:06:46 <gloob> oh, so I can build then
2016-08-31T20:06:56 <avtar> the new one will be 0.4.*
2016-08-31T20:07:02 <avtar> gloob: if you want :)
2016-08-31T20:07:07 <gloob> of course

2016-08-31T20:07:32 * alanharn_ joined the channel
2016-08-31T20:08:20 <avtar> you\'ll need to install this plugin: vagrant plugin install vagrant-winrm
2016-08-31T20:09:03 <avtar> and after you\'ve brought the gpii/windows vm up with this new box you can use the following command (without rebooting windows):
2016-08-31T20:09:04 <avtar> vagrant winrm -c "do.bat \'node tests\\UnitTests.js\'"
2016-08-31T20:09:15 <avtar> vagrant winrm -c "do.bat \'node tests\\AcceptanceTests.js\'"
2016-08-31T20:09:23 <gloob> wo wo wo wo
2016-08-31T20:09:42 <gloob> no more cortana for me, thanks
2016-08-31T20:09:55 <gloob> I needed to remember in the beginning the command type
2016-08-31T20:10:29 <avtar> you mean to build a new box?
2016-08-31T20:10:41 <gloob> no, to do a cat of a file in windows shell
2016-08-31T20:11:04 <gloob> or like they said, command prompt
2016-08-31T20:11:15 <avtar> gloob: type <filename>
2016-08-31T20:11:19 <gloob> correct
2016-08-31T20:11:37 <gloob> I remember it from my DOS memories
2016-08-31T20:12:18 * alanharnum has quit
2016-08-31T20:12:24 <avtar> i remember it because i had to learn a few basic windows command when i started working on automating stuff for gpii windows

2016-08-31T20:12:35 <gloob> same here
2016-08-31T20:12:38 <avtar> almost ready to take my mcse exam
2016-08-31T20:12:43 <gloob> but with additional background
2016-08-31T20:12:54 <gloob> dont do that
2016-08-31T20:13:16 <gloob> it is like to comment in a powershell issue in github
2016-08-31T20:13:18 <gloob> do not
2016-08-31T20:13:24 <avtar> haha
2016-08-31T20:13:35 <avtar> gtirloni comments on powershell gh issues
2016-08-31T20:13:40 <gloob> no
2016-08-31T20:13:49 <avtar> maybe he already has his mcse though
2016-08-31T20:13:53 <gloob> he is?
2016-08-31T20:14:07 <gloob> brave
2016-08-31T20:14:30 <gtirloni> i even open my own powershell gh issues
2016-08-31T20:14:30 <avtar> gloob: i\'m not 100% sure
2016-08-31T20:14:34 <avtar> i think i\'ve already said too much
2016-08-31T20:14:35 <gloob> hehehehe
2016-08-31T20:14:56 <gloob> gtirloni is our powershell user of reference
2016-08-31T20:14:57 <gloob> then
2016-08-31T20:15:12 <gloob> I cannot say power user in this case by reiteration
2016-08-31T20:15:15 <gloob> to avoid it

2016-08-31T20:32:01 <avtar> bens___: what happened?
2016-08-31T20:32:03 <bens___> avtar, i\'ll try and replicate that if I can.. i wonder if it migh thave been a case of me just needing to delete my node_modules so things get rebuilt
2016-08-31T20:33:40 <bens___> the node process complained about something.. i lost my console log of it though so i\'ll try and reproduce it :(

2016-08-31T12:43:57 <Bosmon7> Sheesh... github\'s notification mails don\'t half make it hard to figure out what has actually happened sometimes
2016-08-31T12:44:56 <Bosmon7> I got a mail with title "Merge pull request #6 from fluid-project/master"
2016-08-31T12:45:27 <Bosmon7> It seems to have alanharnum as author
2016-08-31T12:45:34 <Bosmon7> But I can\'t tell what has been merged, or where
2016-08-31T12:45:47 <alanharnum> i think that\'s from me merging the upstream master in my fork of Infusion
2016-08-31T12:46:44 <alanharnum> which i did before making the branch to make that small linter config PR yesterday
2016-08-31T12:46:49 <alanharnum> which Justin_o just merged
2016-08-31T12:46:56 <Bosmon7> Wow, bizarre
2016-08-31T12:47:59 <alanharnum> this is the related PR: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/741/commits
2016-08-31T12:48:31 <alanharnum> it\'s possible I\'m doing something unhelpful when I merge that upstream master from fluid-project to my fork to keep my own master up to date
2016-08-31T12:48:35 <alanharnum> which i do periodically
2016-08-31T12:48:50 <alanharnum> you can see the commit messages at https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/741/commits
2016-08-31T12:48:56 <Justin_o> alanharnum: when you merge in upstream what command do you use?
2016-08-31T12:49:15 <alanharnum> i suspect this is gonna make me sound like worst-ever version control user
2016-08-31T12:49:20 <alanharnum> but i just do it through the GitHub web panel
2016-08-31T12:50:23 <Justin_o> oh okay.. not sure how they do that internally, but i wonder if they use "--no-ff" we tend to not use that when  updating our master from upstream, so that they stay the same
2016-08-31T12:50:31 <alanharnum> that\'s probably correct
2016-08-31T12:51:09 <alanharnum> i do it via a PR against my branch from fluid-project
2016-08-31T12:51:46 <alanharnum> https://help.github.com/articles/merging-a-pull-request/ - yup, their web interface use "--no-ff"
2016-08-31T12:52:44 <Justin_o> interesting use of PRs to update through the web interface
2016-08-31T12:52:59 <alanharnum> interesting or "interesting" :)
2016-08-31T12:53:26 <Justin_o> well it\'s kind of strange that you can do pretty much everything through the web site now other than keep your forks up-to-date automatically
2016-08-31T12:54:03 <alanharnum> i find it faster than going via the command line, and it also gives me an overview when i\'m doing it of what\'s changed in master
2016-08-31T12:55:01 <alanharnum> but it does appear to create annoying and useless messages in my commits
2016-08-31T12:55:18 <Justin_o> alanharnum: yes, that\'s unfortunate
2016-08-31T12:56:12 <Justin_o> alanharnum: you might be able to use source tree or github desktop to achieve something similar without the --no-ff flag
2016-08-31T12:56:24 <alanharnum> it looks like it\'s possible to use this option via web: https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-request-merges/

2016-08-31T13:21:29 <Justin_o> alanharnum: i guess you should be careful about that one when merging in master too, because it will make all the changes from master look like they are coming from a single commit
2016-08-31T13:21:59 <Justin_o> i\'m guess that does a git rebase or a git reset under the hoods, both of which history and commit hashes

2016-08-31T13:49:56 <Justin_o> jhung: i need a version so the header image ( NOAA ) logo from this demo http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/prefsFramework/ for the lgdg theme
2016-08-31T13:50:08 <Justin_o> thanks
2016-08-31T13:51:14 <jhung> just for lgdg? What about the other modes Justin_o?
2016-08-31T13:51:24 <Justin_o> jhung: they are already there

2016-08-31T15:44:31 <the-t-in-rtf> @avtar, I\'m finally looking at builds again if you\'re around.
2016-08-31T15:44:41 <the-t-in-rtf> None of the pushes I\'ve made today seem to have triggered anything.
2016-08-31T15:47:50 <avtar> the-t-in-rtf: what time are you logging off today?
2016-08-31T15:48:08 <the-t-in-rtf> I am in the architecture meeting for the next hour
2016-08-31T15:48:14 <the-t-in-rtf> or for however long it lasts.
2016-08-31T15:48:20 <the-t-in-rtf> it starts in twelve minutes.
2016-08-31T15:53:18 <Bosmon7> the-t-in-rtf - what\'s wrong with the travis builds on the latest Firefox?
2016-08-31T15:54:10 <the-t-in-rtf> same thing as on the desktop.
2016-08-31T15:54:27 <the-t-in-rtf> 48 is too new for Webdriver 2.0
2016-08-31T15:54:29 <avtar> the-t-in-rtf: ok, gonna switch tasks and hopefully figure this out before you leave
2016-08-31T15:54:33 <the-t-in-rtf> and WebDriver 3 isn\'t out yet.
2016-08-31T15:54:43 <the-t-in-rtf> I could upgrade to the beta, but I\'d rather wait if it\'s forthcoming.
2016-08-31T15:55:12 <the-t-in-rtf> Travis has the option to pin their version to 47, which should still work.
2016-08-31T15:55:26 <the-t-in-rtf> I would use chromedriver there, but I have not found anyone who\'s managed to get that working at all on Travis.
2016-08-31T15:55:36 <the-t-in-rtf> Most people couple their Travis builds with sauce labs, it seems.

2016-08-31T16:11:33 <Justin_o> jhung: could you please take a look at this PR https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/743
2016-08-31T16:11:34 <the-t-in-rtf> Pinning the version to 46.0 gets us back to at least some of the firefox tests passing, so that appears to be an OK approach for now.
2016-08-31T16:12:02 <the-t-in-rtf> @avtar, what version of FF is installed on linux-desktop?
2016-08-31T16:12:09 <jhung> sure Justin_o. I probably won\'t get around to it until tomorrow.
2016-08-31T16:12:47 <Justin_o> jhung: okay
2016-08-31T16:25:17 <avtar> the-t-in-rtf: 47.0
2016-08-31T16:26:19 <the-t-in-rtf> awesome.
2016-08-31T16:26:20 <avtar> whenever a new box is built it updates chrome and firefox to the version available in fedora\'s repository
2016-08-31T16:26:50 <the-t-in-rtf> long term we should be fine keeping pace, in the short term it\'s helpful that it\'s 47
2016-08-31T16:40:23 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, @avtar, I can\'t get the new "lts" setting you suggested working even with my local Vagrant (check your mail).
2016-08-31T16:40:34 <the-t-in-rtf> As they say on radio call-in programs, I\'m happy to take my answer off the air.
2016-08-31T16:44:05 <avtar> the-t-in-rtf: i\'m trying that out here
2016-08-31T16:44:12 <avtar> please stay on the line
2016-08-31T16:44:30 <the-t-in-rtf> I make no promises once the meeting ends, my dinner is sitting on the stove.
2016-08-31T16:44:41 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, I will be near the computer throughout the evening.
2016-08-31T16:44:58 <the-t-in-rtf> Seriously, I can easily hang out till the hour.
2016-08-31T16:46:16 <the-t-in-rtf> If you\'re trying to reproduce, you\'ll need to manually update the Vagrantfile to use fedora24.
2016-08-31T16:46:19 <the-t-in-rtf> I haven\'t pushed that yet.
