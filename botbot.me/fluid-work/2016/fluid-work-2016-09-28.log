b'2016-09-28T17:17:38 <Bosmon> cindyli - my guess is that the problem is with browserify, based on no evidence
2016-09-28T17:17:44 <Bosmon> Try removing it and see if the install works
2016-09-28T17:17:49 <cindyli> ok
2016-09-28T17:19:30 <Bosmon> cindyli - so the failure occurs only in the VM and not on your desktop?
2016-09-28T17:19:35 <cindyli> yes, Bosmon
2016-09-28T17:19:38 <Bosmon> ok
2016-09-28T17:19:53 <Bosmon> Well, at least we are well positioned to feed back repro steps to the npm team :)
2016-09-28T17:20:06 <Bosmon> Given we have worked so hard on our public CI infrastructure
2016-09-28T17:20:06 <gtirloni> cindyli: add the npm version you want to the provisioning/common-vars.yml file (https://github.com/idi-ops/ansible-nodejs/blob/master/defaults/main.yml#L15). it\'s using npm 3 because that\'s what comes with node 6
2016-09-28T17:20:39 <Bosmon> Of course Cindy\'s stuff will in the end need to build with npm 3 since we will have to use it on Windows
2016-09-28T17:20:44 <Bosmon> So my earlier suggestion was a bit silly
2016-09-28T17:21:01 <cindyli> Bosmon: ur new suggestion is to use npm 3
2016-09-28T17:21:03 <cindyli> i guess
2016-09-28T17:21:59 <cindyli> gtirloni: so seems we need to continue to figure out a work-around with npm 3. but before that, I\'m trying without browserify dependencies
2016-09-28T17:22:18 <gtirloni> cindyli: just to help my brain remember the issue... i should clone your GPII-1821 branch, go to production-components-vm and `vagrant up`.. then i\'ll see the error? or is that on the root dir?
2016-09-28T17:22:36 <gtirloni> ah, so it\'s browserify the root cause?
2016-09-28T17:22:42 <cindyli> no, gtirloni
2016-09-28T17:22:44 <Bosmon> gtirloni - no this is jsut an exploratory guess
2016-09-28T17:23:18 <cindyli> gtirloni: pull my GPII-1274 branch, go to universal root directory and run "vagrant up"
2016-09-28T17:23:30 <gtirloni> ok thanks
2016-09-28T17:23:39 <cindyli> GPII-1821 is an old story
2016-09-28T17:23:46 <cindyli> no problem. thanks, gtirloni
2016-09-28T17:28:23 <gtirloni> cindyli: it worked here on a clean repo clone
2016-09-28T17:28:43 <cindyli> ah ha
2016-09-28T17:28:45 <gtirloni> node 6.7.0 and npm 3.10.3
2016-09-28T17:31:12 <gtirloni> yeah, all tests passed too
2016-09-28T17:31:44 <gtirloni> maybe it was the node_modules mix up after all
2016-09-28T17:32:44 <cindyli> gtirloni: did you do "rm -rf node_modules" and "vagrant destroy" before running "vagrant up"?
2016-09-28T17:33:18 <gtirloni> cindyli: i didn\'t need to because it was a clean clone of your repo so i didn\'t have anything in it
2016-09-28T17:33:30 <cindyli> ok
2016-09-28T17:33:50 <gtirloni> but my host is also fedora 24 here so i think it wouldn\'t be able to reproduce your problem (osx host creating binaries in node_modules)
2016-09-28T17:36:17 <simonjb> gtirloni, cindyli: I\'m wondering if there is some mechanism that we might be able to use to isolate a vm node_modules from the host\'s
2016-09-28T17:36:43 <simonjb> we have had a number of issues where shared node_modules has caused problems
2016-09-28T17:37:28 <simonjb> I definitely get that we want to share the actual source code, so that we can make changes and test
2016-09-28T17:37:56 <simonjb> but I\'m wondering (and I don\'t know of a way right now) if we might be able to use separate node_modules
2016-09-28T17:38:11 <gtirloni> maybe we can play with NODE_PATH
2016-09-28T17:39:11 <ewbjr> gtirloni: could you enable Github Pages on the repo when you get a moment :)
2016-09-28T17:40:29 <gtirloni> ewbjr: done, it\'s tracking the master branch
2016-09-28T17:41:15 <simonjb> gtirloni: https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_loading_from_node_modules_folders suggests that NODE_PATH is only used if a module isn\'t found in node_modules
2016-09-28T17:44:37 <simonjb> I doubt it, but is there anything we could do in the virtualbox shared folder mounting? Like mount this directory here except for this subdirectory
2016-09-28T17:49:55 <cindyli> gtirloni, Bosmon, it\'s the new dependency on gpii-pouchdb causing the stack size issue
2016-09-28T17:50:08 <cindyli> not browserify
2016-09-28T17:50:40 <cindyli> i think that makes sense with the cross dependency description in the npm issue
2016-09-28T17:50:53 <cindyli> gpii-pouchdb is dependent on kettle, infusion
2016-09-28T17:51:20 <cindyli> kettle is dependent on gpii-pouchdb and infusion too.
2016-09-28T17:51:53 <simonjb> we have circular dependency?
2016-09-28T17:52:16 <simonjb> kettle -> gpii-pouchdb -> kettle ?
2016-09-28T17:52:24 <simonjb> cindyli: ^
2016-09-28T17:53:07 <cindyli> simonjb: but they are in "devDependencies" section tho
2016-09-28T17:53:17 <cindyli> https://github.com/the-t-in-rtf/gpii-pouchdb/blob/GPII-1897/package.json#L29
2016-09-28T17:53:22 <simonjb> ah, interesting
2016-09-28T17:53:24 <cindyli> https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/blob/master/package.json#L31
2016-09-28T17:54:35 <simonjb> devDependencies shouldn\'t cause a circular dependency issue, right?
2016-09-28T17:55:47 <simonjb> they shouldn\'t be installed transitively
2016-09-28T18:00:44 <cindyli> that\'s true
2016-09-28T18:00:48 <amatas> simonjb, regarding the vbox share folder mounting, it uses a network share to mount the directory. It isn\'t possible to exclude files or directories.
2016-09-28T18:01:44 <amatas> Perhaps installing all the modules "as global" and using the NODE_PATH that gtirloni mentioned we could have a separate node_modules in the vm
2016-09-28T18:01:59 <Bosmon> cindyli - oh yes
2016-09-28T18:02:10 <Bosmon> There\'s that issue that kettle itself fails to install on npm 3
2016-09-28T18:02:22 <cindyli> right
2016-09-28T18:02:29 <cindyli> gtirloni: seems i can consistently reproduce the issue when gpii-pouchdb is presented. do you have time to vidyo call so we can share screens
2016-09-28T18:02:30 <Bosmon> Ok, well this is at least soluble
2016-09-28T18:02:40 <Bosmon> Although I think it involves factoring kettle into 2 modules
2016-09-28T18:02:48 <gtirloni> we could bind mount the node_modules inside the VM to be somewhere else
2016-09-28T18:04:08 <cindyli> gtirloni: call? or later?
2016-09-28T18:06:19 <gtirloni> cindyli: sure, feel free to call me when you\'re ready
2016-09-28T18:06:36 <cindyli> cool. thanks
2016-09-28T18:08:05 <Justin_o> jhung: sorry about the late reply, but essentially yes. I think they can either wait for the Infusion 2.0 release, which we will have to create a new plugin release for as well.. but they could upgrade now to what\'s there and upgrade again after. I think the second upgrade shouldn\'t be much work
2016-09-28T18:08:33 <simonjb> gtirloni: could we bind mount node_modules if a directory of that name already exists?

2016-09-28T18:27:26 <gtirloni> Bosmon cindyli simonjb: i must retract my assertion that it worked here because it just failed twice while cindy was watching. now i\'m not sure what i was testing exactly (i remember cloning the repo, switching to the branch and doing a vagrant up... I probably messed up which branch I used)
2016-09-28T18:27:30 * michelled joined the channel
2016-09-28T18:27:43 <gtirloni> good news is that i now i can reproduce the issue reliably I guess
2016-09-28T18:29:19 <gtirloni> simonjb: yes https://www.pastery.net/cjqwyd/
2016-09-28T18:29:38 <gtirloni> it shadows the contents in it
2016-09-28T18:30:51 <gtirloni> it just occurred to me that between my successful attempt and now the failures, the only difference might actually have been that Cindy was watching this time. uh oh..
2016-09-28T18:31:10 <gtirloni> ;)
2016-09-28T18:31:15 <Justin_o> avtar, gtirloni: i\'m noticing that the infusion build has been failing. Although I didn\'t get any e-mails reporting it
2016-09-28T18:31:19 <Justin_o> at least i didn\'t notice any
2016-09-28T18:31:28 <Justin_o> it seems that it failed because of a TAP error
2016-09-28T18:32:33 <michelled> fluid-everyone: we were going to spend a half hour now talking about pair and mob programming
2016-09-28T18:33:48 <gtirloni> Justin_o: i\'ll check that

2016-09-28T18:41:10 <Justin_o> gtirloni: so abortions aren\'t considered failures?

2016-09-28T18:43:01 <gtirloni> Justin_o: yeah, the email "publisher" only considers jobs marked as "FAILURE". it seems to ignore all other statuses (aborted usually means someone took action or there were a low-level failure)
2016-09-28T18:43:18 <gtirloni> i agree it should report aborted jobs all the same
2016-09-28T18:43:48 <gtirloni> but there\'s no option for that. maybe the admins should have received an email about the breakage

2016-09-28T18:56:39 <simonjb> thanks very much gtirloni for the mount example -- this could be a solution for a Linux guest vm, do you know of any way to do something similar in a Windows vm?
2016-09-28T18:56:47 <cindyli> gtirloni, Bosmon, simonjb: the jira for npm3 issue with VM: https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2059
2016-09-28T18:56:59 <cindyli> feel free to add or update
2016-09-28T18:58:05 <gtirloni> simonjb: i think it\'s called a "directory junction" on windows
2016-09-28T18:59:31 <gtirloni> Justin_o: looks like the tests are getting stuck and jenkins is aborting the build -- https://ci.fluidproject.org/job/infusion-tests/9/console (whatver comes after test 50)
2016-09-28T18:59:38 <gtirloni> cindyli: thanks!
2016-09-28T18:59:49 <cindyli> thanks, gtirloni
2016-09-28T19:00:56 <simonjb> gtirloni: I don\'t know if it\'s something that we have resources to look at right now, but I\'ll file a JIRA issue that captures what we\'ve talked about so far regarding mechanisms to make node_modules in vms separate from the host
2016-09-28T19:02:25 <Justin_o> gtirloni: thanks.. i wonder what test that would be
2016-09-28T19:02:28 <gtirloni> simonjb: it\'s probably something we could consider as a change in the ansible-nodejs role. thanks for filing the JIRA.

2016-09-28T20:17:16 <Bosmon> cindyli - no, not yet
2016-09-28T20:17:30 <Bosmon> But the idea will be to convert the 1 kettle github repo to represent 5 separate npm modules
2016-09-28T20:17:38 <Bosmon> And hence break the cyclic dependency between modules
2016-09-28T20:17:51 <Bosmon> Between kettle and gpiipouchdb
2016-09-28T20:18:18 <Bosmon> Well
2016-09-28T20:18:25 <Bosmon> Now I come to think about it, this might not be enough to break the cycle
2016-09-28T20:18:36 <Bosmon> Since we would create kettle-dataSource whose tests depend on gpii-pouchdb
2016-09-28T20:18:44 <Bosmon> But I imagine that gpii-pouchdb will depend on kettle-dataSource too
2016-09-28T20:19:44 <Justin_o> gtirloni: ran the tests through testem on the fedora vm and they all passed for me
2016-09-28T20:21:04 <Justin_o> i might have to kill the vm and try again though

2016-09-28T13:19:40 <jhung> Justin_o: did you see the email from Carla re UIO integration on RTF?
2016-09-28T13:20:07 <Justin_o> jhung: i did yes.. wanted to chat with michelled about it a bit
2016-09-28T13:20:39 <Justin_o> if they have time, it's probably better to upgrade them to the wp plugin, but we'll probably want to upgrade the plugin to use Infusion 2.0 after it's release
2016-09-28T13:21:03 <michelled> yes, both those things make sense
2016-09-28T13:21:11 <Justin_o> i didn't look closely at the disconfiguration issue mentioned, did you see it?
2016-09-28T13:21:17 <Justin_o> jhung, michelled ^
2016-09-28T13:21:22 <Justin_o> michelled: okay cool
2016-09-28T13:21:24 <michelled> I think it was the vertical layout
2016-09-28T13:21:32 <michelled> and also, some of the options don't work
2016-09-28T13:21:35 <michelled> like toc
2016-09-28T13:21:38 <Justin_o> ah
2016-09-28T13:21:40 <Justin_o> okay
2016-09-28T13:21:46 <michelled> Justin_o, jhung: it doesn't sound like they have developers working on this :(
2016-09-28T13:21:56 <Justin_o> there might need to be some changes on their site too, but perhaps they are just running into some bugs from the old version
2016-09-28T13:22:05 <michelled> I want to check in with colin to see if we can put effort into this, or just give guidance
2016-09-28T13:22:28 <Justin_o> michelled: good idea to check on that
2016-09-28T13:22:37 <Justin_o> please let us know which route to take
2016-09-28T13:22:44 <michelled> Justin_o: do you know if we have anything more up to date than this in terms of telling people how to make their site UIO compatible? https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/docs/Working+With+A+Preferences+Editor+On+Your+Site
2016-09-28T13:23:32 <michelled> Justin_o: I'm thinking for right now we should send some links - one to the existing updated UIO, one to the wp plugin and any useful docs
2016-09-28T13:24:03 <michelled> Justin_o: are there UIO improvements in 2.0?
2016-09-28T13:24:46 <Justin_o> michelled: bug fixes, but i'm not sure when the wp plugin was last updated
2016-09-28T13:24:53 <Justin_o> so not sure how many changes since thne
2016-09-28T13:24:54 <Justin_o> then
2016-09-28T13:26:08 <michelled> TJ is using the latest WP plugin on his site: http://tjbliss.org/
2016-09-28T13:26:37 <Justin_o> michelled: also don't see any more recent documentation
2016-09-28T13:27:47 <michelled> oh dear. those dots are an h1.

2016-09-28T13:33:14 <Justin_o> michelled: it looks like the plugin hasn't been updated in a while. https://github.com/fluid-project/uio-wordpress-plugin
2016-09-28T13:33:35 <Justin_o> here are resolved issues for UIO and the Prefs Framework since then

2016-09-28T13:43:08 <michelled> Justin_o: do you think I'm correct in saying that moving from that version to the new version after 2.0 will not be a lot of work? I'm thinking that the majority of work is in doing the initial upgrade to modern UIO and getting the site fixed up to play nicely
2016-09-28T13:44:50 <Justin_o> michelled: i think that's the work needed to be done... whether it is a lot of work or not, i'm not sure. It sounds like they'll need to integrate our plugin, i don't know how difficult that is, jhung might know. The site fix up really depends on how their site is created...
2016-09-28T13:48:38 * PaliwalSparsh joined the channel
2016-09-28T13:51:10 <jhung> Justin_o: the hard part is getting their containers and styling to work well with UIO. Once they have the plugin installed, they'll need to go through each adjuster and fix styles that prevent it from functioning.
2016-09-28T13:53:39 * Jess_ joined the channel
2016-09-28T13:54:12 <Justin_o> jhung: i'm hoping that because they have a version of UIO already, it won't be as much work, but i'm not sure the nature of all their issues

2016-09-28T17:03:03 <gtirloni> cindyli1: just to double check, which version of VirtualBox do you have installed? `VBoxManage --version`
2016-09-28T17:03:27 <cindyli1> gtirloni: 5.0.16r105871
2016-09-28T17:04:07 * colinclark has quit
2016-09-28T17:04:12 <gtirloni> please try updating to 5.0.26 -- http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/5.0.26/VirtualBox-5.0.26-108824-OSX.dmg
2016-09-28T17:05:03 <gtirloni> the shared folder where the node_modules dir is could be causing some issues (after a quick glance at some of the github issues linked in the meeting notes)
2016-09-28T17:05:48 <Bosmon> Hi there cindyli1 - so I again have a pass on all-tests on universal
2016-09-28T17:06:00 <Bosmon> This is with node 6.6.0 32-bit on Windows
2016-09-28T17:10:15 * styki has quit
2016-09-28T17:11:04 <cindyli1> Bosmon: i got all tests passing too with the node 6.7.0 and npm 3.10.3. sorry about the false alarm. it might because I was playing with both the vm and local in the morning and they have shared node_modules/ or listening on the same port
2016-09-28T17:11:11 * cindyli1 is now known as cindyli
2016-09-28T17:11:23 <Bosmon> ok cool
2016-09-28T17:11:49 <cindyli> so now the issue left is to fix the stack size error with the VM.
2016-09-28T17:11:55 <Bosmon> stack size!
2016-09-28T17:12:13 <cindyli> https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/10776
2016-09-28T17:12:43 <Bosmon> Absurd
2016-09-28T17:13:17 <Bosmon> npm 3 really is a pile of junk
2016-09-28T17:13:21 <jhung> Justin_o: so in response to Carla's email, are we suggesting that they wait for the Infusion 2.0 release? Of if they can't, at least upgrade to current. Then we can give them some pointers if they need help after upgrading?
2016-09-28T17:13:35 <Bosmon> Feel free to continue with npm 2 yourself, I have a feeling we will be trying to support it for a while
2016-09-28T17:13:49 <Bosmon> npm 3 just meets the specific use case of being able to make an installer bundle on Windows
2016-09-28T17:14:07 <Bosmon> So we only need it to work to that extent

2016-09-28T17:15:13 <cindyli> Bosmon: the problem is my pull request won't pass the CI 'cuz npm 3 is used there
2016-09-28T17:15:24 <Bosmon> cindyli - that's awkward
2016-09-28T17:15:31 <Bosmon> Does your pull request change the project dependencies?
2016-09-28T17:15:43 <cindyli> yes. added more dependencies
2016-09-28T17:15:47 <Bosmon> Which ones
2016-09-28T17:16:27 <cindyli> Bosmon: https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/464/files#diff-155
2016-09-28T17:17:30 <cindyli> mainly gpii-pouchdb and a few others for browserifying node dependencies for kettle url data source
