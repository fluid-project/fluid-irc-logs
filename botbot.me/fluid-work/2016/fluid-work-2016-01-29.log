2016-01-29T14:44:25 <Justin_o> brendan_d: there\'s a problem here https://github.com/bjderzin/first-discovery/blob/tooltips/src/js/panels.js#L1252
2016-01-29T14:44:46 <Justin_o> you have a reference to an id but you\'ve set this as a class in the template https://github.com/bjderzin/first-discovery/blob/tooltips/src/html/saveTemplate.html#L4
2016-01-29T14:45:08 <Justin_o> brendan_d: what you probably want is testButton: ".gpiic-fd-save-testButton"
2016-01-29T14:46:43 <brendan_d> Justin_o: making that changes causes the button to dissapear off the page.
2016-01-29T14:47:04 <Justin_o> ah right okay.. you need to add another options
2016-01-29T14:47:39 <Justin_o> selectorsToIgnore: ["testButton"]
2016-01-29T14:48:54 <Justin_o> It was being removed because the renderer wasn\'t given any instructions in the protoTree for that selector.. the selectorsToIgnore option tells the renderer to ignore those selectors when rendering
2016-01-29T14:49:11 <brendan_d> Justin_o: wow its finally working
2016-01-29T14:49:17 <Justin_o> :)
2016-01-29T14:49:19 <Justin_o> excellent
2016-01-29T14:50:05 <brendan_d> Justin_o: ive been banging my head against a wall about this for hours
2016-01-29T14:51:33 <Justin_o> brendan_d: sorry to hear that, but i know the feeling

2016-01-29T15:30:56 <alanharnum> things are mostly quiet at reference desks these days, which is the basic predicament of reference librarians as a specialized group within the library world

2016-01-29T17:19:31 <Bosmon> Hi there Justin_o - I\'ve issued an update to my FLUID-5821 branch at https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/657
2016-01-29T17:19:42 <Bosmon> As I suspected, this is a race condition that has always been there in these tests
2016-01-29T17:20:00 <Bosmon> The issue is that the very first test fixture consists of a refreshView which races against the AJAX fetch of the component\'s template
2016-01-29T17:20:26 <Bosmon> "normally" we win this race, but on some slower setups it is more likely that we lose
2016-01-29T17:20:58 <Bosmon> avtar had mentioned recently that he was able to receive this test failure on trunk in his new QI continuous build server VM
2016-01-29T17:21:30 <Bosmon> What is awkward is that, through some incredible oversight from the original developer, there was no way to actually check whether the resources had arrived.....
2016-01-29T17:21:48 <Bosmon> So I have added a new event "onResourcesFetched" to fluid.rendererComponent which now fires once the resources have arrived
2016-01-29T17:22:25 <Bosmon> And I have adjusted the SelfVoicingPanel tests to wait for this event using our slightly peculiar but now well-established pattern for registering listeners to components before they are constructed....
2016-01-29T17:22:39 <Bosmon> Could you retest and see if it now looks good to you?
2016-01-29T17:22:47 <Bosmon> Perhaps avtar could take a look too
2016-01-29T17:23:39 <Bosmon> Also I want to ping cindyli to read the above since she is a kind of "renderer and prefs panels supremo" so should be aware of this new event.... I\'ll add it to our docs once the pull gets in
2016-01-29T17:24:01 <avtar> Bosmon: that\'s awesome :)
2016-01-29T17:24:19 <avtar> i\'ll confirm today
2016-01-29T17:24:37 <Bosmon> avtar - cheers
2016-01-29T17:24:57 <Bosmon> The other issue that you get, the "incorrect test count near enactors tests" is something that I receive on my machine quite a lot too :(
2016-01-29T17:25:05 <Bosmon> But I\'m not sure there\'ll be cycles to fix it for a while
2016-01-29T17:25:21 <Bosmon> I only see it on Chrome and only sometimes
2016-01-29T17:25:40 <Bosmon> And it appears to be some deep and dark issue related to the way QUnit and the QUnit composite plugin schedule tests between frames

2016-01-29T13:54:44 <brendan_d> Morning everyone. I have some questions about the tooltip feature, if anyone could help id appriciate it. Currently tryint to understand how to implment them on a button on a panel which does not already implement tooltips.

2016-01-29T14:19:08 <brendan_d> justin_o: yes, i used gpii.firstDiscovery.attachToolip.renderer
2016-01-29T14:19:40 <brendan_d> Justin_o: and included the tooltipContentmap and the selectors
2016-01-29T14:20:18 <brendan_d> Justin_o: i think the issue might be with connecting it to the template
2016-01-29T14:21:31 <Justin_o> brendan_d: do you have some code we could look at and are you getting any errors?
2016-01-29T14:23:03 * anastasiac joined the channel
2016-01-29T14:25:38 <brendan_d> Justin_o: it doesn not return any errors. Basicaly what i did was create a new 'test button' in the panel and am trying to connect a tooltip to it. Im using the 'save' panel which is a new panel that we created in the last demo. i can send code, im just not sure what the best way to do that would be
2016-01-29T14:28:58 <Justin_o> brendan_d: do you have something up in github? or a running demo that we could access remotely?
2016-01-29T14:29:11 <Justin_o> if neither of those you could use something like http://pastebin.com to pass your code along
