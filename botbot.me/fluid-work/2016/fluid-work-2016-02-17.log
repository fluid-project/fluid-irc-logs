b'2016-02-17T19:12:34 <avtar> currently we just opt to run the tests in a vm and ignore the host environment
2016-02-17T19:12:43 <Justin_o> avtar: okay
2016-02-17T19:13:06 <Justin_o> avtar: will we also have more than one vm at some point?
2016-02-17T19:13:29 <avtar> that\'s a good question
2016-02-17T19:15:06 <avtar> it\'s possible but so far every project has had a repository dedicated to each platform
2016-02-17T19:15:34 <avtar> for server-side tasks we default to centos
2016-02-17T19:17:02 <avtar> i wonder what the use cases would be for attempting to support multiple virtual platforms while working with one repository
2016-02-17T19:17:38 <Justin_o> avtar: i was thinking of that more in terms of browser side i guess.. where we might want to run the tests in linux, windows, mac etc.. that would be more likely for say infusion
2016-02-17T19:17:41 <avtar> perhaps browser tests if we don\'t use a service like saucelabs in the future
2016-02-17T19:17:45 <avtar> yes :P
2016-02-17T19:17:50 <Justin_o> :)
2016-02-17T19:18:13 <Justin_o> so we have a few possible options right now.. 1) vm (linux) 2) local 3) sauce labs
2016-02-17T19:18:29 <Justin_o> although 3 is also in the futre
2016-02-17T19:18:31 <Justin_o> future
2016-02-17T19:21:22 <avtar> yes, and if #3 isn\'t viable for some reason (let\'s say if saucelabs stops providing free access to open source projects) then it would be more like 1) local, 2) vm, 2.1) linux, 2.2) windows, 2.3) os x
2016-02-17T19:24:11 <avtar> sorry, one sec
2016-02-17T19:27:53 <avtar> Justin_o: back
2016-02-17T19:28:46 <Justin_o> avtar: yep.. i guess we might want to have a way to say where to run the tests... grunt tests --destination="linux" or something like that
2016-02-17T19:29:00 <Justin_o> and grunt tests might default to something, maybe the local machine
2016-02-17T19:29:03 <Justin_o> what do you think
2016-02-17T19:29:16 <avtar> that seems reasonable
2016-02-17T19:29:49 <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: today\'s community meeting is going to be a continuation of the discussion about the IDRC site

2016-02-17T21:08:04 <jhung> Justin_o: I found this regarding aria role "status" https://www.paciellogroup.com/blog/2014/03/screen-reader-support-aria-live-regions/
2016-02-17T21:08:13 <jhung> "From the screen reader point of view, adding the status role forces Window Eyes to recognise the polite ARIA live region in Firefox. However it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make any difference to VoiceOver in Safari (iOS), or Window Eyes or NVDA in Internet Explorer."
2016-02-17T21:08:31 <jhung> I wonder if that is still accurate. The article was published in 2014.
2016-02-17T21:10:37 <Justin_o> hard to know, there have been a lot of updates since then... but i wouldn\'t be surprised if it is the same
2016-02-17T21:12:27 <jhung> I\'ve added role=status to my gh-pages branch. Try it out Justin_o - I don\'t see any difference in voice over.

2016-02-17T17:01:40 <Bosmon> Hi Justin_o - I couldn\'t reproduce the issue
2016-02-17T17:01:58 <Bosmon> I wonder if, given the issue seems to be reproducible for just with keyboard, whether you could test for it on current trunk?
2016-02-17T17:02:07 <Bosmon> for -> for you

2016-02-17T17:50:59 <colinclark> hey avtar
2016-02-17T17:51:12 <avtar> colinclark: hi
2016-02-17T17:58:14 <colinclark> so I was thinking
2016-02-17T17:58:18 <colinclark> sorry to be slow to respond
2016-02-17T17:58:35 <colinclark> I think I\'d really love for there to be a convention about how to run tests in a VM
2016-02-17T17:58:59 <colinclark> so that, whatever project you\'re working on, you know you just type "foo bar" and then all the tests run
2016-02-17T17:59:05 <colinclark> or "foo bar baz" to run only the baz-type tests
2016-02-17T17:59:11 <colinclark> sorry for the dorky abstract terms
2016-02-17T17:59:21 <colinclark> since I\'m not sure precisely what our convention should be
2016-02-17T17:59:41 <colinclark> but something that it totally consistent everywhere
2016-02-17T17:59:49 <colinclark> yet won\'t cause confusion about how to run the tests on the host instead
2016-02-17T17:59:53 <colinclark> am i making any sense?
2016-02-17T18:02:20 <avtar> colinclark: yes, just trying to think of what that convention would look like
2016-02-17T18:16:10 <avtar> colinclark: did this come up after seeing the changes in the universal pr?
2016-02-17T18:16:23 <colinclark> yeah
2016-02-17T18:16:36 <avtar> ok
2016-02-17T18:16:37 <colinclark> just because of what felt like a potential asymmetry across projects
2016-02-17T18:16:51 <colinclark> and I thought we might as well come up with a relatively universal convention
2016-02-17T18:17:09 <colinclark> Justin_o is pretty good with these kinds of naming conventions if you want to solicit his advice
2016-02-17T18:20:36 <avtar> yes, input from more sources that would be affected by this type of change would be helpful
2016-02-17T18:20:46 <avtar> on a somewhat related note i left a comment on that pr https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/444#discussion-diff-53205301

2016-02-17T19:00:34 <Justin_o> avtar: how fine grained can you get with running tests... can you run a single file for example?
2016-02-17T19:01:08 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i\'ll try to reproduce the issue i mentioned, on the FLUID-5821 pull, in master
2016-02-17T19:04:35 <avtar> Justin_o: i guess that depends on how a project\'s tests are set up to be run
2016-02-17T19:04:38 <avtar> https://github.com/avtar/universal/blob/GPII-1572/Gruntfile.js#L41-L49
2016-02-17T19:04:41 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes, i was able to reproduce it from the build site
2016-02-17T19:05:28 <Justin_o> avtar: perhaps you could take it in as a flag
2016-02-17T19:06:01 <Justin_o> like grunt run tests --tests="path to test"
2016-02-17T19:06:07 <Justin_o> or something like that
2016-02-17T19:06:22 <Justin_o> but i guess to the specific point.. i agree with colinclark about the consistency
2016-02-17T19:07:15 <Justin_o> so grunt tests to run all tests seems like a good option and i guess this is what you have already
2016-02-17T19:07:34 <avtar> Justin_o: yes
2016-02-17T19:07:50 <Justin_o> except that production tests don\'t seem to be included.. i\'m not sure what those are though and how they differ
2016-02-17T19:09:16 <avtar> what\'s confusing at the moment is that \'grunt tests\' is used to run tests in a vm but someone might expect that task to run tests "locally" on their host instead
2016-02-17T19:10:51 <avtar> so there are potentially two environments and numerous testing options in each environment
2016-02-17T19:11:21 <Justin_o> avtar: ah i see
2016-02-17T19:12:09 <Justin_o> avtar: how do you distinguish between those two environments right now?
