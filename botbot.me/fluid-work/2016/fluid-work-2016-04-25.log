2016-04-25T13:33:59 <simonjb> hey dins :)
2016-04-25T13:34:18 <dins> Thanks a lot for all the help I had from U all
2016-04-25T13:34:28 <dins> to improve my proposal
2016-04-25T13:34:37 <dins> it was accepted finally
2016-04-25T13:34:38 <dins> :)
2016-04-25T13:34:58 <simonjb> congratulations!
2016-04-25T13:35:18 <dins> I uploaded the tax form to GSOC profile today
2016-04-25T13:35:42 <dins> and there was a small problem in my payoneer account
2016-04-25T13:35:51 <dins> and working on to get it fixed now
2016-04-25T13:36:18 <dins> which mean, I had already created a payonner account long time ago, and now it has been blocked
2016-04-25T13:36:26 <dins> :)
2016-04-25T13:37:26 <simonjb> hope you get it all sorted out soon
2016-04-25T13:39:11 <simonjb> hi colinclark, were you going to send me a pull request against nexus-examples?

2016-04-25T13:40:13 <colinclark> Just tidy-up changes, but still
2016-04-25T13:40:17 <colinclark> let me take a quick look right now

2016-04-25T20:03:35 <alanharnum> Bosmon / Bosmon7 / cindyli: colinclark said one of you might know if there's a known issue with the onscreen keyboard / GPII under Windows 10
2016-04-25T20:03:53 <alanharnum> i looked through the issues but didn't see something mentioned
2016-04-25T20:05:06 <cindyli> alanharnum: sorry, i don't know if there's a such issue
2016-04-25T20:05:11 <colinclark> alanharnum is seeing an error message when the keyboard launches
2016-04-25T20:05:23 <gtirloni> steve got that error , i guess
