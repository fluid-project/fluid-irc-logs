2016-05-05T17:30:34 <PaliwalSparsh> @colinclark We need to have alternative for gitter if we choose it, I think we will have to come back to IRC in that case.

2016-05-05T17:34:12 <PaliwalSparsh> @colinclark I always thought opensource communities ignore vendor-based alternative because of some ethics they have, for the first time I came to know about the reason why it happens so.

2016-05-05T17:53:13 <colinclark> Again, I\'m not at all against Gitter
2016-05-05T17:53:20 <colinclark> just like to weight the pros and cons

2016-05-05T18:00:49 <alanharnum> avoiding or mitigating lock-in is a big consideration when selecting a system
2016-05-05T18:01:25 <alanharnum> as an ops person (some days) "what would we do if the vendor stopped supporting this / this open-source project went away" is always something that\'s in the back of my mind
2016-05-05T18:02:01 * yzen_ joined the channel
2016-05-05T18:03:12 <gtirloni> a counter argument is that, if the vendor allows you to extract the data, then you can migrate it somewhere else (the only example i know/remember if mattermost accepting exports from slack). so it\'s not a decision for life, hopefully
2016-05-05T18:03:57 <alanharnum> yup
2016-05-05T18:04:15 <alanharnum> exportable / extractable data is a big one

2016-05-05T18:15:15 <simonjb> hey Bosmon, I\'m working through the new kettle README.md and had something to ask
2016-05-05T18:16:04 <simonjb> the table on WebSockets request component members doesn\'t include onBindWs
2016-05-05T18:16:30 <simonjb> I was wondering if that was intentional (it\'s internal) or if it should be there
2016-05-05T18:17:43 <simonjb> I\'m using onBindWs in the Nexus and I\'m wondering if I should be using handleRequest instead? (depending on the answer to the previous question) https://github.com/simonbates/nexus/blob/master/src/Nexus.js#L140
2016-05-05T18:18:34 <simonjb> I\'ll also add a note to the pull request suggesting that we add an example WebSockets client
2016-05-05T18:18:49 <simonjb> but wanted to discuss with you first

2016-05-05T13:47:47 <gtirloni_> i remember we had the same discussion when Slack was proposed. the major complaints were around it being a proprietary service and the accessibility support was suboptimal. PaliwalSparsh1, you may want to investigate this about gitter. just wanted to give some perspective/background context on this topic.
2016-05-05T13:48:43 <gtirloni_> we also had a Mattermost instance up for a while, just remembered.

2016-05-05T13:59:47 <PaliwalSparsh1> @gtirloni I also considered slack but didnot suggest it because of its bad reputation among opensource companies. But gitter is used by many opensource communities, thanks for letting me know about it I will add in my draft how gitter overcomes all the failures of slack..
2016-05-05T13:59:51 <wale> it\'s one of the nicer collaborative tools out there .. agree that accessibility features are a bit lacking. For now at least

2016-05-05T16:20:05 <colinclark> cindyli: One of the key reasons why use IRC as our main chat medium is because of accessibility
2016-05-05T16:20:12 <colinclark> there are so many different kinds of IRC clients
2016-05-05T16:20:35 <colinclark> and there are ones that work for a variety of different styles and preferences
2016-05-05T16:20:49 <colinclark> A lot of people are hot on Slack these days, and it\'s a really nice environment
2016-05-05T16:21:05 <colinclark> but of course Slack hasn\'t made their clients accessible
2016-05-05T16:21:11 <colinclark> I haven\'t tried Gitter
2016-05-05T16:21:28 <colinclark> but my impression is that anything we look at shouldn\'t be a replacement for IRC, so much as a complement to it
2016-05-05T16:21:39 <colinclark> Slack, for example, has a means to bridge between IRC and a slack room
2016-05-05T16:22:41 <cindyli> good point, colinclark, let me see if i can add this discussion as a comment to the wiki
2016-05-05T16:24:14 <colinclark> I guess the other risk of something like Gitter is that it\'s a single-vendor solution
2016-05-05T16:24:37 <colinclark> So one should always be a bit skeptical about claims like "Free, Forever"

2016-05-05T17:25:37 <PaliwalSparsh> @colinclark Really thank you for the feedback :) I feel if there are multiple messaging alternatives(IRC and gitter) available, community will eventually choose one over the other in some time. Also if we all believe in something like github for being free forever for our open projects, we can put a bet on gitter too.
2016-05-05T17:25:41 <PaliwalSparsh> Accessibility with IRC is certainly an important aspect, and for that gitter has a IRC bridge, I have referenced it in the draft.
2016-05-05T17:26:18 <colinclark> PaliwalSparsh: Have you looked at the accessibility of the Gitter client?
2016-05-05T17:26:35 <colinclark> And in regards to the comment about Github, that\'s a great point
2016-05-05T17:26:55 <colinclark> one of the key reasons we\'re able to trust and use Github so extensively is that it\'s fully backed by Git, which is open source and portable
2016-05-05T17:27:08 * michelled joined the channel
2016-05-05T17:27:09 <colinclark> so we know there are other forums and tools that would be available to us if, as a community, we ever had to migrate
2016-05-05T17:27:17 <colinclark> so the point isn\'t being resistent to vendor-backed solutions
2016-05-05T17:27:46 <colinclark> but being sure that there is sufficient manoverability for our community in cases where a vendor might change directions in the future
