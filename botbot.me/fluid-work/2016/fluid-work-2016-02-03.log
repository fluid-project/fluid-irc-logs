b'2016-02-03T18:51:24 <Bosmon> It seems your iframe is already doing this....
2016-02-03T18:51:40 <Bosmon> We just need to fire up the right jQuery

2016-02-03T18:54:38 <Justin_o> Bosmon: but i guess it is necessary anways
2016-02-03T18:55:49 * yzen is now known as yzen_
2016-02-03T18:57:41 <Bosmon> Justin_o - can you remind me again why we are trying to show tooltips in iframes? : P

2016-02-03T19:02:38 <Justin_o> Bosmon: it\'s for the GPII / UIO integration
2016-02-03T19:02:39 <Justin_o> https://www.dropbox.com/s/i4c3pni6cnnwuts/uioptions%20GPII%20integration.pdf?dl=0
2016-02-03T19:02:49 <Justin_o> so the new panel needs tooltips for its buttons
2016-02-03T19:03:00 <Bosmon> oh yes
2016-02-03T19:03:01 <Bosmon> I see
2016-02-03T19:05:14 <Justin_o> danayo: if you want to talk about the PGA test plans i have some time now before the community meeting, or we could also talk after
2016-02-03T19:05:33 <Bosmon> Justin_o, cindyli - so I imagine what I will do is hoist some of this code from the prefs framework out into the core framework:
2016-02-03T19:05:34 <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/preferences/js/SeparatedPanelPrefsEditor.js#L214
2016-02-03T19:05:56 <Bosmon> Otherwise we\'ll just have to duplicate it everywhere we deal with iframes, including in Justin_o\'s recent test cases
2016-02-03T19:06:53 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks, what will that look like
2016-02-03T19:07:12 <Bosmon> Justin_o - hopefully it will just look like having your current test case "happen to work" automatically : P
2016-02-03T19:07:36 <Bosmon> I hadn\'t realised that it is possible to make a jQuery search that "bridges the worlds" directly, even as badly as we currently do
2016-02-03T19:07:38 <Justin_o> danayo: actually, i don\'t have time before the community meeting, but after, if you want to talk
2016-02-03T19:07:54 <Justin_o> Bosmon:  :)
2016-02-03T19:07:57 <Bosmon> So it is "a little unusual" that the container of your tooltips component is the "document" for the iframe, but it seems that it might be possible to make this work
2016-02-03T19:08:06 <Bosmon> I already patched up the other failures that this causes
2016-02-03T19:08:33 <Bosmon> For example the places in the tooltip component where it tries to check that the container "is contained" by the document, which it isn\'t if it actually IS the component
2016-02-03T19:09:04 <Bosmon> So it seems that we should be able to fix up the DOM binder to automatically detect whether the user appears to be trying to use this pattern, and just automatically fish out the correct jQuery by using the method that we have in the prefs framework
2016-02-03T19:09:19 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i guess it doesn\'t have to be the document itself, but that seemed like a good place to start :)
2016-02-03T19:09:28 <Justin_o> the iframe element didn\'t work as the container
2016-02-03T19:09:48 <Justin_o> that sounds good
2016-02-03T19:10:05 <Bosmon> Justin_o - oh, I see now
2016-02-03T19:10:15 <Bosmon> This is why you have this funky expander
2016-02-03T19:10:16 * michelled joined the channel
2016-02-03T19:10:33 <danayo> sounds good Justin_o
2016-02-03T19:10:35 <Bosmon> I\'d glossed over that in my reading...
2016-02-03T19:10:42 <Bosmon> Ok, I guess we can make that bit happen automatically too
2016-02-03T19:11:22 <Bosmon> That is - the new behaviour will be that the DOM binder, when it detects it has matched an iframe node, will automatically resolve that to the contained document node, hosted by the correct jQuery
2016-02-03T19:12:06 <Bosmon> Well
2016-02-03T19:12:12 <Bosmon> Perhaps this is just all a bit too magic
2016-02-03T19:12:26 <Bosmon> I can just fix up your expander to resolve the right jQuery, I guess
2016-02-03T19:13:41 <Justin_o> Bosmon: we also need to know when iframe\'s contents have loaded
2016-02-03T19:13:51 <Bosmon> Justin_o - right
2016-02-03T19:14:03 * kasparnet has quit

2016-02-03T20:10:06 <Justin_o> Bosmon: and evil pull request
2016-02-03T20:10:19 <Bosmon> Oh yes
2016-02-03T20:10:32 <Bosmon> I was going to say it is moderately evil, but not THAT evil : P
2016-02-03T20:10:35 <Bosmon> But now I see the number
2016-02-03T20:11:37 <Justin_o> Bosmon: :) thanks for the fix though i\'ll try to take a look at that in a bit

2016-02-03T20:39:58 <colinclark> Hey fluid-everyone, I just merged a pretty awesome pull request from avtar a few minutes ago, which you may find useful...
2016-02-03T20:40:09 <michelled> yay! what is it?
2016-02-03T20:40:21 <colinclark> You can now run all unit tests in all the browsers installed on your computer with one command
2016-02-03T20:40:33 <michelled> !
2016-02-03T20:40:47 <colinclark> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion#run-tests-using-browsers-installed-on-your-computer
2016-02-03T20:41:07 <colinclark> And if you\'d like, you can also run them in a Linux virtual machine
2016-02-03T20:41:08 <colinclark> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion#run-tests-using-browsers-installed-in-a-vm
2016-02-03T20:41:25 <colinclark> Eventually, we\'ll also have support for doing so in a set of Sauce Labs VMs
2016-02-03T20:41:30 <colinclark> and in local Windows vagrant boxes
2016-02-03T20:41:41 <colinclark> but it sure will make reviewing pull requests much easier
2016-02-03T20:41:51 <colinclark> in that you can just run one command and let it go

2016-02-03T16:46:32 <kasparnet> in some places
2016-02-03T16:46:41 <kasparnet> and         jqUnit = fluid.registerNamespace("jqUnit"),
2016-02-03T16:46:43 <kasparnet> in others
2016-02-03T16:46:58 <kasparnet> Bosmon: is there a reason/system in when what should be used
2016-02-03T16:47:04 <kasparnet> or is one of them outdated?
2016-02-03T16:47:04 <Bosmon> One of those loads jqUnit, and the other one just gets access to it if you know someone else has loaded it
2016-02-03T16:47:14 <kasparnet> ah
2016-02-03T16:47:38 <Bosmon> alanharnum - I\'m sorry for your TIM HORTON\'S EXPERIENCE of yesterday : P
2016-02-03T16:48:00 <alanharnum> Bosmon: it\'s something i accept as part of the whole Tim\'s experience
2016-02-03T16:48:21 <alanharnum> "the web of my thumb and forefinger is burned, i must have got coffee from tim horton\'s"

2016-02-03T16:49:18 <kasparnet> Bosmon: so, something like: OntologyHandlerTests.js uses the registerNamespace version
2016-02-03T16:49:35 <kasparnet> but runing that test alone, I dont see where else the jqUnit would be loaded
2016-02-03T16:50:44 <Bosmon> kasparnet - it comes from kettle.loadTestingSupport

2016-02-03T16:58:46 <Justin_o> Bosmon: sure i\'ll take a look
2016-02-03T16:59:53 <alanharnum> Bosmon: that was my conclusion as well, hence not going to 3/4 of it and changing my major away from English/Philosophy to straight-up English Literature Specialist
2016-02-03T17:00:18 <alanharnum> which informs my practice as a developer by helping me think of relevant poems to current problem spaces

2016-02-03T17:02:00 <Justin_o> Bosmon: haha i remember that
2016-02-03T17:09:52 <Justin_o> Bosmon: left a couple of comments on the FLUID-5821 pull request

2016-02-03T17:11:08 <Bosmon> Thanks, Justin_o
2016-02-03T17:20:17 <Justin_o> cindyli: were you expecting to add the export button to the pull down tab under FLUID-5837 or a separate JIRA/
2016-02-03T17:20:19 <Justin_o> ?
2016-02-03T17:21:06 <cindyli> Justin_o: i\'m fine with either way. do you have a preference?
2016-02-03T17:21:18 <Justin_o> cindyli: not really, just curious about what the plan was
2016-02-03T17:21:42 <Justin_o> cindyli: also here\'s the rough code we talked about for fluid.prefs.create

2016-02-03T17:21:53 * Yan_Hu joined the channel
2016-02-03T17:22:27 <Justin_o> and the related JIRA https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5817
2016-02-03T17:22:58 <cindyli> thanks, Justin_o, the initial plan was to use a separate jira. but in this way, we\'ll need to maintain that branch which seems will be based off the branch 5837
2016-02-03T17:23:18 <cindyli> considering the current state of 5837, that branch might have to be long time pending
2016-02-03T17:23:55 <Justin_o> cindyli: yes, that\'s true, but I could create a new JIRA anyways, and work out of the same branch
2016-02-03T17:24:13 <cindyli> sounds good, Justin_o

2016-02-03T17:28:08 <Justin_o> cindyli: will do

2016-02-03T18:39:15 <Bosmon> Hi there Justin_o - bad news about FLUID-5846
2016-02-03T18:39:26 <Bosmon> I can make the tests pass, but I fear that the implementation itself will not work
2016-02-03T18:39:41 <Bosmon> It looks like the jQuery UI tooltips plugin is riddled with assumptions about which document the tooltip is in
2016-02-03T18:40:02 * colinclark joined the channel
2016-02-03T18:40:51 <Bosmon> It uses this completely boneheaded strategy to find its tooltips: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/lib/jquery/ui/js/jquery.ui.tooltip.js#L371
2016-02-03T18:41:00 <Bosmon> and https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/lib/jquery/ui/js/jquery.ui.tooltip.js#L391
2016-02-03T18:41:51 <Bosmon> So unfortunately what I said last week is not really true - we really will have to continue to load jQuery in every iframe that we use
