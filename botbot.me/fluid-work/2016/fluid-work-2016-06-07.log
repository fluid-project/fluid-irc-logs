2016-06-07T15:52:59 <cindyli> if i run "npm install" within first-discovery-server/, the log is http://pastebin.com/DTDrhcAN, meaning, duplicate infusion
2016-06-07T15:55:42 <Justin_o> cindyli: try running "npm run fullinstall"
2016-06-07T15:56:54 <Justin_o> that\'s what should be run when the vm is built
2016-06-07T15:56:55 <cindyli> Justin_o: kettle was pointing to one of Bosmon\'s kettle-32 commits, which has been merged into the master, not sure if the kettle master branch would be compatible with first-discovery-server code
2016-06-07T15:57:03 <cindyli> better stay with that commit
2016-06-07T15:59:09 <cindyli> Justin_o: i ran "npm run fullinstall", seems ok
2016-06-07T15:59:18 <cindyli> but hit error running "node index.js" afterwards
2016-06-07T16:00:09 <cindyli> Justin_o: wonder if you are able to start the first discovery server on ur machine?

2016-06-07T19:06:54 <aleiva> avtar: look
2016-06-07T19:06:55 <aleiva> (iii) to install, use and run up to two (2) additional copies or instances of the Apple Software
2016-06-07T19:06:59 <aleiva> within virtual operating system environments on each Mac Computer you own or control
2016-06-07T19:07:02 <aleiva> that is already running the Apple Software, for purposes of: (a) software development; (b)
2016-06-07T19:07:05 <aleiva> testing during software development; (c) using OS X Server; or (d) personal, noncommercial
2016-06-07T19:07:08 <aleiva> use.
2016-06-07T19:07:16 <aleiva> I think that means we are allow to store an osx image in hashicorp atlas
2016-06-07T19:07:28 <aleiva> if not is a pity because I have one created :(
2016-06-07T19:08:39 <amatas> aleiva, avtar it seems that running osx in apple hardware is allowed even if its virtualized
2016-06-07T19:08:57 <avtar> aleiva: yup
2016-06-07T19:09:07 <aleiva> the key question is
2016-06-07T19:09:16 <aleiva> is it allowed to store it in atlas?
2016-06-07T19:09:26 <aleiva> meanwhile the user have a mac?
2016-06-07T19:09:36 * wale has quit
2016-06-07T19:10:19 <aleiva> I\'m asking because at the moment seems better to adapt current ansible roles for osx using a vagrant box
2016-06-07T19:10:31 <aleiva> and maybe later adapt it for local configuration through ansible
2016-06-07T19:11:05 <amatas> aleiva, avtar perhaps we can distribute the vms in box files, instead using atlas.
2016-06-07T19:12:20 <aleiva> the effect is the same
2016-06-07T19:12:43 <aleiva> no?
2016-06-07T19:13:25 <avtar> since instances of os x aren\'t associated with serial numbers/activation keys it seems to me that a publicly hosted box (using atlas or on any web server) should be usable by anyone with an os x dev/test machine
2016-06-07T19:14:39 <avtar> aleiva, amatas: https://atlas.hashicorp.com/boxes/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&sort=&provider=virtualbox&q=os+x
2016-06-07T19:16:12 <aleiva> yes, there\'s a lot of them
2016-06-07T19:16:22 <amatas> wow: 10,147 downloads | 10.11.5 | last release 20 days ago
2016-06-07T19:18:38 <the-t-in-rtf> @cindyli or @Bosmon, I expanded on your work with infusion to add ESLint and modern grunt to infusion:  https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/pull/23
2016-06-07T19:19:15 <cindyli> that\'s fast, thanks, the-t-in-rtf
2016-06-07T19:19:16 <the-t-in-rtf> I can\'t assign it.
2016-06-07T19:19:32 <the-t-in-rtf> I am still halfway on European time, I started working at 5:00
2016-06-07T19:19:34 <Justin_o> cindyli: did you get the FD Server working?
2016-06-07T19:19:36 <the-t-in-rtf> :P

2016-06-07T19:19:58 <cindyli> no, Justin_o, since i\'m in a rush :)
2016-06-07T19:20:52 <avtar> aleiva: regarding what you said earlier: "and maybe later adapt it for local configuration through ansible"
2016-06-07T19:21:05 <avtar> http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_installation.html#control-machine-requirements
2016-06-07T19:22:04 <avtar> it looks like we can run ansible locally on os x (which is how we use it to set up fedora for gpii/linux) so the switch between vagrant or a physical os x machine won\'t be significant
2016-06-07T19:27:30 * colinclark joined the channel
2016-06-07T19:27:35 <aleiva> yes, but in the linux one you are relying in the existance of the vagrant user, right?
2016-06-07T19:27:39 <aleiva> I would like to avoid that
2016-06-07T19:28:14 <avtar> it relies on a vagrant account as long as vagrant boxes are used
2016-06-07T19:29:09 <avtar> but on a physical machine we can use any account as long as the user has admin level access using sudo
2016-06-07T19:29:49 <cindyli> just noticed a mistake, Justin_o, i meant to say "i\'m not in a rush", it\'s nice to have first discovery tool integration demo set up in case we need to show it, but it\'s ok not having it since we can show screenshots. don\'t worry if it\'s end of your day
2016-06-07T19:33:22 <Justin_o> cindyli: i\'ll be in the office tomorrow, maybe we can pair up a bit. It\'s working on my machine right now, but it could have something to do with an updated dependency

2016-06-07T20:02:43 <the-t-in-rtf> I also added the lint checker settings to the linting process.
2016-06-07T20:03:06 <the-t-in-rtf> Notably, it also changes the "strict" setting as I discussed with Antranig earlier.

2016-06-07T14:16:45 <Justin_o> Bosmon: PaliwalSparsh has shown me that you can add styling to console log messages. https://gist.github.com/PaliwalSparsh/248c88fb028d5ad9b4b1388419021873#file-fun-js  I wonder if this could be useful for some of our logging in Infusion.
2016-06-07T14:17:58 <PaliwalSparsh> I wrote the blog for week 2 of my journey here, in case someone wants to have a look here is the link -

2016-06-07T14:47:56 <cindyli> Justin_o: can you refresh my memory of how to start the first discovery server locally on my machine? I\'ve started gpii cloud based server on 8081 port.
2016-06-07T14:48:47 <cindyli> the readme of first-discovery-server talks about using vm or docker. I wonder if there\'s an easy way by running one command pointing to a config file to start the first discovery server?
2016-06-07T14:49:43 <Justin_o> yah.. i usually use the vm.. the docker container was for the deployment in the data centre in general
2016-06-07T14:51:10 <cindyli> ok, trying vm. thanks, Justin_o
2016-06-07T14:53:09 <Justin_o> cindyli: sorry, in a call but this should be enough assuming you have vagrant and the box already on your system https://github.com/GPII/first-discovery-server#working-with-the-vm
2016-06-07T14:54:57 <cindyli> Justin_o: updating my vm to the new version. will try it once that is done
2016-06-07T14:55:09 <Justin_o> okay, let me know how that goes

2016-06-07T15:42:40 <cindyli> Justin_o, avtar, failed at starting the first discovery server using vm. the log from http://127.0.0.1:19531/entries?_EXE=/usr/bin/node&follow complains about the duplicate infusion.
2016-06-07T15:43:21 <cindyli> what i did, 1. update the first discovery master
2016-06-07T15:43:26 <cindyli> 2. rm -rf node_modules/
2016-06-07T15:43:30 <cindyli> 3. npm install
2016-06-07T15:43:33 <cindyli> 4. vagrant up
2016-06-07T15:44:06 <avtar> cindyli: i don\'t think you need to run \'npm install\' on the host before starting the vm
2016-06-07T15:44:40 <cindyli> avtar: ok, i will redo "rm -rf node_modules/"

2016-06-07T15:46:24 <cindyli> avtar: without node_modules/, "vagrant up" complains about the missing kettle
2016-06-07T15:47:09 <avtar> cindyli: just to confirm, you\'re using the master branch of this repository? https://github.com/GPII/first-discovery-server
2016-06-07T15:47:11 <cindyli> avtar, Justin_o, i assume i don\'t need to start gpii flow manager separately, right?
2016-06-07T15:47:16 <cindyli> yes, avtar
2016-06-07T15:47:36 <cindyli> i rely on the vm to start both flow manager and first discovery server, is that correct, avtar and Justin_o
2016-06-07T15:48:09 <Justin_o> cindyli: no it only handles the first discovery server, you\'d have to start up the other gpii related servers separately
2016-06-07T15:48:29 <cindyli> ok, Justin_o
2016-06-07T15:49:14 <cindyli> i tried starting or not starting the gpii server separately, doesn\'t help, hitting errors in both cases
2016-06-07T15:49:14 <Justin_o> did you get the fd server started?
2016-06-07T15:49:18 <cindyli> no
2016-06-07T15:49:29 <cindyli> that\'s the problem
2016-06-07T15:49:53 <Justin_o> the fd server should start without the gpii server running, but it won\'t save any preferences
2016-06-07T15:50:01 <Justin_o> what errors are you getting?
2016-06-07T15:51:06 <cindyli> if i don\'t run "npm install" in the first-discovery-server/ folder, the log from http://127.0.0.1:19531/entries?_EXE=/usr/bin/node&follow is - http://pastebin.com/9jbnjU5Q
2016-06-07T15:51:07 * PaliwalSparsh has quit
2016-06-07T15:51:14 <cindyli> basically, missing kettle
2016-06-07T15:52:42 <Justin_o> cindyli: can you double check the package.json to see where kettle is coming from
