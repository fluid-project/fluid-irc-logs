2016-12-04T22:19:38 <sgithens> Bosmon Bosmon5 : one of my hack items this week is to start hacking with having all the datasources in the local flow manager just call each other instead of making HTTP calls on the local system. Have we chatted much about that, or have an initial idea of what has to done for that to just work
2016-12-04T22:19:56 <sgithens> maybe it will be as simple as toggling a config item somewhere
2016-12-04T22:20:11 <Bosmon> sgithens - this is in theory relatively simple work
2016-12-04T22:20:19 <Bosmon> Involving the construction of a "direct function call dataSource"
2016-12-04T22:21:32 <Bosmon> There are some very ancient notes on this here: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Notes+on+Kettle#NotesonKettle-DATASOURCESANDURLSWITHINKETTLE
2016-12-04T22:21:43 <Bosmon> Search for the words "This is also not what should happen" : P
2016-12-04T22:21:50 <sgithens> hhahahah
2016-12-04T22:21:51 <sgithens> ok
2016-12-04T22:21:58 * colinclark joined the channel
2016-12-04T22:21:59 <Bosmon> A lot seemed to happen in 2014
2016-12-04T22:22:06 <sgithens> do you know if we have any existing tickets for this work?
2016-12-04T22:22:13 <Bosmon> colinclark and simonbates and I have talked about this from time to time
2016-12-04T22:22:30 <colinclark> Bosmon!
2016-12-04T22:22:35 <colinclark> you\'re here, virtually!
2016-12-04T22:22:41 <sgithens> This is part of my hack item of finally reviving my nodejs nfc code for the user listener this week
2016-12-04T22:22:42 <Bosmon> HERR DR PROF HABIL!
2016-12-04T22:22:55 <sgithens> which I would also like to not go over the network if possible
2016-12-04T22:23:11 <sgithens> for our HARDWARE VERIFICATION
2016-12-04T22:23:13 <Bosmon> sgithens - although the "electron-ipc dataSource" is a natural partner to this work too
2016-12-04T22:23:16 <sgithens> sent to HUNDREDS
2016-12-04T22:23:39 <Bosmon> I don\'t think there are any tickets for this work
2016-12-04T22:23:49 <Bosmon> Just occasional mumblings in wiki pages and arch meeting minutes
2016-12-04T22:24:48 <sgithens> are the DS API\'s all in kettle, or do some live in infusion too?
2016-12-04T22:25:16 <colinclark> HARDWARE SENSITIVITY TESTING
2016-12-04T22:27:45 <Bosmon> sgithens - still all currently Kettle
2016-12-04T22:27:56 <Bosmon> Work to lift them up is described here: https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5900
2016-12-04T22:28:08 <sgithens> Bosmon: cool, thanks
