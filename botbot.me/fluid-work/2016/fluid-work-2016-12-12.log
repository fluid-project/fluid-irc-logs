2016-12-12T16:14:03 <danayo> Justin_o: I don\'t think there were any notes about that discussion - and I didn\'t make much myself - I don\'t think we talked in much detail about all the possibilities for what would be tagged
2016-12-12T16:21:35 <jhung> Justin_o: I updated https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/pull/109
2016-12-12T16:24:09 <colinclark> Justin_o: Can you arrange to update the Fluid website news with information about the 2.0 release?
2016-12-12T16:24:36 <colinclark> and perhaps we can put an Infusion "Featured Work" square on the home page?

2016-12-12T17:17:59 <Justin_o> colinclark: sure, i\'m planning to not officially announce until the infusion-docs are tagged though
2016-12-12T17:18:08 <Justin_o> and the UIO WP plugin is updated
2016-12-12T17:18:26 <colinclark> that\'s cool
2016-12-12T17:18:37 <colinclark> but when you do, right?
2016-12-12T17:19:41 <Justin_o> colinclark: yes :)
2016-12-12T17:20:02 <colinclark> awesome, thank you!
2016-12-12T17:20:43 <Justin_o> colinclark: what did you want  for the infusion square
2016-12-12T17:21:44 <Justin_o> colinclark: for example, what should it link to.. the demo? documentation? the "Infusion" page the fluid project site, something else
2016-12-12T17:21:59 <colinclark> I think probably the latter
2016-12-12T17:22:00 <Justin_o> demos would be the build site i guess
2016-12-12T17:22:04 <colinclark> but what do you recommend?
2016-12-12T17:22:17 <Justin_o> when you say latter, you mean "something else"
2016-12-12T17:22:18 <Justin_o> ?
2016-12-12T17:22:28 <colinclark> oh no, sorry
2016-12-12T17:22:30 <colinclark> :)
2016-12-12T17:22:40 <colinclark> " the "Infusion" page the fluid project site"
2016-12-12T17:23:14 <Justin_o> colinclark: okay, sure that should work
2016-12-12T17:23:29 <Justin_o> should we drop any of the boxes currently there
2016-12-12T17:24:06 <colinclark> I think we could probably swap out the Feedback demo at very least
2016-12-12T17:24:12 <Justin_o> okay
2016-12-12T17:24:28 <colinclark> Most of the things on the Fluid site should be highlights of the Floe Project site
2016-12-12T17:24:35 <colinclark> just to keep it active and full of stuff
2016-12-12T17:24:44 <colinclark> I think we probably already have them on there
2016-12-12T17:24:59 <colinclark> whereas it would be great if the Fluid site highlighted basically our awesomest stuff, across projects
2016-12-12T17:25:55 <Justin_o> colinclark: okay, anything else we might want to put up there as well, while we\'re making the change
2016-12-12T17:26:09 <Justin_o> maybe something GPII related?
2016-12-12T17:26:25 <colinclark> if you can think of anything, that might be cool
2016-12-12T17:26:29 <colinclark> the FD Tool, perhaps
2016-12-12T17:27:07 <Justin_o> Ah okay, yes, that makes sense
2016-12-12T17:27:33 <Justin_o> maybe i\'ll swap metadata for that

2016-12-12T17:57:04 <Justin_o> gtirloni: do you know if there is a vagrant setup for developing the UIO wordpress plugin?
2016-12-12T17:57:12 <Justin_o> jhung: ^
2016-12-12T17:57:35 <gtirloni> there isn\'t one
2016-12-12T17:58:38 <gtirloni> you\'d have to start from a vanilla centos7 and install php on it
2016-12-12T17:59:14 <gtirloni> i think that\'s what jhung have? i started doing some work to support php but it got stalled due to other priorities

2016-12-12T17:59:50 <Justin_o> gtirloni: thanks for the info
2016-12-12T18:00:35 <Justin_o> gtirloni: when you have time to work on the php support again we should add vagrant to this repo https://github.com/fluid-project/uio-wordpress-plugin
2016-12-12T18:00:51 <Justin_o> i\'ve gotten so spoiled :)

2016-12-12T18:02:55 <gtirloni> colinclark amatas gloob_ avtar: i vaguely remember i started to work on PHP support for the QI infrastructure sometimes last year but it wasn\'t clear how much demand there was for it.. I guess this was in the context of P4A but it got naturally abandoned due to other priorities. Is it something that still fits the work for P4A/QI ?
2016-12-12T18:05:45 <gtirloni> (sorry if i\'m mixing different projects and people here.. i\'m not fully aware of where one stops and the other begins)
2016-12-12T18:07:00 <amatas> gtirloni, I don\'t remember any application that needs PHP besides Mediawiki
2016-12-12T18:07:44 <gtirloni> yeah, but in the context of what developers need for their development environments
2016-12-12T18:07:57 <gtirloni> for developing GPII apps and inclusive apps
2016-12-12T18:10:06 <gtirloni> if we can clarify if PHP support is in the scope of these projects, then I know where to open a JIRA :)

2016-12-12T18:42:04 <colinclark> and it would be, as you say, coming more from the P4A side of things
2016-12-12T18:42:20 <colinclark> but when it comes to the APCP, not so much

2016-12-12T20:44:13 <gtirloni> the project directory gets mounted /home/vagrant/sync
2016-12-12T20:44:36 <Justin_o> gtirloni: does it automatically update, or do i need to reprovision?
2016-12-12T20:44:53 <gtirloni> it automatically updates (because it\'s using virtualbox shared folders)
2016-12-12T20:44:54 <Justin_o> want to work on a plugin and just let it sit in the synced directory

2016-12-12T16:00:04 <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: anythoughts on what should be included in this ( https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6062 ), that is, what types of things should be marked with tag... absolutely everything?
2016-12-12T16:00:26 <Justin_o> meaning, everything that has been added and etc.. in some cases that might be most of a page
2016-12-12T16:00:45 <Justin_o> or possible an entire page i guess... also i'll need help with figuring out what all the changes are
2016-12-12T16:04:05 <Justin_o> jhung: do you know if we keep notes from the design crits
2016-12-12T16:04:38 <jhung> yes Justin_o. If there are any notes, they'll go into the design crit page on the wiki.
