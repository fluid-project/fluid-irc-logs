b'2016-12-16T15:01:53 <simonjb> thanks the-t-in-rtf and Bosmon -- if I add var jqUnit = require("node-jqunit") I now get "Failure in fixture file - no tests were queued"
2016-12-16T15:02:00 <the-t-in-rtf> I thought you meant cell phone signal until I read the second half of the sentence.
2016-12-16T15:02:11 <colinclark> !
2016-12-16T15:02:20 <the-t-in-rtf> I copied and pasted your example into a project, all I needed was that one line.
2016-12-16T15:02:25 <the-t-in-rtf> which version of infusion are you using?
2016-12-16T15:02:27 <the-t-in-rtf> and node?
2016-12-16T15:02:53 <simonjb> infusion 2.0.0 node 6.9.1
2016-12-16T15:03:09 <the-t-in-rtf> I\'m using node 6.9.1 and a dev release of 2.0.0, just a second.
2016-12-16T15:03:18 <simonjb> thanks the-t-in-rtf
2016-12-16T15:04:29 <the-t-in-rtf> This works fine for me, just your code with the require: http://pastie.org/10983332
2016-12-16T15:05:11 <the-t-in-rtf> (with 2.0.0 and 6.9.1)
2016-12-16T15:05:24 <the-t-in-rtf> and node-jqunit 1.1.4
2016-12-16T15:06:48 * clown joined the channel
2016-12-16T15:06:57 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - I suspect the issue might be that if you include node-jqunit, you do not then also run "fluid.loadTestingSupport"
2016-12-16T15:07:10 <Bosmon> I wonder if there is a timing issue resulting from loading the code twice...
2016-12-16T15:07:18 <colinclark> Bosmon: So what time are we meeting with simonjb?
2016-12-16T15:07:33 <simonjb> aha -- the require node-jqunit has to go after the loadTestingSupport()
2016-12-16T15:07:46 <Bosmon> simonjb - the loadTestingSupport can be removed entirely
2016-12-16T15:07:52 <Bosmon> Since this happens inside node-jqunit
2016-12-16T15:08:05 <Bosmon> I suspect the problem is caused by issuing it again after the one in the module
2016-12-16T15:08:06 <simonjb> yep
2016-12-16T15:08:19 <simonjb> thanks the-t-in-rtf and Bosmon
2016-12-16T15:08:23 <Bosmon> I guess we should have some kind of multiple execution guard inside this function
2016-12-16T15:08:42 <Bosmon> Just like in the ancient days of C HEADER FILES : P
2016-12-16T15:09:16 <Bosmon> Do you think you could assign a JIRA to me for this, cheers!
2016-12-16T15:09:21 <simonjb> and the variable must be called exactly jqUnit
2016-12-16T15:10:53 <simonjb> so, if I replace the "fluid.loadTestingSupport();" with "var jqUnit = require("node-jqunit");" it works
2016-12-16T15:12:16 <Bosmon> Yes, in theory the variable name is irrelevant, since the module always loads its definitions to the global namespace name "jqUnit"
2016-12-16T15:12:22 <Bosmon> But you will need some kind of local name to gain access to them
2016-12-16T15:12:26 <Bosmon> And you may as well use "jqUnit"
2016-12-16T15:12:53 <Bosmon> It would be awkward to then subsequently write var otherThing = fluid.registerNamespace("jqUnit") .....
2016-12-16T15:13:33 <Bosmon> I guess all of this hugely violates the general node religion against having a correlation between local and global names
2016-12-16T15:13:40 <Bosmon> But then I guess any use of global names violates this anyway
2016-12-16T15:14:15 <simonjb> ah, yes, of course
2016-12-16T15:16:06 <colinclark> Bosmon, Bosmon, Bosmon
2016-12-16T15:16:13 <colinclark> can we set a time to meet with simonjb?
2016-12-16T15:16:32 <colinclark> I\'m hoping I might get to go for a swim before I return to the Land Of Blizzards
2016-12-16T15:16:48 <colinclark> so scheduling a meeting time is conducive to swimming
2016-12-16T15:18:21 * lliskovoi joined the channel
2016-12-16T15:18:39 <simonjb> Bosmon, colinclark: any time is good for me
2016-12-16T15:19:35 <Bosmon> Ok
2016-12-16T15:19:38 <Bosmon> I can meet in about 40 mins
2016-12-16T15:19:47 <Bosmon> Although in theory I am backlogged from failing to meet with the-t-in-rtf
2016-12-16T15:19:53 <colinclark> so 11 am EDT\xe2\x80\x94sounds great
2016-12-16T15:19:54 <Bosmon> I need to do essentials like washing, breakfast
2016-12-16T15:19:58 <colinclark> oh yes
2016-12-16T15:20:01 <colinclark> those are good too
2016-12-16T15:20:31 <the-t-in-rtf> in practice I have already given up on our talk for the day.
2016-12-16T15:20:42 <colinclark> :)
2016-12-16T15:20:57 <the-t-in-rtf> I can move to early next week, I would rather get the feedback when I have a week ahead of me to apply it.
2016-12-16T15:21:08 <colinclark> thanks the-t-in-rtf
2016-12-16T15:21:09 <the-t-in-rtf> is there a slot on Monday that is tolerable?
2016-12-16T15:21:15 <the-t-in-rtf> @Bosmon
2016-12-16T15:21:21 <colinclark> this means I can officially call it a beach day this afternoon
2016-12-16T15:21:41 <cindyli> Bosmon: can you fill up your time slots for the next security meeting - http://doodle.com/poll/bubbn64rmvs8z2iq
2016-12-16T15:21:56 <colinclark> poor Bosmon is so popular!
2016-12-16T15:22:09 <simonjb> poor Bosmon!
2016-12-16T15:23:07 <simonjb> 11am Eastern is good for me to chat
2016-12-16T15:24:06 <colinclark> great, simonjb
2016-12-16T15:24:17 <colinclark> and then I guess you\'ll probably do some sunbathing there, too?
2016-12-16T15:24:53 <colinclark> head to the beach in Belfast
2016-12-16T15:25:42 <cindyli> seems poor Bosmon is gone for essentials.
2016-12-16T15:25:43 <cindyli> simonjb, colinclark, when you meet him at 11, could you remind him to fill up the doodle?
2016-12-16T15:25:51 <colinclark> hahaha
2016-12-16T15:25:56 <colinclark> yes, will do
2016-12-16T15:25:58 <cindyli> thanks
2016-12-16T15:26:14 <simonjb> colinclark: yeah, I\'ll just need to bring my sun, err, rain, umbrella
2016-12-16T15:29:17 <colinclark> hahaha
2016-12-16T15:29:22 <colinclark> is it rainy there, simonjb?
2016-12-16T15:30:10 <simonjb> it\'s stopped now but was raining this morning
2016-12-16T15:30:31 <colinclark> I saw a dophin this morning
2016-12-16T15:30:43 <simonjb> very nice
2016-12-16T15:30:50 <simonjb> in what environment?
2016-12-16T15:31:00 <colinclark> in the gulf of mexico
2016-12-16T15:31:07 <colinclark> it had a fin
2016-12-16T15:31:16 <simonjb> from a boat?
2016-12-16T15:31:26 <simonjb> or from the shore?
2016-12-16T15:35:15 <colinclark> from my office :)
2016-12-16T15:35:26 <colinclark> i was just sort of gazing out there
2016-12-16T15:35:29 <colinclark> and then a fin appeared
2016-12-16T15:36:14 * sirdancealot joined the channel
2016-12-16T16:05:02 <michelled> Justin_o, colinclark: do you have opinions on the state of our \'simply\' UIO option? do you think we could use it in a page that we have created and control the content for?
2016-12-16T16:05:36 <colinclark> do you mean Simplify, michelled?
2016-12-16T16:05:44 <michelled> (other people opinions are also welcome :)
2016-12-16T16:05:50 <michelled> yes, I do  mean simplify
2016-12-16T16:05:57 <colinclark> and yes, I suspect it\'s at least vaguely usable in cases where we\'ve created the page
2016-12-16T16:06:13 <colinclark> If I remember correctly, it depends mostly on the presence of a <main> tag
2016-12-16T16:06:24 <colinclark> probably the biggest issue with it is like this:
2016-12-16T16:06:40 <colinclark> If you simplify the page, how do you navigate to other pages?
2016-12-16T16:07:10 <colinclark> so we probably need some means for accessing the content we elide
2016-12-16T16:07:12 <michelled> yeah - also, I wonder what it mean to simplify a page if it\'s responsive and we are already designing for a small screen and therefore less content
2016-12-16T16:07:14 <colinclark> or linearizing it somehow
2016-12-16T16:07:31 <colinclark> yeah, exactly
2016-12-16T16:09:20 <Bosmon> colinclark, simonjb - sorry guys - haven\'t managed to get to breakfast yet - can we go for 11.30?
2016-12-16T16:09:53 <colinclark> yep
2016-12-16T16:09:56 <simonjb> fine for me
2016-12-16T16:29:56 <Justin_o> michelled, colinclark: sorry just catching up... it\'s based on a tag, maybe <article> so it\'s kind of like the browsers reader mode
2016-12-16T16:30:20 * sirdancealot has quit
2016-12-16T16:30:25 <Justin_o> that could probably be configured, but i think it is worthwhile thinking about what you\'d want the simplification to do on the page
2016-12-16T16:30:40 <Justin_o> colinclark: not sure if you saw, but i replied to your comment about the dist builds
2016-12-16T16:30:51 <colinclark> I didn\'t see that, no
2016-12-16T16:30:53 <Justin_o> perhaps it\'s something we could talk about at the Infusion review on wednesday
2016-12-16T16:30:58 <colinclark> sure
2016-12-16T16:31:38 * alanharnum has quit
2016-12-16T16:32:03 <colinclark> Just looking at your response, I think this is less an issue of categorization and more one of omissin :)
2016-12-16T16:32:28 <colinclark> omission
2016-12-16T16:32:32 <colinclark> I mean, it makes perfect sense that things like the preferences framework is distinct from "the Infusion framework"
2016-12-16T16:32:55 <colinclark> but I imagine ContextAwareness.js is sufficienltly part of "core" as you describe it
2016-12-16T16:33:02 <colinclark> but who knows? :)
2016-12-16T16:33:05 <Justin_o> colinclark: categorization in that it\'s called the framework build, and uses what\'s in the framework module, which is just core
2016-12-16T16:33:14 <Justin_o> so maybe a renaming there
2016-12-16T16:34:35 <Justin_o> colinclark: i\'m not sure, but i\'m not also not sure why it is in a different directory than core..  is there a reason it isn\'t combined, maybe we could just move it inside the core directory
2016-12-16T16:35:00 * stegru joined the channel
2016-12-16T16:35:20 <colinclark> I guess my point was that, from the perspective of a user, the location of a file is only notable if it\'s not included ;)
2016-12-16T16:36:22 <Justin_o> but i\'d guess it\'s confusing to call something framework but it only includes core and there is a distinction between all the different framework parts.. and then i think it would be more confusing if some stuff is included with core and others aren\'t
2016-12-16T16:36:31 <Justin_o> this is more about the module names i guess
2016-12-16T16:36:54 <Bosmon> colinclark, simonjb
2016-12-16T16:36:55 <Bosmon> ok!
2016-12-16T16:37:11 <colinclark> simonjb: your room?
2016-12-16T16:37:23 <simonjb> unlocked
2016-12-16T16:38:01 <Justin_o> colinclark: anyways, i guess we can chat more about it on wednesday.
2016-12-16T16:38:11 <simonjb> colinclark, Bosmon: my room is good
2016-12-16T16:38:48 <colinclark> sure, Justin_o

2016-12-16T18:33:55 <colinclark> so that I could show the reviewers in Luxembourg a recording

2016-12-16T14:35:34 <simonjb> colinclark: yes, that would be good for me
2016-12-16T14:35:55 <simonjb> is it today Bosmon that is moving?
2016-12-16T14:36:08 <colinclark> Bosmon has moved
2016-12-16T14:36:13 <simonjb> cool
2016-12-16T14:36:17 <colinclark> with some hilarity, I think
2016-12-16T14:36:33 <colinclark> He seemed up for meeting when I spoke with him last night
2016-12-16T14:36:39 <simonjb> awesome
2016-12-16T14:39:17 <simonjb> BTW, has anyone successfully run IoC tests using fluid.test.runTests() under node?
2016-12-16T14:39:27 <simonjb> I must just be missing something simple
2016-12-16T14:39:55 <simonjb> but all I see is "Successfully queued test" with no test results
2016-12-16T14:40:21 <cindyli> simonjb: not yet, waiting on Bosmon\'s available time slots
2016-12-16T14:40:31 <simonjb> cool, thanks cindyli
2016-12-16T14:41:37 <the-t-in-rtf> @simonjb, I have written and run tens of thousands of IoC tests under node.
2016-12-16T14:41:45 <the-t-in-rtf> Using fluid.test.runTests
2016-12-16T14:41:52 <the-t-in-rtf> if you send me a link to what you\'re working on, I am happy to review
2016-12-16T14:42:16 * alanharnum joined the channel
2016-12-16T14:42:18 <simonjb> thanks the-t-in-rtf
2016-12-16T14:42:18 <the-t-in-rtf> well, maybe not written tens of thousands, but certainly run, you know what I mean.
2016-12-16T14:42:30 * michelled joined the channel
2016-12-16T14:42:42 <the-t-in-rtf> We should make a developer fitness app with tests written per day
2016-12-16T14:43:03 <the-t-in-rtf> I\'m just in fact trying out test sequences and elements with my newest tests
2016-12-16T14:43:13 <the-t-in-rtf> if anyone else is similarly experimenting, I would love to compare notes.
2016-12-16T14:43:39 <simonjb> the-t-in-rtf: https://gist.github.com/simonbates/826e345e6235533f9cf53d2b0614afb1
2016-12-16T14:43:53 <simonjb> from http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/IoCTestingFramework.html
2016-12-16T14:46:38 <the-t-in-rtf> you haven\'t wired your caseholder in as a component of your test environment
2016-12-16T14:46:49 <the-t-in-rtf> oh, sorry
2016-12-16T14:47:05 <the-t-in-rtf> I usually don\'t reference things before I write them in the file, just reading them upside down.
2016-12-16T14:47:08 <the-t-in-rtf> just a sec
2016-12-16T14:48:08 <the-t-in-rtf> I think that example is just plain missing something.  Just a sec.
2016-12-16T14:48:21 <the-t-in-rtf> I will pull a working example from the tests of our test framework to confirm.
2016-12-16T14:48:25 <simonjb> yeah, I figured something must be missing
2016-12-16T14:48:28 <simonjb> thanks the-t-in-rtf
2016-12-16T14:50:20 <Bosmon> Hi, looks like lots of interesting things going on :)
2016-12-16T14:50:23 <the-t-in-rtf> So, I almost always use this form: https://github.com/the-t-in-rtf/gpii-express/blob/master/tests/js/router/router-static-caseholder.js#L12
2016-12-16T14:50:24 <Bosmon> I just need to shower....
2016-12-16T14:50:43 <the-t-in-rtf> I believe the example either uses an alternate form or is missing the "sequence" bit.
2016-12-16T14:51:11 <colinclark> WE"RE ALL IOC TESTING
2016-12-16T14:51:12 <colinclark> ALL AT ONCE
2016-12-16T14:51:18 <the-t-in-rtf> so, the "func" and "args" bit should be inside an object, which itself should be inside a sequence block.
2016-12-16T14:51:33 <simonjb> I tested inside a sequence and same thing
2016-12-16T14:52:30 <simonjb> when we figure it out, I\'ll make a docs pull request :)
2016-12-16T14:52:50 <Bosmon> Hi simonjb - I can\'t tell what change you made in your gist from the example in the docs
2016-12-16T14:53:05 <simonjb> hopefully none :)
2016-12-16T14:53:12 <Bosmon> !
2016-12-16T14:54:49 <Bosmon> This is the version in the framework tests
2016-12-16T14:54:50 <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/tests/test-core/testTests/js/IoCTestingTests.js#L49
2016-12-16T14:54:52 <Bosmon> Which definitely runs
2016-12-16T14:55:09 <Bosmon> Perhaps you missed out some dependencies in package.json?
2016-12-16T14:56:19 <Bosmon> Well, I guess this suggestion doesn\'t make sense
2016-12-16T14:56:26 <Bosmon> The tests run perfectly well in a selfcontained way
2016-12-16T14:56:33 <Bosmon> If you run node tests/node-tests/basic-node-tests.js in the framework, you can see them going
2016-12-16T14:56:48 <simonjb> Bosmon: yes, but there\'s a lot more in that file
2016-12-16T14:56:54 <Bosmon> yes
2016-12-16T14:56:54 <simonjb> than in my gist
2016-12-16T14:57:18 <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/tests/node-tests/basic-node-tests.js#L84
2016-12-16T14:57:27 <the-t-in-rtf> ummm
2016-12-16T14:57:33 <the-t-in-rtf> did you require node-jqunit?
2016-12-16T14:57:58 <simonjb> I running against this package.json https://github.com/GPII/nexus/blob/master/package.json with infusion: 2.0.0
2016-12-16T14:58:08 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - that was my thought, but even that shouldn\'t be necessary
2016-12-16T14:58:10 <the-t-in-rtf> If I do that without assigning to a variable, I see the error
2016-12-16T14:58:12 <the-t-in-rtf> it is
2016-12-16T14:58:24 <Bosmon> "It should just work"
2016-12-16T14:58:28 <the-t-in-rtf> if you add var jqUnit = require("node-jqunit"), everything works.
2016-12-16T14:59:04 <Bosmon> Ah, simonjb
2016-12-16T14:59:09 <Bosmon> You forgot to execute QUnit.load()
2016-12-16T14:59:18 <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/tests/node-tests/basic-node-tests.js#L186
2016-12-16T14:59:29 <Bosmon> This is necessary to do manually, if you have not included node-jqunit
2016-12-16T14:59:42 <Bosmon> node-jqunit, really, should be part of the core framework
2016-12-16T14:59:43 <Bosmon> BUt it isn\'t
2016-12-16T14:59:55 <Bosmon> Just another of the things we plan after we have our "monorepo revolution"
