2016-10-24T15:18:58 <michelled1> danayo: do you have time to meet about privacy today?
2016-10-24T15:20:27 <alanharnum> michelled1: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/components/textfieldSlider/js/TextfieldSlider.js and https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/tests/component-tests/textToSpeech/js/TextToSpeechTests.js both contain examples; if you're looking at the TTS tests, you may also want to look at fluid.test.conditionalTestUtils.contextAwareTestRunner in https://github.com/fluid-project/infusio
2016-10-24T15:20:27 <alanharnum> n/blob/master/tests/test-core/utils/js/ConditionalTestUtils.js or its tests to understand what it's doing
2016-10-24T15:20:39 <michelled1> thx!
2016-10-24T15:20:55 <alanharnum> TextFieldSlider is probably the simplest example
2016-10-24T15:21:47 <danayo> michelled1: yes, I do! I was just trying to find the notes - do you know how we can access them?
2016-10-24T15:23:57 <michelled1> you mean from DEEP? https://docs.google.com/document/d/1An4VuigKDVscljHBCGPnJOFmwgl_OFyxwFOj1xocV58/edit#heading=h.xf9lfpg8drwa
2016-10-24T15:24:29 <danayo> yep thanks michel

2016-10-24T15:55:57 <jhung> michelled1: yep.
2016-10-24T15:56:15 <michelled1> are they considering have less accessible and more accessible themes?
2016-10-24T15:56:31 <michelled1> or reworking their existing themes to put accessibility into them?
2016-10-24T15:56:59 <jhung> michelled1: reworking themes.
2016-10-24T15:57:38 * cindyli has quit
2016-10-24T15:57:57 <jhung> michelled1: it may go beyond cosmetic as well and deal with the generation of those themes and injection of a11y features at the rendering stage. I'm not sure yet. Today will be the first meeting. I'll just be listening in for the most part.
2016-10-24T15:58:27 * cindyli joined the channel
2016-10-24T15:59:34 <michelled1> cool - I just had warning flags at the idea of accessible themes, but it sounds like you've got that considered :)

2016-10-24T18:16:40 <ewbjr> tried, let me restart
2016-10-24T18:19:09 <colinclark> ewbjr: Maybe just give me call on skype or on a telephone or whatever works?
2016-10-24T18:19:16 <ewbjr> weird, keeps saying you're busy and won't let me share my devices, skype or call?
2016-10-24T18:19:19 <ewbjr> sure
2016-10-24T18:19:35 <colinclark> I saw you connect\xe2\x80\x94it took a minute, but here you were, silently staring at me :P
