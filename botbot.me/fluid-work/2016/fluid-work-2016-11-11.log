b'2016-11-11T22:22:10 <Bosmon> Since you\'d always be otherwise tripping over something or other stupid relating to the way model relay works
2016-11-11T22:22:12 <Bosmon> colinclark - yes
2016-11-11T22:22:24 <Bosmon> And it would be "relaying components into existence" that would be our idiom for this
2016-11-11T22:22:32 <Bosmon> You can see the beginnings of this in my branch
2016-11-11T22:22:37 <colinclark> I\'d be curious to see your explorations, Bosmon
2016-11-11T22:22:50 <Bosmon> A set of "declarative rules for converting presence of model material at particular paths into component options"
2016-11-11T22:22:59 <colinclark> yes that would be great
2016-11-11T22:23:53 <Bosmon> Right now we just have these clunky makeXxxxxOptions functions like this: https://github.com/amb26/fluid-authoring/blob/FLUID-4884/src/js/ComponentGraph.js#L523
2016-11-11T22:24:05 <Bosmon> Which really aren\'t very much further along than their equivalents in kettle or gpii-express
2016-11-11T22:24:17 <Bosmon> But there are at least a couple more scaffolding planks surrounding them

b'2016-11-11T20:45:16 <Bosmon> But isn\'t it the case that the underlying idiom behind the problem is "freeform object allocation"?
2016-11-11T20:45:29 <Bosmon> Which is something that, in Infusionistic idioms, we generally frown on?
2016-11-11T20:45:44 <simonjb> well, it\'s infusion in as far as I want to use node-midi from infusion but I think it makes sense to fix in node-midi
2016-11-11T20:46:04 <Bosmon> If the objects are finite, I imagine that there should be some explicit idiom whereby one is given access to a PARTICULAR one of them rather than just "an instance in general"
2016-11-11T20:46:36 <Bosmon> This perhaps still isn\'t saying anything much
2016-11-11T20:47:06 <Bosmon> But when you say "makes sense to fix in node-midi", I\'m imagining that the other things you\'ve said suggest that this might be impossible, given JavaScript\'s standard object allocation idioms?
2016-11-11T20:47:44 * colinclark joined the channel
2016-11-11T20:48:17 <simonjb> initially I\'ve added an explicit "release()" method to free the underlying resource, similar maybe to closing a file
2016-11-11T20:49:28 <simonjb> but I\'m not sure that it\'s satisfactory
2016-11-11T20:50:00 <simonjb> another approach might be an object pool with objects that get re-used
2016-11-11T20:53:21 <colinclark> I agree with you simonjb that this might be better fixed at a lower level than node-midi\'s use with Infusion
2016-11-11T20:53:41 <colinclark> by the end of my next plane ride, MIDI Ports will be Infusion components
2016-11-11T20:54:02 <simonjb> there is a mismatch between the C++ object lifetime as resource management and the JavaScript gc object lifetime
2016-11-11T20:54:07 <colinclark> but I guess the problem is that, right now, there\'s nothing you could do in a component destroy listener to free up the underling RTMIDI object
2016-11-11T20:54:11 <colinclark> yes
2016-11-11T20:54:39 <simonjb> with the node-midi object construction equating the the RtMidiIn object creation
2016-11-11T20:55:06 <simonjb> but nothing equating to the RtMidiIn object destruction to free the resource
2016-11-11T20:55:28 <Bosmon> Yes
2016-11-11T20:55:44 <simonjb> with other resources, I think in JavaScript it\'s probably to use an open() close() pair
2016-11-11T20:55:44 <Bosmon> If we\'re dealing with a paradigm that is faulty because it has no destruction semantics, the resolution has to be to add them back in : P
2016-11-11T20:56:49 <simonjb> maybe it makes sense to add in a pair of methods to node-midi
2016-11-11T20:57:14 <simonjb> to allocate and free the underlying RtMidiIn object
2016-11-11T20:57:41 <simonjb> and break the mapping from JavaScript object to RtMidiIn object
2016-11-11T20:58:07 <simonjb> and least from the point of view of construction and object lifetime == resource
2016-11-11T20:58:42 <simonjb> but this would be a largish change to node-midi and I\'m just some new user of it :)
2016-11-11T20:59:57 * alanharn_ has quit
2016-11-11T21:00:27 <simonjb> it\'s either that or we try to use a minimum number of node-midi objects in a pool
2016-11-11T21:00:50 <simonjb> but there are separate issues with re-using node-midi objects
2016-11-11T21:00:56 <simonjb> which would need to be addressed
2016-11-11T21:01:12 <simonjb> https://github.com/justinlatimer/node-midi/issues/112
2016-11-11T21:03:12 <simonjb> I maybe makes sense to put in place some temporary fix for myself and try to start a conversation in a node-midi issue
2016-11-11T21:04:26 * clown has quit
2016-11-11T21:07:24 <simonjb> Bosmon: when you say to add destruction semantics back in, do you have a suggestion on how to best do that?
2016-11-11T21:08:06 * clown joined the channel
2016-11-11T21:21:34 <simonjb> colinclark: another option would be to change my usage pattern to minimize the use of node-midi objects
2016-11-11T21:22:01 <simonjb> either by changing flocking port object model or by not using flocking for the polling
2016-11-11T21:22:22 <simonjb> maybe we can chat next week when you\'re back
2016-11-11T21:22:45 <colinclark> I\'m certainly happy to
2016-11-11T21:23:04 <simonjb> awesome
2016-11-11T21:23:25 <colinclark> so remind me how node-midi\'s getPortCount() works
2016-11-11T21:23:34 <colinclark> So let\'s say I call it and get a count of ports
2016-11-11T21:23:41 <colinclark> and then I plug in a new device
2016-11-11T21:23:43 <colinclark> and call it again
2016-11-11T21:23:46 <colinclark> will it be correctly updated?
2016-11-11T21:23:50 <simonjb> yes
2016-11-11T21:24:46 <colinclark> And, again, we believe that an instance of a midi.input or midi.output corresponds directly to one "port," right?
2016-11-11T21:25:14 <simonjb> yes
2016-11-11T21:25:22 <colinclark> you instantiate, say, a midi.input, and you open a specified port, and at that point, the instance is bound forever and once to an underying midi port
2016-11-11T21:25:48 <simonjb> you can close() it but it cannot be re-used (in the current implementation)
2016-11-11T21:25:58 <colinclark> right
2016-11-11T21:26:02 <simonjb> and it doesn\'t free the underlying RtMidi object
2016-11-11T21:26:06 <colinclark> right
2016-11-11T21:26:15 <colinclark> so when I have the flock.midi.port component completed, its use of node-midi objects is "correct"
2016-11-11T21:27:02 * alanharnum joined the channel
2016-11-11T21:27:04 <simonjb> at the moment, our problem is that when we refresh the port list, we create new objects for each port
2016-11-11T21:27:08 <simonjb> https://github.com/colinbdclark/Flocking/blob/midi-improvements/src/nodejs/midi.js#L62
2016-11-11T21:27:33 <colinclark> yeah
2016-11-11T21:27:49 <simonjb> and if we do that relatively frequently, we soon run out of underlying ALSA resources
2016-11-11T21:27:53 <colinclark> so we should only be creating this things when we actually open a port, it sounds like
2016-11-11T21:28:12 <simonjb> yes, that is definitely a possible solution
2016-11-11T21:28:25 <simonjb> to change when we create the node-midi objects
2016-11-11T21:28:41 <colinclark> it sounds like the midi "system" component should represent ports in some simple modelized form
2016-11-11T21:28:44 <simonjb> do it more just-in-time, when we want to open a port
2016-11-11T21:28:54 <colinclark> oh wait
2016-11-11T21:29:15 <colinclark> I guess we can get names of ports, too, without creating new instances, right?
2016-11-11T21:29:20 <simonjb> yes
2016-11-11T21:29:32 <colinclark> so we can safely have the system have a modelized representation of all the ports we see
2016-11-11T21:29:42 <colinclark> and only create Port objects for those we actually want to open
2016-11-11T21:29:53 <colinclark> which will at least partially minimize our use of resources
2016-11-11T21:30:26 <colinclark> but I guess it\'s still a problematic situation to  not be able to release ports we close
2016-11-11T21:31:07 <simonjb> we could still potentially run into issues if there were enough ports opened
2016-11-11T21:31:22 <colinclark> Yeah... I mean, if I remember, the Flocking midi selector UI component immediately opens a port when it is selected in the dropdown
2016-11-11T21:31:26 <simonjb> but it would minimize our exposure to the issue
2016-11-11T21:31:29 <colinclark> and closed again if another is selected
2016-11-11T21:31:38 <colinclark> In practice, this isn\'t really an issue on Node.js
2016-11-11T21:31:51 <colinclark> and we can assume that the WebMIDI API is better behaved
2016-11-11T21:32:01 <simonjb> likely, yes
2016-11-11T21:32:11 <colinclark> but I do mention it as a possible case where we\'re frequently opening and closing ports
2016-11-11T21:32:40 <colinclark> maybe it\'s a bad UI, but I have appreciated being able to just select an item from a dropdown, start playing on my controller, and hearing sound
2016-11-11T21:33:01 <simonjb> it\'s a reasonable thing to do, I think
2016-11-11T21:35:02 <colinclark> I think it is reasonable to reduce our number of instantiations of midi instances by only creating them when we want to open a port
2016-11-11T21:35:42 <colinclark> and at very least it seems reasonable to suggest a fix to node-midi for giving us some way of controlling when an underlying rtmidi object is deallocated
2016-11-11T21:36:05 <colinclark> but none of this is ideal
2016-11-11T21:36:45 <colinclark> have  you used Infusion dynamic components before, simonjb?
2016-11-11T21:37:14 <simonjb> I will at least file an issue against node-midi and prepare some simple solution for illustration
2016-11-11T21:37:17 <colinclark> ok
2016-11-11T21:37:57 <simonjb> I don\'t believe that I\'ve used dynamic components
2016-11-11T21:38:23 <colinclark> I think we should be able to use them to only create Port instances when they are open
2016-11-11T21:38:35 <simonjb> oh, that\'s great
2016-11-11T21:38:39 <colinclark> presumably our ports model will contain a few things
2016-11-11T21:39:15 <colinclark> the "id" (in this case, just the port number\xe2\x80\x94web midi provides real IDs for each port), the "name", and perhaps an isOpen flag
2016-11-11T21:39:59 <colinclark> I\'d assume we can have a model listener on the latter field, and then fire an appropriate event that will cause a dynamic Port component to be created for this
2016-11-11T21:40:18 <simonjb> I\'m also wondering if this particular node-midi/RtMidi behaviour might be limited to ALSA or at least it seems likely that it would present in different ways on different platforms
2016-11-11T21:40:36 <colinclark> it\'s quite possible it could be an issue anywhere
2016-11-11T21:41:36 <simonjb> it could for sure, I would be interested sometime if you tried my crash test on Mac
2016-11-11T21:43:33 <colinclark> do i need multiple devices to plug in?
2016-11-11T21:43:39 <colinclark> I have my Quneo back at the hotel
2016-11-11T21:43:45 <simonjb> no, you don\'t need any midi devices at all
2016-11-11T21:43:54 <colinclark> oh great
2016-11-11T21:43:55 <simonjb> https://github.com/simonbates/nexus-experiments/blob/master/crashNodeMidi.js
2016-11-11T21:44:00 <colinclark> I\'ll try it now
2016-11-11T21:44:04 <simonjb> oh, awesome
2016-11-11T21:44:11 <colinclark> nice test :)
2016-11-11T21:46:49 <colinclark> the script should terminate when it has successfully allocated 100 midi input instances, right?
2016-11-11T21:47:33 <simonjb> it will probably not terminate
2016-11-11T21:47:45 <colinclark> ah, I guess node-midi is keeping it alive?
2016-11-11T21:48:08 <simonjb> https://github.com/justinlatimer/node-midi/issues/117
2016-11-11T21:48:10 <simonjb> :)
2016-11-11T21:48:24 <colinclark> oh yes
2016-11-11T21:49:09 <simonjb> you can add a process.exit();
2016-11-11T21:49:23 <colinclark> yeah
2016-11-11T21:49:31 <colinclark> I also tried with a loop that closes each port
2016-11-11T21:49:38 <colinclark> in all cases, it seems to work fine with CoreMIDI
2016-11-11T21:49:53 <simonjb> what if you up the number?
2016-11-11T21:49:55 <simonjb> 1000
2016-11-11T21:49:57 <simonjb> or 10000
2016-11-11T21:49:59 <colinclark> ooh, fun :)
2016-11-11T21:51:41 <colinclark> Takes a while, but CoreMIDI has no problem with a million midi input instances
2016-11-11T21:51:54 <simonjb> ok, that\'s good to know
2016-11-11T21:52:09 <colinclark> would you like me to try on Windows?
2016-11-11T21:52:21 <simonjb> oh sure, that would be great
2016-11-11T21:52:21 <colinclark> I have this hot Surface tablet here
2016-11-11T21:52:44 <simonjb> I wonder if that\'s maybe why it hasn\'t been a bigger issue
2016-11-11T21:53:05 <simonjb> that it doesn\'t cause problems on other platforms
2016-11-11T21:54:45 <colinclark> this beast is running Node 0.10.4!
2016-11-11T21:54:52 <simonjb> ah
2016-11-11T21:55:19 <simonjb> yes, I guess it was set up a while ago :)
2016-11-11T21:56:04 <colinclark> i\'ll just be a couple minutes to upgrade

2016-11-11T22:16:07 <colinclark> and then it seemed to just shutdown for some reason
2016-11-11T22:16:21 <colinclark> so I just fired up a GPII VM
2016-11-11T22:16:27 <colinclark> and I\'m way further along in a matter of seconds
2016-11-11T22:18:25 <colinclark> simonjb: Looks like Windows is also fine
2016-11-11T22:18:54 <colinclark> interestingly, rtmidi logs a warning about no devices being available

2016-11-11T22:20:55 <Bosmon> The Infusion component lifetime model is a little clunky, but effective
2016-11-11T22:20:55 <simonjb> thanks colinclark
2016-11-11T22:21:13 <Bosmon> Clunky, given the scheme for allocating things isn\'t quite symmetric with the means for deallocating them
2016-11-11T22:21:20 <Bosmon> But, at least these time points exist : P
2016-11-11T22:21:37 <Bosmon> I\'ve been exploring ways of improving this in the crude authoring work I gave you a demo of
2016-11-11T22:21:51 <Bosmon> But I came to the conclusion that there\'s not a lot that can be done before the big framework rewrite
2016-11-11T22:22:08 <colinclark> Did what I described seem reasonable, Bosmon?

2016-11-11T18:02:23 * alanharnum joined the channel
2016-11-11T18:06:22 <Bosmon> That\'s certainly some pretty crufty ancient stuff there
2016-11-11T18:06:28 <Bosmon> I\'d imagine it could just be deleted
2016-11-11T18:06:35 <colinclark> that\'s what I was thinking, too
2016-11-11T18:06:47 <colinclark> but it seems it definitely needs to be done in the gpii-app branch
2016-11-11T18:06:54 <colinclark> Bosmon: Do you know if sgithens has plans to make pull requests for several of his interesting-looking hacks in this new release?
2016-11-11T18:07:08 <colinclark> The one that changes localhost to 127.0.0.1 seems like a no-brainer, too
2016-11-11T18:07:12 <Bosmon> colinclark - I don\'t know if he does
2016-11-11T18:07:27 <Bosmon> colinclark - well, I talked over the localhsot one with him and suggested that this was best patched in Kettle
2016-11-11T18:07:40 <colinclark> ok
2016-11-11T18:07:48 <colinclark> so my sense is that we\'ve got an opportunity here
2016-11-11T18:07:58 <colinclark> to quickly fold in a number of fixes reflected in Steve\'s branch
2016-11-11T18:08:04 <colinclark> so we don\'t lose track of them
2016-11-11T18:08:23 <colinclark> I wonder if anyone in the channel has time to look through them and file some JIRAs as needed?
2016-11-11T18:08:31 <Bosmon> I\'ll file the localhost one
2016-11-11T18:09:08 <colinclark> cool
2016-11-11T18:19:41 <jhernandez> gloob: I merged your pull/100 locally, I\'ll push it after the provisioning process is finished ;)
2016-11-11T18:22:44 <jhernandez> colinclark: that\'s a good idea, but shouldn\'t be Steve the one describing such hacks somewhere? I guess that he\'s the one that understands every hack on LGS - at least this is what kasper and I did for the cloud4all review branches
2016-11-11T18:23:01 <colinclark> yes, he probably should
2016-11-11T18:23:13 <colinclark> I\'m just sensitive the the fact that he only works very part time with us right now
2016-11-11T18:23:24 <colinclark> and thinking these are the kinds of things that sometimes get lost in the shuffle
2016-11-11T18:23:39 <michelled1> colinclark: sorry, was getting lunch - no I don\'t know anything about that hack.
2016-11-11T18:24:24 <colinclark> I suspect part of the reason he made such a comprehensive README was so that we can do some forensics of his branch :)
2016-11-11T18:24:37 <jhernandez> colinclark: yeah, that\'s what I was about to say
2016-11-11T18:24:41 <colinclark> michelled1: Sounds like you should roll it into gpii-app, if only by simply removing that code
2016-11-11T18:25:05 <jhernandez> before that README I didn\'t know at all which branches he was using for LGS
2016-11-11T18:25:28 <colinclark> exactly
2016-11-11T18:25:35 <colinclark> I\'m relieved that it\'s so detailed

2016-11-11T20:32:00 <Bosmon> Hi simonjb
2016-11-11T20:32:16 * yzen_ is now known as yzen
2016-11-11T20:32:27 <simonjb> hi Bosmon
2016-11-11T20:32:53 * colinclark has quit
2016-11-11T20:33:31 <simonjb> I have a design problem that I wondered if you might have some advice on or some ideas of other projects with similar situations
2016-11-11T20:33:42 <Bosmon> aha
2016-11-11T20:34:27 <simonjb> In my MIDI monitoring work I have run into an interesting resource management problem in node-midi -- the node.js library for the C++ RtMidi
2016-11-11T20:35:07 <simonjb> I\'m thinking that it probably makes sense to address in node-midi but I\'m not quite sure of the best approach
2016-11-11T20:35:34 <simonjb> https://github.com/simonbates/nexus-experiments/blob/master/crashNodeMidi.js
2016-11-11T20:35:59 <simonjb> will crash on Linux ALSA with "ALSA lib seq_hw.c:457:(snd_seq_hw_open) open /dev/snd/seq failed: Cannot allocate memory"
2016-11-11T20:37:16 <simonjb> I\'m still tracing through the code but I believe that the root cause is that constructing an instance of midi.input() creates a corresponding RtMidiIn C++ object
2016-11-11T20:37:49 <simonjb> which allocates ALSA structures that are finite
2016-11-11T20:38:07 <simonjb> and when we have constructed enough, we run out
2016-11-11T20:38:50 <simonjb> the node-midi object destructor does free the underlying object but it is my understanding that there is no guarantee that V8 will ever call it
2016-11-11T20:39:13 <Bosmon> Such problems are very, very tough...
2016-11-11T20:39:24 <Bosmon> The modern "finite resource par excellence" is GPU memory...
2016-11-11T20:39:27 <simonjb> my initial fix has been to add an explicit "release()" method to free the underlying resources
2016-11-11T20:39:35 <Bosmon> And daily I can observe my machine conking out as various apps contend over it
2016-11-11T20:40:32 <simonjb> are there good patterns that you\'ve seen or use to manage resources in javascript, where we cannot rely on gc?
2016-11-11T20:40:35 <Bosmon> At least infusion has "eager" rather than lazy destruction semantics
2016-11-11T20:40:45 <Bosmon> But this doesn\'t necessarily help if you don\'t have a resource usage model
2016-11-11T20:40:48 <gloob> cindyli: it gives ANY error?
2016-11-11T20:41:01 <Bosmon> I can imagine a world where there is a kind of "hibernation queue"
2016-11-11T20:41:14 <cindyli> yes, gloob, i pasted the error above
2016-11-11T20:41:22 <Bosmon> Some of the techniques I allude to in the PPIG paper suggest such a world could arise

2016-11-11T20:41:36 <gloob> below is nothing
2016-11-11T20:41:42 <Bosmon> If any "in-memory state" is equivalent to "serialised state" then in theory you could serialise any application segment without warning
2016-11-11T20:41:52 <Bosmon> If you\'ve determined that you need it to loose its hold on some vital system resource
2016-11-11T20:42:01 <Bosmon> I guess Android apps work a little like this
2016-11-11T20:42:38 <Bosmon> I may be misunderstanding your angle on the problem
2016-11-11T20:42:57 <Bosmon> In that you may just be interested in how we can deallocate anything at all
2016-11-11T20:43:12 <Bosmon> BUt I guess there is some particular reason that the previous RtMidiIn objects might be considered "In use"
2016-11-11T20:43:31 <Bosmon> At least if they mapped one-to-one to Infusion components, you could be sure about where each one is
2016-11-11T20:43:48 <Bosmon> And then explicitly call "destroy" on ones that one intended to be defunct
2016-11-11T20:43:55 <Bosmon> But perhaps I\'m still just "talking around the issue"
2016-11-11T20:44:18 <simonjb> I think the fix needs to be in node-midi, and this isn\'t an infusion situation
2016-11-11T20:44:21 <Bosmon> So i) why might there be previous instances of this object in memory, and ii) to what extent could you be sure that you don\'t want them?
2016-11-11T20:44:58 <Bosmon> Well, it isn\'t an infusion situation NOW : P

2016-11-11T16:47:13 <cindyli> There was an error while downloading the metadata for this box.
2016-11-11T16:47:14 <amatas> I\'m triying to shrink the box anyway
2016-11-11T16:47:14 <cindyli> The error message is shown below:
2016-11-11T16:47:26 <michelled1> teresa_: what would you like to use Infusion for?
2016-11-11T16:47:32 * alanharnum joined the channel
2016-11-11T16:48:00 <cindyli> the error message shows 2 empty lines - nothing
2016-11-11T16:48:01 <amatas> cindyli, It seems that you need to upgrade Virtualbox first
2016-11-11T16:48:22 <cindyli> i\'ve upgraded it to 5.0.28
2016-11-11T16:49:22 <cindyli> amatas: might because i was at a lower vbox version when I fetched the win box. and after the upgrade, a refetch throws an error?
2016-11-11T16:49:25 * teresa_ has quit
2016-11-11T16:49:42 <cindyli> an unknown error tho
2016-11-11T16:50:07 <amatas> "There was an error while downloading the metadata for this box." maybe a network error
2016-11-11T16:50:31 <cindyli> just ran again and same
2016-11-11T16:50:35 <amatas> do you get the same error if you run the same command again ?
2016-11-11T16:50:43 <amatas> agh
2016-11-11T16:51:10 <gloob> vagrant box remove current
2016-11-11T16:51:11 <cindyli> amatas: shall i completely remove this vm from my disk and re-run "vagrant up" to refetch from the scratch?
2016-11-11T16:51:12 <gloob> vagrant up
2016-11-11T16:51:15 <gloob> yes
2016-11-11T16:51:17 <cindyli> cool
2016-11-11T16:51:38 <gloob> meanwhile Im checking this error
2016-11-11T16:51:48 <cindyli> amatas: The box you requested to be removed could not be found. No
2016-11-11T16:51:48 <cindyli> boxes named \'current\' could be found.

2016-11-11T16:52:20 <amatas> vagrant box remove inclusivedesign/windows10-eval
2016-11-11T16:53:49 <gloob> vagrant destroy, you mean?
2016-11-11T16:54:04 <gloob> yes, by current I mean the windows10-eval
2016-11-11T16:54:07 <amatas> gloob, sorry, yes I meant vagrant destroy
2016-11-11T16:54:23 <gloob> $ vagrant destroy && vagrant box remove inclusivedesign/windows10-eval
2016-11-11T16:54:46 <gloob> so launching new vagrant up, let\'s see that original typo
2016-11-11T16:54:52 <gloob> NOT MY FAULT! :D
2016-11-11T16:54:59 <amatas> I\'ve cloned the GPII windows repo and run vagrant up, I see the "-e" option error, but the provision concludes fine
2016-11-11T16:55:17 <gloob> I will check it in the windows shell
2016-11-11T16:55:22 <cindyli> amatas: did that, box removed, "vagrant up" throws this - http://pastebin.com/VTK069Zp
2016-11-11T16:55:47 <gloob> probably is a MILLENIUM typo
2016-11-11T16:56:45 <cindyli> have run "vagrant up" multiple time, same error.
2016-11-11T16:56:48 <gloob> vagrant init inclusivedesign/windows10-eval; vagrant up --provider virtualbox
2016-11-11T16:56:56 <gloob> let is see that way
2016-11-11T16:58:00 <cindyli> running "vagrant init inclusivedesign/windows10-eval" says: `Vagrantfile` already exists in this directory. Remove it before
2016-11-11T16:58:00 <cindyli> running `vagrant init`.
2016-11-11T16:58:07 <amatas> cindyli, I don\'t know why you can\'t download or fetch information of the vagrant windows vm from hashicorp
2016-11-11T16:58:20 <cindyli> but if i run "vagrant box remove inclusivedesign/windows10-eval", it says: The box you requested to be removed could not be found. No
2016-11-11T16:58:20 <cindyli> boxes named \'inclusivedesign/windows10-eval\' could be found.
2016-11-11T16:58:20 <cindyli> c
2016-11-11T16:58:33 <cindyli> amatas: last time was ok tho
2016-11-11T16:58:52 <gloob> oh yes, right, my fault, dont do that :D
2016-11-11T16:59:02 <amatas> yes, in fact I\'m downloading the box right now
2016-11-11T16:59:06 <gloob> amatas: how is to download it?
2016-11-11T16:59:12 <gloob> vagrant box waht
2016-11-11T16:59:14 <gloob> what?
2016-11-11T16:59:17 <jhernandez> vagrant box add
2016-11-11T16:59:19 <amatas> the command vagrant up should download it
2016-11-11T16:59:23 <jhernandez> yup
2016-11-11T16:59:26 <gloob> vagrant box add
2016-11-11T16:59:37 <gloob> vagrant box add inclusivedesign/windows10-eval
2016-11-11T16:59:38 <amatas> if it\'s not found in your system
2016-11-11T16:59:52 <cindyli> so, i should run "vagrant box add inclusivedesign/windows10-eval"?
2016-11-11T16:59:56 <gloob> yes
2016-11-11T16:59:58 <gloob> let is see

b'2016-11-11T15:20:16 * kavya joined the channel
2016-11-11T15:22:52 <amatas> nothing official, I think that some members of the ops team are using the latest version (as me) while try to run the tests without issues
2016-11-11T15:24:11 <gloob> is it working?
2016-11-11T15:26:31 <amatas> it is, at least it works well with my daily vm tasks
2016-11-11T15:26:51 <Bosmon2> gloob - "80% of the time should be pretty similar" is nice, but not entirely helpful for new developers who want to get their own VM right :)
2016-11-11T15:27:47 <Bosmon2> cindyli, alanharnum - I\'ve filed https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/KETTLE-49 about the DataSource pileup
2016-11-11T15:28:16 <alanharnum> thanks Bosmon2
2016-11-11T15:29:37 <cindyli> good explanation. thanks, Bosmon2
2016-11-11T15:30:00 <alanharnum> would this proposal basically entail that an end user of a concrete datasource grade would simply use "foo.dataSource" for a read-only grade, and "foo.dataSource.writable" for a read+write grade?
2016-11-11T15:30:20 <gloob> Bosmon2: we cannot change context conditions
2016-11-11T15:30:36 <alanharnum> rather than setting the "writable" boolean + each concrete grade needing to specify readOnlyGrade?
2016-11-11T15:30:59 <Bosmon2> alanharnum - well, this proposal essentially allows people to make their own choices - what you describe is currently the status quo, with hard-coded names derived from the rule in that code snippet
2016-11-11T15:31:10 <Bosmon2> Although I imagine we\'d prefer that people carried on with the current naming
2016-11-11T15:31:13 <gloob> but I\'m sure that if somebody have an idea to overcome that 20% gap the ops team would be please to hear :D
2016-11-11T15:31:16 <gloob> pleased*
2016-11-11T15:31:47 <Bosmon2> gloob - well, I hope we don\'t need a miraculous idea to come from the outside to encourage the ops team to modularise their scripts :)
2016-11-11T15:32:09 <Bosmon2> I think this discussion makes it clear that it\'s still impossible for even an experienced user coming to the project to make our stuff work
2016-11-11T15:32:18 <gloob> umhhhh
2016-11-11T15:32:22 <gloob> it is just vagrant up
2016-11-11T15:32:32 <gloob> the main problem is current exposed information I guess
2016-11-11T15:32:42 <Bosmon2> Yes - and what if someone wants a VM choice for which we have not written a vagrant configuration?
2016-11-11T15:32:53 <Bosmon2> For example, we need to test under Windows 8.1 now
2016-11-11T15:32:56 <gloob> that\'s another question and we have an issue for that
2016-11-11T15:33:08 <amatas> https://github.com/GPII/windows#test-vm
2016-11-11T15:33:09 <Bosmon2> Well sure, we have an issue - but how can we help cindyli and me today?
2016-11-11T15:33:23 <gloob> do you need to test against windows 8.1?
2016-11-11T15:33:25 <gloob> why?
2016-11-11T15:33:32 <gloob> current scope for APCP is windows 10
2016-11-11T15:33:45 <gloob> I mean, we need it, for sure
2016-11-11T15:34:05 <amatas> it\'s a good starting point. But of course, I\'m happy to receive any developer experience in order to enhance the testing experience.
2016-11-11T15:34:15 <gloob> I, personally was using a windows 8.1 vagrant box and launching the provisiongin scripts, but I admit is hard to maintain
2016-11-11T15:34:58 <gloob> this needs love https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-1762, yes
2016-11-11T15:35:49 <gloob> Bosmon2: do you need a windows 8.1 image for gpii? I think we can create an image
2016-11-11T15:36:06 <gloob> as far as I know javi was using one for testing
2016-11-11T15:36:34 <gloob> probably he can export it and share so you can save the hurdle of setting up everything
2016-11-11T15:38:30 <gloob> it will help? Bosmon2 cindyli?
2016-11-11T15:39:35 <gloob> "we have an issue for that" is a great motto for us
2016-11-11T15:39:36 <gloob> :D
2016-11-11T15:40:03 <cindyli> gloob: i just happen to have a pre-installed window 8 and think it\'s a fresh vm to set up GPII. considering the time i spent yesterday doing that, i\'m very happy to have an existing provisionable windows vm to test with. but it certainly would be great if we have clear instructions on how to get things set up yourself.
2016-11-11T15:40:44 <cindyli> i saw steven\'s email to the list about the double-clickable installer
2016-11-11T15:41:25 <cindyli> hopefully it will become easier and easier to do it in the future
2016-11-11T15:42:11 <cindyli> but i guess setting up a dev environment in different platforms would be a bit tricky
2016-11-11T15:42:37 <amatas> cindyli, here you have the instructions to set up a fresh windows 10 vm for testing: https://github.com/GPII/windows#test-vm
2016-11-11T15:43:05 <gloob> cindyli: well, execution != building
2016-11-11T15:43:07 <amatas> and here they are the requirements: https://github.com/GPII/qi-development-environments/#requirements , may be a bit outdated
2016-11-11T15:43:38 <cindyli> right, dev !== production
2016-11-11T15:43:40 <gloob> cindyli: do you know where I can find that automatic tool?
2016-11-11T15:44:08 <gloob> cindyli: I reviewed Steve\'s mail and I don\'t understand exactly how you can build with a double click a demo package yet
2016-11-11T15:44:17 <gloob> cindyli: although for APCP is ACE
2016-11-11T15:44:19 <cindyli> gloob: steve gives a link to his repo - https://github.com/GPII/gpii-packages/releases/tag/GPII_Demo_2016-11-05 but not sure where to find the executable
2016-11-11T15:44:37 <gloob> for creating the environment in a fresh windows installation I recommend
2016-11-11T15:44:57 <gloob> 1) follow the recipe in irdc devops group, I need to look for it
2016-11-11T15:45:12 <gloob> 2) execute the scripts defined in the vagrantfile in the same order
2016-11-11T15:45:13 <Bosmon2> gloob - all of us need 8.1 boxes, since 8.1 is definitely within scope for APCP
2016-11-11T15:45:19 <Bosmon2> I think there seems to be a bit of a misunderstanding here
2016-11-11T15:45:31 <Bosmon2> Since stegru is currently servicing JIRAs raised by kavya against Windows 8.1
2016-11-11T15:45:51 <Bosmon2> Therefore this is part of our top-level support
2016-11-11T15:46:21 * Bosmon2 is now known as Bosmon
2016-11-11T15:47:38 <gloob> Bosmon: yes, that was my understanding one month ago and we tried to create a "squad group" to create as much vm we can but the focus drive to update existing ones
2016-11-11T15:48:11 <Bosmon> Ok - if we don\'t have resources for the squad group, we should at least try to maintain an up-to-date list of human readable instructions
2016-11-11T15:48:37 <Bosmon> Or help people to understand what scripts are run within vagrant that they can then reverse-engineer
2016-11-11T15:49:40 <kavya> APCP core 1 testing is mainly focused on windows 10,but windows 8 and windows 8.1 are in the scope as well
2016-11-11T15:49:46 <gloob> Bosmon: I agree, with second part, I think we need more information about how the vm internals creation work, in fact is somehow easy to explain (although not to maintain)
2016-11-11T15:49:51 <kavya> it is good to have windows 7
2016-11-11T15:50:00 <amatas> I\'m somewhat confuse, in the very latest meeting I\'ve attended it said that the firest APCP pilots will only run windows 10
2016-11-11T15:50:03 <gloob> it is all here https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-1762
2016-11-11T15:50:09 <gloob> the order is the priority
2016-11-11T15:50:22 <Bosmon> ok
2016-11-11T15:50:26 <gloob> well, maybe we can drop to the bottom the 32 bits version
2016-11-11T15:50:37 <gloob> I\'m going to do that
2016-11-11T15:50:45 <gloob> are you all ok with that?
2016-11-11T15:50:54 <Bosmon> Sure
2016-11-11T15:51:07 <Bosmon> Well, the priority is for us to economise our development effort - and right now, there are at least 3 of us who have had to make Windows 8.1 boxes by ourselves
2016-11-11T15:51:20 <Bosmon> stegru, cindyli, kavya and me
2016-11-11T15:51:57 <gloob> well, we all create one! :D
2016-11-11T15:52:45 <Bosmon> gloob - so - your new provisioning scripts like https://github.com/GPII/windows/blob/master/provisioning/Provisioning.psm1
2016-11-11T15:52:54 <Bosmon> Do these make sense to execute outside the context of vagrant?
2016-11-11T15:53:14 * michelled joined the channel
2016-11-11T15:54:04 <gloob> yes
2016-11-11T15:54:07 <jhernandez> Bosmon: put me on that win81 list, I have a Vagrantfile for it and used a pretty simple image of win81 that alfredo shared with me
2016-11-11T15:54:14 <gloob> but you need to follow the vagrantfile order
2016-11-11T15:54:29 <gloob> https://github.com/GPII/windows/blob/master/Vagrantfile#L43
2016-11-11T15:54:36 <gloob> In fact
2016-11-11T15:54:39 <gloob> when creating that
2016-11-11T15:54:58 <gloob> I was thinking that it doesn\'t make sense to have in separate scripts and create a big new one that you just launch
2016-11-11T15:55:01 <gloob> BUT
2016-11-11T15:55:07 <gloob> before launching this scripts you need to:
2016-11-11T15:55:19 <gloob> 1) launch the provisioning of the vm scripts that are located
2016-11-11T15:55:23 <Bosmon> ok
2016-11-11T15:55:43 <gloob> https://github.com/idi-ops/packer-windows/blob/master/windows_10.json#L21
2016-11-11T15:55:43 <gloob> here
2016-11-11T15:55:50 <Bosmon> Is this line here everything that is responsible for installing the ms build tools? https://github.com/GPII/windows/blob/master/provisioning/Chocolatey.ps1#L35
2016-11-11T15:55:51 <gloob> it\'s a two steps process

2016-11-11T15:56:43 <kavya> amatas:My understanding is..Yes,APCP pilots will run on windows 10 so it is top priority and testing is done in windows 8 and 8.1 as well to support Hardware sensitivity testing
2016-11-11T15:57:00 <gloob> yes, I think we all agree that we need them
2016-11-11T15:59:31 <jhernandez> then I guess that from this conversation (I haven\'t read all of it) there are 2 things: 1) we must update our build instructions (nuke the instructions on the wiki page and make sure that instructions live in each repo\'s README) and 2) create vagrant boxes for win81 and win8 for developers that want to have a dev environment easily
2016-11-11T15:59:35 <jhernandez> is that correct?
2016-11-11T15:59:49 <Bosmon> jhernandez - yes
2016-11-11T16:00:10 <gloob> and 3) create a document explaining the vm build and provisioning process
2016-11-11T16:00:22 <Bosmon> I hacked at the build instructions a little, just to remove obviously incorrect stuff and add a warning note that they are out of date
2016-11-11T16:00:23 <gloob> jhernandez: I think it is worth to create an issue with that
2016-11-11T16:01:02 <Bosmon> But unfortunately I\'m unable to explain how to create a new machine either
2016-11-11T16:01:14 <gloob> 2) is linked with https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-1762
2016-11-11T16:01:23 <gloob> I can get 3
2016-11-11T16:01:34 <Bosmon> I posted to the arch list a few months ago with some of my discoveries about how to install less stuff, and gtirloni responded saying "Yes, we know all that, that\'s what we do in vagrant now"
2016-11-11T16:01:44 <gloob> hehe
2016-11-11T16:01:51 <gloob> do you have a link?
2016-11-11T16:01:54 <Bosmon> But unfortunately this information has still not disseminated in a way that "an average dev" can use
2016-11-11T16:01:55 <gloob> I remember the initial mail
2016-11-11T16:02:35 <jhernandez> Bosmon, gloob: okay, I\'ll JIRA the "update build instructions" thing
2016-11-11T16:02:53 <gloob> jhernandez: I will create 3rd item then
2016-11-11T16:02:58 <gloob> GOOD
2016-11-11T16:03:01 <gloob> time for lunch
2016-11-11T16:03:24 * stegru has quit
2016-11-11T16:03:32 <Bosmon> gloob - here it is: http://lists.gpii.net/pipermail/architecture/2016-July/004224.html
2016-11-11T16:04:56 <gloob> Bosmon: ah I see, yes, I don\'t know if that could collide with the needed tools for the installer creation, a worth to check probably
2016-11-11T16:07:58 * alanharnum has quit
2016-11-11T16:11:46 <Bosmon> Well, all I can say is, it\'s magnificent that we have this channel here where we can all get together
2016-11-11T16:12:13 * alanharnum joined the channel
2016-11-11T16:18:19 <amatas> Bosmon, gloob : here you have the scripts that the builder run inside the windows 10 vagrant box https://github.com/idi-ops/packer-windows/tree/master/scripts , the order of execution is here: https://github.com/idi-ops/packer-windows/blob/master/windows_10.json#L65-L68

2016-11-11T16:29:02 <cindyli> gloob, amatas, jhernandez, running "vagrant up" within gpii/windows repo on my mac os 10.11.6 ended up with this error: http://pastebin.com/TW0w5wnp
2016-11-11T16:30:04 <cindyli> before and after i upgraded to vagrant 1.8.7 and vbox 5.0.28
2016-11-11T16:30:53 <cindyli> after the upgrade, i ran "vagrant destroy -f" then "vagrant up" to make sure the re-provisioning will happen
2016-11-11T16:30:56 <jhernandez> cindyli: weird, looks like chocolatey couldn\'t find node\'s 6.9.1 version
2016-11-11T16:31:02 * alanharn_ has quit
2016-11-11T16:31:12 <cindyli> jhernandez: anything i could do at my end?
2016-11-11T16:31:55 <gloob> cindyli: let me check
2016-11-11T16:32:31 <amatas> gloob, it seems that there is a typo, --version instead "-version"
2016-11-11T16:32:48 <amatas> https://github.com/GPII/windows/blob/master/provisioning/Chocolatey.ps1#L10
2016-11-11T16:33:01 <gloob> seems so, yes
2016-11-11T16:33:01 <Bosmon> Well, that\'s funny
2016-11-11T16:33:08 <Bosmon> How come this typo has not resulted in a failure before?
2016-11-11T16:33:10 <jhernandez> mm, not sure, I would start over again - actually it\'s working here VirtualBox 5.0.18_SUSE r106667 and vagrant 1.8.1
2016-11-11T16:33:12 <gloob> and why is happening to her?
2016-11-11T16:33:14 <jhernandez> Bosmon: exactly
2016-11-11T16:33:20 <gloob> and why it was not happening
2016-11-11T16:33:20 <amatas> Bosmon very good question
2016-11-11T16:33:35 <gloob> cindyli: is it a custom virtualbox?

2016-11-11T14:04:46 <Bosmon2> cindyli - so your latest commit to https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/464 is very peculiar
2016-11-11T14:05:14 <Bosmon2> Since if the grade linkage record is not required, this suggests that the entirety of the grade gpii.dataSource.pouchDB.writable is also not required
2016-11-11T14:09:27 <Bosmon2> Urgh
2016-11-11T14:09:29 <Bosmon2> I see it all now :(
2016-11-11T14:09:55 <Bosmon2> dataSource has two completely parallel systems for mixin grades and "core grades"
2016-11-11T14:24:27 <cindyli> Bosmon2: i now have a better understanding on the route using writable and readOnlyGrade options which trigger getWritableGrade(), but still not quite sure when/how the grade linkage kicks in
2016-11-11T14:26:34 * alanharnum joined the channel
2016-11-11T14:31:42 <cindyli> Bosmon2, Bosmon5, is our windows installation instruction for GPII is up to date - https://wiki.gpii.net/w/Setting_Up_Your_Development_Environment#Windows_Installation_Instructions? one thing that\'s no longer valid is the build step: grunt build, the Gruntfile.js in the windows repo no longer has "build" step defined
2016-11-11T14:34:03 <cindyli> anyway, i followed all other instructions to set up my windows 8 VM. running AcceptanceTests.js with the master branch throws this error:
2016-11-11T14:35:19 <cindyli> fatal error: uncaught exception: could not locate bindings files, tried:
2016-11-11T14:35:40 <cindyli> C:\\gpii\\windows\
ode_modules\\ref\\build\\bindings.node
2016-11-11T14:35:41 <cindyli> ..
2016-11-11T14:35:49 <cindyli> does this error look familiar to you?
2016-11-11T14:39:56 <Bosmon2> cindyli - yes
2016-11-11T14:40:18 <Bosmon2> That is what happens when you run npm install on the outside of the VM rather than the inside
2016-11-11T14:40:35 <Bosmon2> Oh sorry, I see vagrant isn\'t involved here
2016-11-11T14:41:10 <Bosmon2> These instructions are horrifically out of date
2016-11-11T14:41:25 <cindyli> ya, no vagrant. i didn\'t run npm install, i ran "npm install --ignore-scripts=true" on the instruction
2016-11-11T14:41:34 <cindyli> ah ok
2016-11-11T14:41:34 <Bosmon2> No, one never does that any more
2016-11-11T14:41:46 <cindyli> :\'(
2016-11-11T14:45:31 <cindyli> Bosmon2: what\'s the correct steps? only to run "npm install"? do python and VisualStudio need to be installed? i\'ve got them installed. hope i don\'t need to uninstall them
2016-11-11T14:48:40 * michelled has quit
2016-11-11T14:48:45 <Bosmon2> cindyli - I\'ve tried to update the instructions a little
2016-11-11T14:48:50 <Bosmon2> WIth my best understanding of what is involved
2016-11-11T14:49:03 <Bosmon2> And also added a warning that these instructions are unmaintained and not to be depended on
2016-11-11T14:49:03 <cindyli> thanks, Bosmon2. looking at it now
2016-11-11T14:49:36 <Bosmon2> To be honest, I suspect that only someone like gtirloni or amatas really understands what the correct instructions are, since they rely on being able to understand the contents of the vagrant provisioning files
2016-11-11T14:49:45 <Bosmon2> Yes, Python 2.x and Visual Studio must absolutely be installed
2016-11-11T14:49:59 <Bosmon2> And yes, simply "npm install" should be sufficient to build the GPII itself
2016-11-11T14:49:59 <cindyli> ok. good to know
2016-11-11T14:50:18 <Bosmon2> There are various other things that the Vagrant provisioning scripts do in order to build other things, like the user listeners
2016-11-11T14:50:25 <Bosmon2> I don\'t understand how they work
2016-11-11T14:50:41 <Bosmon2> I guess we should have a topic session at the next arch meeting about this
2016-11-11T14:50:43 <cindyli> running "npm install" on my VM fails at the step of "node-gyp rebuild"
2016-11-11T14:51:19 <cindyli> it complains: the windows SDK version 8.1 was not found
2016-11-11T14:51:35 <cindyli> but the directory for SDK 8.1 IS there
2016-11-11T14:52:49 <cindyli> ya, would be great to have this discussed. it\'s quite time consuming to figure out what cause these different errors
2016-11-11T14:53:10 <cindyli> will keep digging
2016-11-11T14:56:31 * simonjb joined the channel
2016-11-11T14:59:29 <jhernandez> cindyli: as Bosmon2 said, the instructions on the wiki are not correct so I would definitely follow the provisioning steps
2016-11-11T15:00:26 <jhernandez> re "it complains: the windows SDK version 8.1 was not found but the directory for SDK 8.1 IS there" I guess that probably you need to update the paths in the system as the provisioning scripts do, have you tried it?
2016-11-11T15:01:30 <cindyli> not yet, but will try, need to re-find where that path is
2016-11-11T15:02:41 <cindyli> jhernandez: where are the provisioning steps? can i find it in some vagrant related repo? i\'m setting up a pre-installed VM without using vagrant
2016-11-11T15:03:07 <cindyli> oh, probably there is a windows vagrant file i can download?
2016-11-11T15:03:14 <jhernandez> https://github.com/GPII/windows/blob/master/Vagrantfile
2016-11-11T15:03:24 <jhernandez> there you\'ll find the provisioning process
2016-11-11T15:03:50 <jhernandez> all the provisoning scripts live at https://github.com/GPII/windows/tree/master/provisioning
2016-11-11T15:04:23 <cindyli> thanks, jhernandez, so if i use "vagrant up" in the windows repo, the VM will be downloaded and provisioned
2016-11-11T15:04:37 <cindyli> trying..
2016-11-11T15:05:23 <jhernandez> cindyli: exactly
2016-11-11T15:05:47 <cindyli> thanks, jhernandez
2016-11-11T15:07:54 <gloob> cindyli: with vagrant up you mimick the same process that is happening in jenkins for every new commit into a new PR
2016-11-11T15:08:01 <Justin_o> cindyli: i\'ve updated my PR https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/783, it\'s ready for more review when you have a chance
2016-11-11T15:08:13 <gloob> so, if it works in the Jenkins it should work in your vagrant installation
2016-11-11T15:08:14 <gloob> BUT
2016-11-11T15:08:39 <gloob> there\'s some side things to take into account, because vagrant configuration is not the same in jenkins than in the developer machine
2016-11-11T15:08:53 * amatas joined the channel
2016-11-11T15:09:04 <gloob> BUT 80% of the time should be pretty similar
2016-11-11T15:09:24 <cindyli> what are those? does the OS used by the host machine matter? I have mac os
2016-11-11T15:09:58 <gloob> well, it is matter but not so much
2016-11-11T15:10:05 <gloob> currently vagrant and virtualbox versions are key
2016-11-11T15:10:11 <gloob> you should have installed the recommended ones
2016-11-11T15:10:51 <cindyli> where can i find the recommended ones, gloob?
2016-11-11T15:10:54 <gloob> the differences between jenkins and the developer setup is based on jenkins "things" like headless and that kind of things
2016-11-11T15:10:59 <cindyli> sure, Justin_o, will have a look soon
2016-11-11T15:11:03 <gloob> cindyli: that\'s a good question, should be in the readme
2016-11-11T15:11:07 <cindyli> ok
2016-11-11T15:11:17 <gloob> if not, it should be a good PR

2016-11-11T15:15:18 <amatas> vbox 5.0.28 and vagrant 1.8.7 should be fine
2016-11-11T15:15:30 <cindyli> cool. thanks, gloob. my vbox is 5.0.14. needs an upgrade. i\'ve already spinned up the windows vagrant. will try it first before the upgrade

2016-11-11T15:15:51 <gloob> Vagrant 1.8.6
2016-11-11T15:15:59 <gloob> vagrant could be last version, yes
2016-11-11T15:16:05 <cindyli> thanks
2016-11-11T15:16:13 <gloob> we have problems with vbox 5.1 branch
2016-11-11T15:16:25 <gloob> np
2016-11-11T15:16:42 <amatas> anyway it seems that vbox 5.1 has fixed some bug that affected us, so we are checking if 5.1 is enough stable to be used by everybody
2016-11-11T15:17:05 <gloob> is that reported somewhere?
2016-11-11T15:17:10 <gloob> the progress I mean
2016-11-11T15:17:33 <amatas> the progress of what?, virtualbox 5.1 branch?

2016-11-11T15:18:50 <amatas> https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Changelog here you can find the most important changes
