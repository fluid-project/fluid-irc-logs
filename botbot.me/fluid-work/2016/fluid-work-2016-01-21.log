I've also been reading https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/documentation/PreferencesServer.md. Do you have any suggestions on what other material I sh

2016-01-21T21:10:25 <cindyli> simonjb: could you help to take a look at the new documentation for the authorization service API - https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/GPII-1546/documentation/AuthorizationService.md
2016-01-21T21:11:26 <cindyli> Bosmon, simonjb, do you have some time tomorrow to talk about this issue: https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-1521
2016-01-21T21:12:02 <cindyli> my questions so far:
2016-01-21T21:12:04 <cindyli> 1. what new kettle features I can use to improve the data store
2016-01-21T21:12:39 <cindyli> 2. where exactly the /add-preferences end point should be moved to? flow manager or preferences server
2016-01-21T21:13:40 <cindyli> that's it
2016-01-21T21:14:02 <cindyli> of course, there might be many details involved to answer those questions
