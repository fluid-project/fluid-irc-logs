2016-05-18T17:35:34 <colinclark> Bosmon: Can you explain to me the rationale for the way you've factored the new fluid.getCallerInfo()?
2016-05-18T17:35:59 <colinclark> I guess since it's in the module file, it's intended to only ever be used in Node.js, is that correct?
2016-05-18T17:37:53 <jhung> Justin_o: I've updated my gh-pages branch for the HTML sim. I've fixed the alert, status, and scene descriptions.
2016-05-18T17:38:01 <colinclark> and the empty catch/finally is there simply because we're having to monkey patch Error's prototype directly, and so it's crucial, regardless of errors, to restore the original prepareStackTrace implementation?

2016-05-18T14:21:06 <Justin_o> gtirloni: when will you be doing that?
2016-05-18T14:21:43 <gtirloni> in 10min, but i can reschedule np

2016-05-18T14:45:05 * lliskovoi has quit
2016-05-18T14:45:18 <jhernandez> in the same way our integration tests are broken - they fail in the first run if the orca settings file doesn\'t exxist

2016-05-18T14:50:19 <avtar> i was wondering if you or joseph uncovered any issues related to fedora 23 and gpii/linux
2016-05-18T14:50:40 <avtar> more specifically, the idi fedora 23 vagrant box
2016-05-18T14:52:51 <jhernandez> avtar: nothing that I\'m aware of
2016-05-18T14:54:30 <jhernandez> honestly, I only did a smoke test of it - in fact, today I was going to test everything again now that the linux pull has been merged into antranig\'s giant branch
2016-05-18T14:54:55 <jhernandez> I\'ll let you know, but everything seems to be ok
2016-05-18T14:55:05 <avtar> that would be awesome
2016-05-18T14:55:07 <avtar> thanks!

2016-05-18T17:04:46 <lliskovoi> Hi everyone! I\'m looking for someone who has experience with accessibility on Windows phones, specifically when it comes to third party applications (ideally someone who has experience in either development or testing). Does anyone have any leads?
2016-05-18T17:09:34 <Bosmon> Ok kasparnet I found something I can blame you for :)
2016-05-18T17:09:35 <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/commit/9a87a98be6f5c2f680696b50b3cc9e4d6482cfe7#diff-b850758894970110e0af05626affc2e7L373
2016-05-18T17:11:06 <kasparnet> Bosmon: damn
2016-05-18T17:11:27 <Bosmon> Ok I now have all the tests passing!
2016-05-18T17:11:29 <kasparnet> I\'m quite sure I did that change for a good reason
2016-05-18T17:11:33 <Bosmon> But we\'ve got a lot of cleanup to do
2016-05-18T17:11:37 <kasparnet> but not sure what that reason was :)
2016-05-18T17:12:12 <Bosmon> So i) I have screwed up our semantics for inputPath/outputPath being empty counting as "", and ii) you have screwed up our ability for this transform to output an escaped EL path as a value
2016-05-18T17:12:39 * jhernandez has quit
2016-05-18T17:12:39 <Bosmon> Between these these have made a mess of all of our transforms in the solutionsRegistry that use fluid.transforms.arrayToSetMembership and its inverse
