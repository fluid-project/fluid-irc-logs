2016-12-22T12:08:20 <amatas> gtirloni, I working on the GPII wiki upgrade, the thing is that the latest version of Mediawiki requires PHP 5.5 and CentOS only supports 5.4. I searched some possible options and this is the most reliable I found: https://webtatic.com/projects/yum-repository/
2016-12-22T12:09:07 <amatas> Have you ever used any of those repositories?, do you have any concern about using that to build a new (tagged) php-docker container with the latest version of PHP?
2016-12-22T12:10:07 <amatas> and sorry for not attending the arch meeting of yesterday, I didn't reach home on time to join.
2016-12-22T12:37:14 <gtirloni> amatas, hi! i think the centos software collections might offer a newer php version. i don't have any concerns with using a newer php in a container
2016-12-22T12:37:21 <gtirloni> i have never used the webtatic repo
2016-12-22T12:37:47 <gtirloni> for example: https://www.softwarecollections.org/en/scls/rhscl/rh-php56/
2016-12-22T12:44:32 <gtirloni> amatas, just sent you an email from april when i was researching this topic
2016-12-22T12:46:51 <amatas> thanks
2016-12-22T12:55:06 <gtirloni> i have to run an errand, i'll be back in one hour

2016-12-22T14:36:35 <cindyli> Bosmon: there isn't a good time for everyone to meet before Christmas on GPII security. I created a new doodle to find a time early January. Can you fill it up when you have a chance - http://doodle.com/poll/g5zsg9q2mbvwf2ny? thanks
