2016-06-13T14:48:24 <alanharnum> Bosmon cindyli colinclark: how we feel about merging https://github.com/fluid-project/chartAuthoring/pull/14? I'd love to close my open loop on it.
2016-06-13T14:48:50 <colinclark> Understandably, alanharnum
2016-06-13T14:49:09 <colinclark> I think I need to defer to either cindyli or Bosmon, since I just don't have the history with it, much as I wish I did
2016-06-13T14:49:24 <colinclark> Bosmon is probably still recovering from his travels
2016-06-13T14:49:28 <alanharnum> yes i'm just tagging everyone who's commented on the PR :)
2016-06-13T14:49:35 <colinclark> having only arrived back in the UK this morning
2016-06-13T14:49:45 <alanharnum> only the mildest of bumps, i understand people are still in travel recovery
2016-06-13T14:50:38 <colinclark> I will try to work on some improvements to Flocking that will ultimately help with the Chart Authoring tool
2016-06-13T14:53:12 <cindyli> alanharnum: i will have a look soon.
2016-06-13T14:55:45 <alanharnum> thanks cindyli
