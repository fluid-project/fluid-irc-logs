2016-01-07T18:38:13 <michelled> about different things
2016-01-07T18:38:20 <michelled> maybe ping me when you are done

2016-01-07T19:04:46 <zamcnema> Justin_o: it should be to the right
2016-01-07T19:05:18 <Justin_o> zamcnema: i wonder if your changes were overwritten by an npm install then... i\'ll try this again
2016-01-07T19:05:30 <zamcnema> Justin_o: this
2016-01-07T19:12:16 <zamcnema> Justin_o: We don\'t have a good set up atm, I had to include the node modules folder. you can could pull it, copy the nodemodules folder. do npm install etc. and then copy that back in there.

2016-01-07T20:15:32 <bens__> hi Justin_o: i\'d like to run some IoC reference thoughts by you
2016-01-07T20:15:59 <Justin_o> bens__: sure
2016-01-07T20:16:34 <bens__> reference the successHandler invoker definition here: https://github.com/GPII/first-discovery-server/blob/master/src/js/preferencesRouter.js#L67-L69
2016-01-07T20:17:53 <bens__> and how successHandler is the onResolve callback for the storePromise here: https://github.com/GPII/first-discovery-server/blob/master/src/js/preferencesRouter.js#L171
2016-01-07T20:18:53 <bens__> when the promise is resolved, that.successHandler will receive the promise value as its only argument
2016-01-07T20:20:21 <bens__> but.. successHandler is not really a function.. its an invoker (I think this is the infusion term).. and so it doesn\'t *really* receive the  promise value
2016-01-07T20:21:36 <bens__> instead, infusion remaps the call to the sendResponse function from the gpii.express.handler grade, and the framework provides sendResponse with 200 and the promise value as arguments
2016-01-07T20:23:58 <bens__> i notice that when I change the storePromise onResolve handler from that.successHandler to "function(value){ that.sendResponse(200, value); }" I get the same results from the browser\'s point of view
2016-01-07T20:24:25 <Justin_o> bens__: yes, that should be the same
2016-01-07T20:25:01 <Justin_o> successHandler is more of a convenience method
2016-01-07T20:25:55 <bens__> yes, and i see why, to hold the http 200 code :)
2016-01-07T20:26:12 <Justin_o> and i guess to provide some symmetry with the errorHandler method
2016-01-07T20:26:16 <bens__> i\'m just picking this piece apart as an exercise to understand how the code is executed
2016-01-07T20:27:03 <bens__> and so my question is... is what i described up above generally what infusion is doing?
2016-01-07T20:27:30 <Justin_o> but yes, essentially all it does as a convenience is to abstract away the success code and remove the need for the added function in the promise
2016-01-07T20:27:32 <Justin_o> so not much :)
2016-01-07T20:29:35 <Justin_o> bens__: in terms of invokers you followed it along quite well yes.. the invokers are meant to provide some indirection to reduce coupling and provide added flexibility.
2016-01-07T20:29:57 <Justin_o> you\'ve probably read this already, but the summary at the top is a pretty good explanation of what it\'s for http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/Invokers.html
2016-01-07T20:31:22 <Justin_o> so in this case that you described, if you wanted to say swap in a different concrete function for handling the success you could just change up the configuration here https://github.com/GPII/first-discovery-server/blob/master/src/js/preferencesRouter.js#L67-L69 and not have to modify the external api
2016-01-07T20:36:12 * kasparnet has quit
2016-01-07T20:36:38 <Justin_o> bens__: did that help?
2016-01-07T20:37:34 <bens__> Justin_o, yes, very much. i have read the invoker doc page, but just re-reading it now and with our discussion its clicking much better
2016-01-07T20:40:10 <Justin_o> bens__: cool feel free to ping me with any questions...
2016-01-07T20:40:28 <Justin_o> bens__: by the way do you know if zamcnema has gone home for the day?
2016-01-07T20:41:16 <bens__> thank you! zamcnema is still online, i\'ll ask him to rejoin irc
2016-01-07T20:41:30 <Justin_o> bens__: thanks
2016-01-07T20:42:31 * zamcnema joined the channel
2016-01-07T20:42:58 <zamcnema> Justin_o: Sorry I think the wifi went down and it logged me out
2016-01-07T20:43:15 <zamcnema> Justin_o: I had it sitting here open
2016-01-07T20:45:02 <Justin_o> zamcnema: no worries
2016-01-07T20:45:48 <Justin_o> zamcnema: so i\'ve found a couple of issues that will prevent your implementation from working.
2016-01-07T20:46:50 <Justin_o> zamcnema: so to start, this is the function that is called to initialize the first discovery tool https://github.com/zamcnema/first-discovery-previewpane/blob/master/node_modules/gpii-first-discovery/demos/index.html#L179
2016-01-07T20:48:34 <Justin_o> the first argument there is a "#gpiic-fd" is the container. The container is for scoping the interactions in the DOM. Essentially the classes and etc you provide in a selectors block are all scoped (within) this container. https://github.com/zamcnema/first-discovery-previewpane/blob/master/node_modules/gpii-first-discovery/src/js/firstDiscoveryEditor.js#L163
2016-01-07T20:49:04 <Justin_o> so there fist issue is that iframe is outside of this container\'s scoping https://github.com/zamcnema/first-discovery-previewpane/blob/master/node_modules/gpii-first-discovery/demos/index.html#L164-L176
2016-01-07T20:50:34 <Justin_o> so you have to get the iframe inside of this container, either move it into the div above or pull the container up so it encompasses both.
2016-01-07T20:51:13 * kasparnet joined the channel
2016-01-07T20:51:54 <Justin_o> now the probable reason why you were getting any errors is because your preview subcomponent was never initialized.
2016-01-07T20:52:31 <Justin_o> the reason of that, is that you have a circular reference in your events
2016-01-07T20:53:25 <Justin_o> the preview subcomponent has a create on event.https://github.com/zamcnema/first-discovery-previewpane/blob/master/node_modules/gpii-first-discovery/src/js/firstDiscoveryEditor.js#L130 This says, initialize when this event has fired.
2016-01-07T20:53:56 <Justin_o> However, the onReady event has been defined as an aggregate event. https://github.com/zamcnema/first-discovery-previewpane/blob/master/node_modules/gpii-first-discovery/src/js/firstDiscoveryEditor.js#L182-L186
2016-01-07T20:55:56 <Justin_o> an aggregate event only fires when all of it\'s sub events have fired. This allows you to perform a single action after some set of events.
2016-01-07T20:56:32 <Justin_o> so notice that the aggregate event is actually waiting for the previews own event https://github.com/zamcnema/first-discovery-previewpane/blob/master/node_modules/gpii-first-discovery/src/js/firstDiscoveryEditor.js#L185
2016-01-07T20:56:45 <Justin_o> so this onReady can never fire
2016-01-07T20:57:32 <Justin_o> for now you can try removing onReady altogether and changing the create on event to "onPrefsEditorReady" https://github.com/zamcnema/first-discovery-previewpane/blob/master/node_modules/gpii-first-discovery/src/js/firstDiscoveryEditor.js#L130
2016-01-07T20:57:44 <danayo> hi bens__, thought I heard mention of a demo coming up for the FD tool - is that tomorrow?
2016-01-07T20:58:39 * brendan_d has quit
2016-01-07T20:59:48 <Justin_o> zamcnema: so following all that should get you a nice 404 page in your preview window
2016-01-07T21:01:34 * kasparnet has quit
2016-01-07T21:03:16 <Justin_o> the next step would be to pass in the correct value for the template url. You could add templateUrl: "../src/html/PrefsEditorPreview.html" to the preview sub components options. That\'ll get the page to show up. A better way would be to pass this in from the init function, but you\'ll have to expand it to accept an options object so you could have something
2016-01-07T21:03:16 <Justin_o> more like this https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/tests/manual-tests/framework/preferences/fullPage-schema/index.html#L69-L74
2016-01-07T21:04:12 <Justin_o> the init method is just a convenience that added for the demos to reduce the amount of config that showed up in the html file, you can see it here https://github.com/zamcnema/first-discovery-previewpane/blob/master/node_modules/gpii-first-discovery/demos/js/demos.js#L18
2016-01-07T21:04:24 <bens__> danayo, no, next friday
2016-01-07T21:04:36 <bens__> January 15
2016-01-07T21:05:13 <Justin_o> zamcnema: also i notice the you are changing the main index.js file, rather than the prefsServerIntegration one https://github.com/zamcnema/first-discovery-previewpane/blob/master/node_modules/gpii-first-discovery/demos/prefsServerIntegration/index.html
2016-01-07T21:05:17 <Justin_o> was that intentional?
2016-01-07T21:05:26 <Justin_o> bens__: what time is that demo happening?
2016-01-07T21:05:40 <bens__> danayo, we\'ll have an invite out to the global prefs mailing list
2016-01-07T21:06:37 * simonjb has quit
2016-01-07T21:07:08 <zamcnema> Justin_o: I\'ll make sure i start using that one.
2016-01-07T21:07:27 <bens__> Justin_o, we haven\'t picked a time yet.. I was going to suggest 12:10 PM EST like last time (right after the stand up)
2016-01-07T21:07:39 <zamcnema> I\'ve messed with the server integration demo a few times when I was wokring with the preferences server.
2016-01-07T21:08:05 <Justin_o> zamcnema: ah okay, cool.. that should hopefully help you get past this first hurdle but you\'ll still need to wire up the enactors though.
2016-01-07T21:08:46 <Justin_o> zamcnema: also i\'m sure you\'re modifying the files in the node_modules so that it\'s easier to work with the server at the same time, just don\'t forget to move it back over to the first-discovery tool itself.
2016-01-07T21:09:02 <danayo> ok, thanks bens__
2016-01-07T21:09:21 <Justin_o> bens__: thanks
2016-01-07T21:09:49 <danayo> bens__: i\'m not usually around on Fridays, is there any chance you could do it another day?
2016-01-07T21:11:07 <zamcnema> Justin_o: Yes, this was just while I was working locally. My plan was to get the fdt that we are wokring on up on git, change the config on the first discovery server so it pulls that one in. that wya we could just push that folder from the node modules. That way we could wokr locally and then also be able to make commits
2016-01-07T21:12:20 <zamcnema> Justin_o: Thanks for the help! The more I work with it, the more I\'ll figure out.
2016-01-07T21:14:06 <bens__> danayo: definitely a chance, maybe we can combine with the monday afternoon requirements meeting which usually has a bit of a forum on it. i\'ll float that on our stand up tomorrow
2016-01-07T21:14:24 <danayo> great, thanks alot bens__

2016-01-07T15:00:02 <Justin_o> jhung: just tried the change/input issue on iOS 9.2 same issue.. so without VoiceOver on you get change and input events firing more like a mouse drag. With VoiceOver on you just get change events.
2016-01-07T15:02:27 * danayo joined the channel
2016-01-07T15:02:34 <jhung> Justin_o: ok. I wonder if we can keep working, and file a bug until it\'s fixed?
2016-01-07T15:07:01 <Justin_o> jhung: the problem is that it affects our descriptions, specifically for the hand movement as it will need to track the prior and current hand position. Because we have to handle both input and change events right now, we always get the message that the hand didn\'t move.
2016-01-07T15:07:34 <jhung> yeah that\'s very problematic Justin_o. Makes it broken on iOS with VoiceOver on.
2016-01-07T15:08:09 <Justin_o> its kind of broken everywhere right now
2016-01-07T15:08:38 <Justin_o> but i could change things so that it is only broken in iOS with VoiceOver on
2016-01-07T15:09:23 <jhung> that makes me sad Justin_o, but what choice do we have?

2016-01-07T15:57:20 <zamcnema> Justin_o: I\'m still trying to get this preview to work with the fdt. I tried it as a sibling and then also as a subcomponent under the prefsEditor. I feel like there are some naming conventions that I\'m not getting right on the low level and then maybe some connections that I may have missed on the high level.
2016-01-07T15:59:39 <zamcnema> Justin_o: would i just inherit the preview from somewhere in gpii as a grade? Right now I have been placing the preview code in a separate js file from the firstDiscovery editor similarly to how the other aspects of the fdt tool are (nav, helpbutton, etc).
2016-01-07T16:00:47 <Justin_o> zamcnema: i guess the answer may depend on how different it is from the existing preview compenent
2016-01-07T16:01:22 <Justin_o> zamcnema: if the changes are just minor, some change small config change, you could just use the preview component directly as the subcomponent and make changes in its options.
2016-01-07T16:02:16 <Justin_o> zamcnema: alternatively if there are more changes needed and it makes sense to create your own component, then you could add the preview as a gradeName in your component. This will merge in its options into your new component... this is kind of like inheritance but it isn\'t exactly.
2016-01-07T16:03:00 <Justin_o> zamcnema: you might be interested in http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/ComponentGrades.html
2016-01-07T16:03:27 <Justin_o> and http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/SubcomponentDeclaration.html
2016-01-07T16:03:54 <Justin_o> zamcnema: also if you have some code you could share I could see if I can take a quick look at it

2016-01-07T16:08:33 <zamcnema> Justin_o: Whats the best way to share code on the irc?
2016-01-07T16:09:37 <Justin_o> zamcnema: pastebin or something like that.. or if you have it in a public repo you could just share the link
2016-01-07T16:17:57 <zamcnema> Justin_o: Sorry, I had to go make an account. what would you like to see?
2016-01-07T16:19:08 <Justin_o> zamcnema: i guess what you\'re working on now, so where your preview code is and where you\'re integrating it i guess.
2016-01-07T16:20:56 <zamcnema> Justin_o: I\'m trying to use the code that you linked to me. I\'ve tried messing with the names, but I haven\'t had any luck. I\'ll get you some links
2016-01-07T16:23:01 <Justin_o> zamcnema: thanks
2016-01-07T16:25:00 <Justin_o> jhung: can you try this for me with firefox and some other browser https://jsfiddle.net/kw88vkLh/1/
2016-01-07T16:25:18 <Justin_o> and tell me if you see anything different about how the input and change events are fired
2016-01-07T16:26:52 <jhung> Seems okay Justin_o. Input and change events seem to be firing as expected.
2016-01-07T16:27:58 <Justin_o> jhung: i\'m noticing in FF that if you use the keyboard it doesn\'t fire change events, only input
2016-01-07T16:28:05 <Justin_o> but in other browsers i get both
2016-01-07T16:28:57 <jhung> oh Justin_o I just tried mouse. :D I see now. Change doesn\'t apply in FF until focus moves.

2016-01-07T16:29:39 <Justin_o> jhung: ah okay, i see that it is updated after focus moves now..
2016-01-07T16:29:44 <Justin_o> zamcnema: thanks

2016-01-07T16:38:16 <zamcnema> Justin_o: I noticed how the naming conventions werent the same as if n the other components (nav, helpbutton) so the first thing that I tried was changing that on the preview.js file and in the index.html markup. I wasn\'t getting the connectivity from the iframe to the html content stored in the PrefsEditorPreview.html file. I kept messing with it yesterday until i left. When I got here this morning I tried to reseting it back

2016-01-07T16:41:49 <zamcnema> Justin_o: and attempted to see if I could get it to connect to the markup that i found in the fullpreviewprefseditor in the project example that you linked me.
2016-01-07T16:45:09 <Justin_o> zamcnema: sorry had to run for my standup meeting here, just got back.. will look now.. by the way, are you getting any errors?
2016-01-07T16:45:43 <zamcnema> Justin_o: after that I tried the same thing only through declaring it as a subcomponent of the prefsEditor in the firstDiscoveryEditor. At this point I get the feeling that I\'m missing something simple or something really big.

2016-01-07T16:47:16 <zamcnema> Justin_o: I\'m just getting the console errors that normally pop up for the fdt. I wish it would give me some. that would actually be helpful.
2016-01-07T16:48:09 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2016-01-07T16:48:10 <Justin_o> zamcnema: so what you are seeing when you run this is that the iframe is populated but it doesn\'t update as you make changes?
2016-01-07T16:49:20 <zamcnema> Justin: I\'m getting the html stuff
2016-01-07T16:49:48 <zamcnema> Justin: but nothing from the iframes template
2016-01-07T16:50:00 <zamcnema> so its just an empty box
2016-01-07T16:51:36 <Justin_o> zamcnema: i think this is wrong "{prefsEditor}.dom.previewFrame"
2016-01-07T16:51:46 <Justin_o> it should probably be "{that}.dom.previewFrame"

2016-01-07T16:53:55 <zamcnema> Justin_o: I\'ve been checking the iframe with the dev tools too, all i\'m getting are a pair of html,head,body tags
2016-01-07T16:55:38 <Justin_o> zamcnema: can you send the markup that has the previewFrame selector
2016-01-07T16:57:55 <zamcnema> Justin_o: http://pastebin.com/mrizY8Gs
2016-01-07T16:58:09 <zamcnema> Justin_o: I have to run to a stand up brb
2016-01-07T17:02:00 <Justin_o> zamcnema: ah you sent me that, but i wasn\'t sure if it was the entire thing... it seems that it\'s separate from the rest of the tool though. So I\'m not sure how you are getting the frame.
2016-01-07T17:05:38 <zamcnema> Justin_o: I\'ll get you the rest of the html for that page,
2016-01-07T17:05:45 <Justin_o> zamcnema: thanks
2016-01-07T17:14:01 <zamcnema> Justin_o: I\'m working out of a first discovery server clone, I\'ll see about getting that up on my github for you.
2016-01-07T17:14:15 <Justin_o> zamcnema: cool thanks

2016-01-07T17:48:00 <bens__> hi Justin_o: i\'m trying to run frist-discovery-server on my laptop here and had a question about the auth server. based on the vagrant config for development there should be a auth server at listening on your host machine at port 8081 that the first-discovery-server talks to. Can you point me towards what you were running there? Was it one of the OAuth 2 example servers referenced from here: https://github.com/GPII/universal/tree/master/gpii/node_modules/g
2016-01-07T17:48:01 <bens__> pii-oauth2 ?
2016-01-07T17:48:29 <bens__> unbroken link: https://github.com/GPII/universal/tree/master/gpii/node_modules/gpii-oauth2
2016-01-07T17:49:41 <Justin_o> bens__: from the root of universal i ran the following:
2016-01-07T17:49:44 <Justin_o> NODE_ENV=cloudBased.development.all.local node gpii.js
2016-01-07T18:00:15 <Justin_o> bens__: did that work for you?
2016-01-07T18:00:43 <bens__> I have not tried it yet but i think i just finished tracing through some of the config
2016-01-07T18:00:59 <bens__> the flowManager dev config pulls in this file: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/security/TestOAuth2DataStore.js
2016-01-07T18:01:37 <bens__> so I could grab the client id and secret there for something or add my own and use the values in my FD-Server environment vars
2016-01-07T18:02:36 <Justin_o> bens__: yes, that\'s correct.. this will be converted to a proper database at some point too, but till then you could make those changes in this file or use something that already exists there

2016-01-07T18:23:03 <zamcnema> Justin_o: I\'ve got you a link to my clone of the fdserver that I was developing on. I had to remove the gitignore for the nodemodules or else it would have just overwritten the stuff I was working on with the fdt branch.

2016-01-07T18:23:36 <Justin_o> zamcnema: thanks, i\'ll take a look at that
2016-01-07T18:24:19 <zamcnema> Justin_o: nah, thank you, I appreciate the help.
