b'2016-06-23T17:52:44 <colinclark> I think what I\'ll do is to make a pull request to you with my changes
2016-06-23T17:52:47 <colinclark> from 1 am
2016-06-23T17:52:59 <colinclark> I was terribly confused last night thinking I\'d broken the universe
2016-06-23T17:53:09 <colinclark> but it looks like we\'ve got some race conditions here
2016-06-23T17:53:25 <colinclark> if it\'s of use, I can continue to debug things
2016-06-23T17:53:40 <colinclark> or I can leave it and you can pick it up post-vacation
2016-06-23T17:54:12 <alanharnum> i\'ll pick it up after vacation
2016-06-23T17:54:26 <alanharnum> i personally suspect it\'s an issue in all-tests
2016-06-23T17:54:41 <alanharnum> i see similar behaviour (random failures that go away) in all-tests in Infusion itself
2016-06-23T17:55:20 <colinclark> alanharnum: I\'m not sure they\'re similar
2016-06-23T17:55:38 <colinclark> at this point, if you\'re running the latest version, there shouldn\'t be any random failures
2016-06-23T17:56:09 <colinclark> we\'d hopefully see them fail in CI if that were the case
2016-06-23T17:56:19 <colinclark> though there might be some outstanding PRs for me to review first
2016-06-23T17:56:37 <colinclark> but Bosmon fixed some issues related to the random failures in the Preferences Framework

2016-06-23T20:43:24 <alanharnum> whoah
2016-06-23T20:43:33 <alanharnum> i like good news
2016-06-23T20:43:43 <colinclark> it\'s only good-ish :)
2016-06-23T20:43:50 <alanharnum> well
2016-06-23T20:43:53 <alanharnum> i\'ll hear it anyway
2016-06-23T20:43:55 <colinclark> I decided to upgrade our copy of Infusion
2016-06-23T20:44:02 <colinclark> I am now seeing Real Failures
2016-06-23T20:44:06 <colinclark> instead of mystery errors
2016-06-23T20:44:17 <colinclark> oh wait
2016-06-23T20:44:20 <colinclark> Not so mystery
2016-06-23T20:44:29 <colinclark> cindyli1 moved the resource loader :)
2016-06-23T20:44:34 <colinclark> alanharnum: ignore me :P
2016-06-23T20:44:57 <alanharnum> yes, if that\'s in Infusion master now, upgrading Infusion will break CA :)
2016-06-23T20:45:10 <cindyli1> yes, with the new name "fluid.resourceLoader"
2016-06-23T20:45:22 <cindyli1> rather than using "fluid.prefs" namespace

2016-06-23T20:45:33 <colinclark> ok great
2016-06-23T20:45:50 <colinclark> i will see what i can do while i sit in meetings
2016-06-23T20:46:34 <gtirloni_> i thought this was supposed to be good-ish news
2016-06-23T20:47:14 <michelled> he did say \'ish\'
2016-06-23T20:47:32 <gtirloni_> haha
2016-06-23T20:50:09 <colinclark> gtirloni_: GOOD NEWS! I\'M CONFUSED!

b'2016-06-23T15:20:49 <colinclark> yeah, totally
2016-06-23T15:21:11 <colinclark> but it seems those demos don\'t actually incorporate many of the performance optimizations we make available for integrators to use
2016-06-23T15:21:19 <colinclark> such as, as you\'ve pointed out, concatenated and minified files
2016-06-23T15:21:43 <colinclark> plus include the added overhead of things like the panel
2016-06-23T15:22:05 <colinclark> in the end, perhaps your app will be a demo or example code for how to performantly integrate UIO into a site

2016-06-23T15:24:23 <Justin_o> that\'s some of the information i was looking at when i was exploring lazy loading
2016-06-23T15:25:07 <Justin_o> colinclark: so were you saying to make an example that uses what we have now, but with all the currently available optimizations employed?
2016-06-23T15:25:15 <colinclark> yes
2016-06-23T15:25:28 <colinclark> i.e. something that you believe represents "real world" usage of UIO
2016-06-23T15:29:04 <Justin_o> gtirloni, avtar: do you know if the vagrant server gzips things?
2016-06-23T15:30:32 <gtirloni> Justin_o, it should. any issues?
2016-06-23T15:30:46 <bens__> Justin_o, if you can look at the http headers for a file check for content-encoding: gzip as a response header
2016-06-23T15:30:48 <Justin_o> gtirloni: no just checking if i can use that for what colinclark is suggesting

2016-06-23T16:55:06 <jhung> Hi styki, how is it going?
2016-06-23T17:00:36 <styki> Hi jhung, cindyli and Justin_o. I wanted to ask a question about the TextfieldSlider and how to make it a button for the responsive version.
2016-06-23T17:01:19 * simonjb joined the channel
2016-06-23T17:01:58 <styki> The type of the slider is defined in slider.type. I can make a contextAwareness to make it of type buttons. This will cause minimum problem when merging, but it is not very logical to have the buttons defined as a type of slider.
2016-06-23T17:02:12 <styki> Do you think I should do it?
2016-06-23T17:02:21 * Bosmon7 joined the channel
2016-06-23T17:04:10 <cindyli> styki: so you are thinking to swap out the slider part of the textfieldSlider?
2016-06-23T17:05:46 <cindyli> i\'m thinking it might make more sense to swap out the entire textfield slider
2016-06-23T17:05:49 <styki> cindyli: Yes will replace it with buttons, but if I make a new file for the version with buttons and textfield it might cause so problems.
2016-06-23T17:05:57 <styki> some*
2016-06-23T17:06:13 <cindyli> what problems it may cause?
2016-06-23T17:06:33 * alanharn_ joined the channel
2016-06-23T17:07:22 <colinclark> hey alanharn_, Can I ask you a funny question?
2016-06-23T17:07:22 <styki> Well it will have a different structure in a separate file and if we merge the native slider there might be some conflicts that have to resolved.
2016-06-23T17:07:34 <alanharn_> colinclark: sure
2016-06-23T17:07:36 * alanharn_ is now known as alanharnum
2016-06-23T17:07:56 <colinclark> Is there a secret to getting the CA Tool tests to pass consistently?
2016-06-23T17:09:04 <alanharnum> colinclark: one thing I have seen be an issue is having Developer Tools open when running all-tests
2016-06-23T17:09:13 <colinclark> hmm
2016-06-23T17:09:22 <colinclark> What happens when that is the case?
2016-06-23T17:09:57 <styki> cindyli: We can use the contextAwareness in the native slider refactor branch and make three types of slider: native, jQuery and buttons.
2016-06-23T17:10:51 <alanharnum> colinclark: it runs through all the tests and fails on the chartAuthoring tests, typically
2016-06-23T17:11:03 <alanharnum> colinclark: the tests may also fail in a browser that doesn\'t support TTS, like FF
2016-06-23T17:11:48 <colinclark> Okay, so two more questions
2016-06-23T17:12:02 <alanharnum> i generally haven\'t had a problem with inconsistent behaviour with the current tests
2016-06-23T17:12:24 * cindyli joined the channel
2016-06-23T17:12:37 <colinclark> 1. What kind of failure or error do you see when the tests fail with the developer tools open
2016-06-23T17:12:43 <colinclark> 2. What browsers do you support?
2016-06-23T17:12:45 <jhung> styki: I think in this case we would want to create a new adjuster for the button text size, and use the contextawareness to swap it with the slider.
2016-06-23T17:13:08 <jhung> this way we wouldn
2016-06-23T17:13:31 <jhung> \'t have any merge conflicts since the slider and buttons are different things (subcomponents?)
2016-06-23T17:13:40 <cindyli> sorry, styki, my internet is unstable today, got disconnected just now
2016-06-23T17:13:54 <Justin_o> styki: yah, it\'d be a bit strange to have a textFieldSlider component that was actually a button. I think making the change higher up the component tree makes more sense.
2016-06-23T17:14:25 <colinclark> alanharnum: ^
2016-06-23T17:15:06 <alanharnum> colinclark: 1) The Dev Tools failure gives the message "DevTools was disconnected from the page", and the Google Chrome "Aw, Snap!" something went wrong page. THat\'s in Chrome, obviously.
2016-06-23T17:15:25 <styki> ok I can make a new options lets say incrementing element which can be either a slider or buttons.
2016-06-23T17:15:31 <alanharnum> 1a) I also occasionally get random reds when running the all-tests - I get this when running all-tests for Infusion as well
2016-06-23T17:15:32 * wale has quit
2016-06-23T17:15:35 <styki> Does that sound more logical?
2016-06-23T17:16:16 <alanharnum> 2) Officially, Safari and Chrome due to the need for TTS. It works in FF (last time I tested) if you turn on the TTS option there. I believe it worked in Edge when I tried it, but that was some time ago.
2016-06-23T17:16:21 <colinclark> alanharnum: Can you characterize the "random reds"
2016-06-23T17:16:24 <alanharnum> colinclark: ^
2016-06-23T17:16:54 <Justin_o> styki: when you say new option, do you mean you\'d change the member name in the adjuster from textFieldSlider to incrementer or something like that?
2016-06-23T17:16:56 <cindyli> styki: isn\'t it the same idea of replacing a slider with buttons?
2016-06-23T17:17:16 <alanharnum> colinclark: seemingly random test failures when running the all-tests runner, which go away when running all-tests again, or when the test is individually run
2016-06-23T17:17:39 <colinclark> multiple tests or a single test?
2016-06-23T17:17:48 <alanharnum> multiple
2016-06-23T17:18:20 <colinclark> I\'m seeing a lot of these:
2016-06-23T17:18:21 <colinclark> "Error coordinating QUnit-composite - assertion issued outside test context"
2016-06-23T17:18:31 <alanharnum> weird
2016-06-23T17:18:34 <colinclark> Along with quite frequent hangs in Safari
2016-06-23T17:18:37 <alanharnum> never seen anything like that
2016-06-23T17:18:41 <colinclark> can you do me a favour?
2016-06-23T17:18:57 <alanharnum> sure
2016-06-23T17:19:04 <colinclark> Can you update to flocking#b5874e5f88d01408effc01cc0e36e7bf0defae14 and run the tests a bunch of times
2016-06-23T17:19:08 <colinclark> in Chrome and Safari?
2016-06-23T17:20:08 <alanharnum> doing so now
2016-06-23T17:20:23 <styki> I meant that currently in the TextfieldSlider.js file we have a fluid.textfieldslider.component and in it a slider. My Idea was to change it to incrementer.
2016-06-23T17:21:13 <styki> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/components/textfieldSlider/js/TextfieldSlider.js#L32
2016-06-23T17:22:46 <alanharnum> colinclark: first all-tests run on Chrome: legend, pieChart and Sonifier tests fail. they pass on a rerun.
2016-06-23T17:23:01 <colinclark> can you run \'em a bunch more times?
2016-06-23T17:23:43 <Justin_o> styki: i don\'t think that makes sense unless you completely rename the component as a whole.
2016-06-23T17:24:05 <Justin_o> styki: i think that component is quite specifically a textfield and a slider
2016-06-23T17:25:05 <Justin_o> styki: i could see you making a change like that in the text size adjuster though. https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/preferences/js/Panels.js#L669
2016-06-23T17:25:33 <styki> Justin_o: yeah, I agree. So guess I should make a new file textfieldButtons and use the contextAwareness to make changes between the files?
2016-06-23T17:25:58 <Justin_o> styki: yah.. i don\'t now if danayo had a name for those ui elements
2016-06-23T17:26:14 <alanharnum> colinclark: got same failure again in Chrome. Safari seems to hang on the final test.
2016-06-23T17:26:52 <colinclark> ok
2016-06-23T17:26:52 <alanharnum> safari repeates the "Updated Label Three" TTS twice when running the chart authoring test, then goes no further, which I think is a regression
2016-06-23T17:27:02 <alanharnum> not sure what\'s going on there, looking at it more closely
2016-06-23T17:27:03 <colinclark> so I don\'t know how to address this
2016-06-23T17:27:07 <colinclark> since the tests were failing before
2016-06-23T17:27:16 <colinclark> so it\'s pretty hard to know if they were ever able to pass
2016-06-23T17:28:41 <jhung> Justin_o, I don\'t think the name of it is a huge issue right now. We can fix that later since this is all in styki\'s branch currently.
2016-06-23T17:29:06 <jhung> besides, we take a long time to name things - GSoC might be over by then. :D
2016-06-23T17:29:07 <cindyli> styki, Justin_o, depending on the design of the mobile text size panel, styki might need to make a new panel. as i rmb, there\'s no label or description on the mobile version
2016-06-23T17:29:29 <cindyli> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/preferences/js/Panels.js#L665
2016-06-23T17:30:06 <cindyli> also, the new panel can make use of a new template, which might be easier than hacking thru the current text size template
2016-06-23T17:30:23 <Justin_o> cindyli: that\'s probably okay, in that those selectors my just not get used. I think the render will just ignore it.. i hope
2016-06-23T17:30:24 <alanharnum> colinclark: they\'ve definitely all passed in the past, i\'m not sure what\'s going on
2016-06-23T17:30:38 <alanharnum> they\'ve consistently worked best in Chrome, but Safari has also all passed previously
2016-06-23T17:30:50 <Justin_o> cindyli: that\'s true.. but this stuff does need to change on the fly
2016-06-23T17:30:55 <styki> cindyli: I will probably do a different template.
2016-06-23T17:31:22 <cindyli> sounds good, styki, Justin_o
2016-06-23T17:32:05 <Justin_o> cindyli, styli: also the selector variations could probably be addressed via the context awareness stuff too
2016-06-23T17:32:43 <alanharnum> colinclark: where are you seeibng the "Error coordinating QUnit-composite - assertion issued outside test context" failures?
2016-06-23T17:33:04 <colinclark> alanharnum: Chrome
2016-06-23T17:33:19 <alanharnum> in the devtools? In any particular test?
2016-06-23T17:33:21 <cindyli> Justin_o: do u mean the selectors of fluid.panel.textSize?
2016-06-23T17:33:22 <alanharnum> trying to see it myself
2016-06-23T17:34:07 <cindyli> that is this section - https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/preferences/js/Panels.js#L659-L666
2016-06-23T17:35:02 <Justin_o> cindyli: yes, like the description one, that could be all swapped in and out as needed.. kind of like what alanharnum did for the native vs jQuery sliders, where there is a common grade and the other grades have the specific parts.
2016-06-23T17:35:30 <cindyli> ok, that makes sense
2016-06-23T17:36:28 <styki> Ok I will give it a thought and text here if somethings comes up , cindyli, Justin_o, jhung.
2016-06-23T17:36:37 <Justin_o> styki: cool, good lukc
2016-06-23T17:36:39 <cindyli> cool. thanks, styki
2016-06-23T17:36:40 <Justin_o> luck
2016-06-23T17:37:14 <jhung> great. Feel free to come in the channel anytime styki
2016-06-23T17:43:47 * cindyli has quit
2016-06-23T17:45:46 <colinclark> alanharnum: it\'s pretty consistently the legend, piechart and chartauthoring tests
2016-06-23T17:45:53 <colinclark> of course they don\'t occur when i run the tests individually
2016-06-23T17:48:03 <colinclark> alanharnum: I don\'t see any different with dev tools on or off
2016-06-23T17:48:06 <colinclark> which is good :)
2016-06-23T17:48:10 * jhung has quit
2016-06-23T17:48:16 <alanharnum> colinclark: ok, so that\'s at least the same thing I see
2016-06-23T17:48:27 <colinclark> It seems to me that there are two potential explanations
2016-06-23T17:48:31 <colinclark> just to point out the obvious
2016-06-23T17:48:32 <alanharnum> i wonder if it\'s because those ones all asynchronously load template files
2016-06-23T17:48:38 <colinclark> interesting!
2016-06-23T17:49:02 <alanharnum> i believe that\'s the common point between them
2016-06-23T17:49:11 <colinclark> Either repeatedly creating and destroying the Flocking environment is an issue
2016-06-23T17:49:19 <colinclark> or we\'ve got an issue in the tests themselves
2016-06-23T17:49:38 <colinclark> I\'m leaning towards the latter, if only because I have a lot of Flocking tests that repeatedly create and destroy environments like this
2016-06-23T17:50:19 <alanharnum> legend and pieChart also don\'t use flocking in any way
2016-06-23T17:50:30 <alanharnum> and sonifier does, but doesn\'t use the IoC tests
2016-06-23T17:50:51 <alanharnum> the common point (at least for those three random failures) would seem to be loading templates asychronously

2016-06-23T13:27:08 <jhernandez_> and thanks for the time you\'re taking to review my work on the extension
2016-06-23T13:27:11 <jhernandez_> :)
2016-06-23T13:27:13 <Justin_o> jhernandez_: hello
2016-06-23T13:27:55 <jhernandez_> as I said in https://github.com/GPII/gpii-chrome-extension/pull/1#issuecomment-228048595, I need to create a pull request for univrsal to add this solution
2016-06-23T13:28:18 <Justin_o> jhernandez_: hey no problem.. I\'m almost finished looking over it all again. It looks like it is really close.
2016-06-23T13:29:51 <jhernandez_> right now I\'m testing it by using the already supported com.ilunion.cloud4chrome solution, as stated here https://github.com/GPII/gpii-chrome-extension/pull/1/files#diff-a7885c5d019b65f034ed9db28a428799R84
2016-06-23T13:30:25 <jhernandez_> yeah, thanks, it\'s starting to look really good - and the most important, I\'m learning a lot
2016-06-23T13:30:30 <jhernandez_> :)
2016-06-23T13:31:11 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2016-06-23T13:31:31 <Justin_o> jhernandez_: thanks... i was testing it on a mac anyways, so i didn\'t really expect it work. My comment was more about having some documentation for what you\'ll need to get all the pieces into place. So a mention that you need GPII running on the same machine and if there is any specific config needed. Something like that.. actually it would be good if the
2016-06-23T13:31:31 <Justin_o> plugin could tell you that GPII is missing or couldn\'t be found. I\'m not sure how difficult that would be to do. For example when you click on the plugin icon in the browser, it could notify you of the issue maybe.
2016-06-23T13:33:20 <jhernandez_> Justin_o: wrt testing it on mac, it can be done easily ;)
2016-06-23T13:33:52 <jhernandez_> wrt having all the pieces in place, will add all the details in the README.md
2016-06-23T13:34:18 <Justin_o> jhernandez_: cool thanks :)
2016-06-23T13:36:14 <jhernandez_> Justin_o: wrt the plugin notifiyng that the local GPII couldn\'t be found or related issues, I\'m already working on an infusion wrapper around https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/notifications

2016-06-23T14:12:54 <Justin_o> Bosmon, alanharn_, colinclark: I may have some time while I\'m waiting on some PhET stuff to continue work on the UIO / Prefs Framework optimizations
2016-06-23T14:13:05 <Justin_o> i was talking to alanharn_ a bit before I left yesterday
2016-06-23T14:13:08 <colinclark> awesome, Justin_o
2016-06-23T14:13:10 * alanharn_ is now known as alanharnum
2016-06-23T14:13:38 <Justin_o> one thing that came up with that is to reduce the number of requests
2016-06-23T14:14:11 <Justin_o> for example merging templates and message bundles as part of the build
2016-06-23T14:15:01 <Justin_o> alanharnum: i feel like i\'m missing something there, was there something else we talked about
2016-06-23T14:15:14 <alanharnum> Justin_o: lazy loading
2016-06-23T14:15:47 <alanharnum> also possibly the idea of having a build option that puts the templates straight into the JS files, so that they don\'t require a separate AJAX request
2016-06-23T14:17:08 <bens__> Justin_o, my two thoughts: also minify the combined files and ensure response compression is being used
2016-06-23T14:19:32 <Justin_o> bens__: thanks.. yes, we do provide the option to minify and concatenate the js files. The integrator could choose to use this.
2016-06-23T14:19:46 <Justin_o> bens__: is "response compression" something they set on their server?
2016-06-23T14:19:58 <bens__> Justin_o, yes, aka "gzip"
2016-06-23T14:20:07 <Justin_o> ah yes. okay..
2016-06-23T14:20:16 <bens__> or in node it would be compression middleware
2016-06-23T14:21:23 <Justin_o> avtar, gtirloni: out of curiosity do you know if we have "response compression" enabled on our sites?
2016-06-23T14:22:06 <gtirloni> Justin_o, yes, gzip
2016-06-23T14:22:55 * wale_ joined the channel
2016-06-23T14:23:17 <Justin_o> bens__: cool, do you have some thoughts on what we could do at the "framework developer" level to help improve optimization or at least to provide integrators with more options to use
2016-06-23T14:24:47 <Justin_o> gtirloni: thanks for keeping our sites so speedy :)
2016-06-23T14:24:51 <gtirloni> :)
2016-06-23T14:26:03 <bens__> Justin_o, is there a demo site for UIO / Prefs Framework? maybe this one? http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/prefsFramework/

2016-06-23T14:26:58 <Justin_o> bens__: yep that\'s a good one.. there\'s also this one http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/uiOptions/ which is the "default" UI Options version
2016-06-23T14:27:31 <Justin_o> bens__: alanharnum is working on a PR to switch the jQuery UI Sliders to use native html sliders, which will reduce some of the JS includes in the iframe.

2016-06-23T14:46:45 <clown> bonjour jhernandez_, I have one more question about alwaysInstalled:  is it functional?
2016-06-23T14:47:10 <clown> This is  marked, "needs work": https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/407
2016-06-23T14:48:31 <clown> But, in the the GPII master branch, the windows solutions registry testdata has an "alwaysInstalled".  See: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/solutions/win32.json#L1442
2016-06-23T14:53:16 <bens__> Justin_o, i think the idea of combining resources as you mentioned is the best thing to do now, then minify the 1 or 2 js and css files at build time. Looking at the NOAA example there is lots of time spent stalled waiting to request small resources
2016-06-23T14:54:32 <bens__> Justin_o, from a framework developer perspective, I would make it required for integrators to use a packaging system that bundles and minifies all the resources (or at least make it difficult for them to not do this)
2016-06-23T14:56:15 <Justin_o> bens__: thanks for the feedback. We don\'t currently concatenate and minify the css, although it\'s something else we should explore. The CSS for the prefs framework is compiled using Stylus, so there should be an option for packaging it.
2016-06-23T14:57:12 <bens__> Justin_o, maybe point integrators at some background info for page speed in the framework documentation too. In the first demo, would NOAA be the integrator?
2016-06-23T14:58:55 <Justin_o> bens__: also interesting idea about the requirement to use the bundle. I\'ve been thinking about having the build system re-write the includes to use the single js file for example. We haven\'t fully figured out how we want our modularization to work and etc. yet though.
2016-06-23T15:00:23 <clown> jhernandez_, I think I\'ve answered my own question.  Is possible that the "alwaysInstalled" is a key that the system just takes as meaning "true"?
2016-06-23T15:00:25 * PaliwalSparsh has quit
2016-06-23T15:00:44 <bens__> Justin_o, right, thats probably not easy to do, but i\'d try and force it on integrators to try and force their workflow just a little. Maybe the way jQuery UI lets users choose which components to use (http://jqueryui.com/download/)
2016-06-23T15:01:25 <clown> It looks like Integration.js acts that way:  https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/testing/src/Integration.js#L445
2016-06-23T15:02:40 <jhernandez_> clown: you got it!
2016-06-23T15:02:43 <jhernandez_> :)
2016-06-23T15:03:36 <jhernandez_> see https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/deviceReporter/src/DeviceReporterUtilities.js#L30-L37
2016-06-23T15:03:38 <jhernandez_> :)
2016-06-23T15:04:47 <bens__> Justin_o, I would suggest starting with the concatenation approach because I think it has the biggest bang for the buck, then evaluate what the next best optimization is. Picking on a request in the NOAA example, there is a StarterSchemas.js file that  is 1.5 KB in size. The big timing info there is stalled for 440ms, waiting for 70, and downloading < 3. There is a similar story for lots of the js files downloaded.
2016-06-23T15:04:59 <Justin_o> bens__: yes we can do something like that too https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion#custom-build
2016-06-23T15:05:00 <bens__> Justin_o, concatenation should get rid of much of the "stalled" time
2016-06-23T15:05:00 <clown> jhernandez_  thanks.
2016-06-23T15:05:29 <clown> To summarize:  one can use "alwayInstalled" now, even though your pull request has not been merged yet.  Right?
2016-06-23T15:06:17 <clown> When I say \'one can use "alwaysInstalled"\', I mean it can be used in the test case definition in a test spec.
2016-06-23T15:08:08 <clown> aha, I just got an email from github that says DR.alwaysInstalled() has been partially merged into master.  Thanks jhernandez_
2016-06-23T15:09:37 * wale joined the channel
2016-06-23T15:11:10 <Justin_o> bens__: thanks for looking at that.. it would probably be good if our demos were using a concatenated build. part of that was our lack of source maps, which we have a PR for now https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/723
2016-06-23T15:12:32 <bens__> Justin_o, heh, i think we\'ve reached the same conclusion that concatentate = good. Would the person adding the UIO to their website be the integrator or framework developer as you mentioned earlier?
2016-06-23T15:12:54 * wale_ has quit
2016-06-23T15:14:41 <colinclark> Justin_o: Out of curiosity, do you have a test application set up that you\'re using to profile the performance of UIO? i.e. one that incorporates the optimizations that bens__ has mentioned that we already support for an integrator (such as concat/minified files) and that includes other basics such as compression?
2016-06-23T15:16:58 <Justin_o> colinclark: I don\'t yet, but that would be interesting to set up.. we could have a few instances to compare against
2016-06-23T15:17:24 <colinclark> Seems to me that any optimization is premature optimization until you have a way to gather metrics
2016-06-23T15:17:30 <jhernandez_> clown: avec plaisir! :)
2016-06-23T15:17:32 <colinclark> so I\'d do that as your first step, Justin_o
2016-06-23T15:17:38 <Justin_o> bens__: we usually refer to integrators as that
2016-06-23T15:17:57 <colinclark> Build a simple Node.js app that does the work that you assume a performance-minded integrator will do
2016-06-23T15:18:17 <colinclark> and then you\'ve got a set of baseline measurements from which you can optimize
2016-06-23T15:19:16 <bens__> Justin_o, wouldn\'t the http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/prefsFramework/ and http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/uiOptions/ demos be examples of the baseline apps to compare against?
2016-06-23T15:20:02 <Justin_o> bens__, colinclark: actually i have gathered some metrics based on those demos.
2016-06-23T15:20:39 <Justin_o> actually i had used a manual test because it didn\'t have the overview panel. http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/tests/manual-tests/framework/preferences/assortedContent/
