2016-03-10T17:31:32 <PaliwalSparsh1> @Justin_o I was about to start on working on my proposal for "Game for First Discovery of Preferences". I am thinking of implementing where preferences are set upfront in a game-like interface; once this process is complete the user enters the game I have got the idea of discovering and learning the preference, for the game I wanted to know about the target audience which would affect the type of game it would be. also do I need to prepare a
2016-03-10T17:31:32 <PaliwalSparsh1> demo for it.

2016-03-10T17:44:05 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh2:  for demo, you mean for your proposal or if you are accepted for the final deliverable?
2016-03-10T17:44:18 <Justin_o> danayo: do you have thoughts on the target audience for the game
2016-03-10T17:45:43 <PaliwalSparsh2> I was asking demo to for the proposal, is it necessary.
2016-03-10T17:47:41 <PaliwalSparsh2> For the target audience I was looking at the GPII website and I guess the audience can be of any age it is to serve as a demo for assistive technology to aid people.
2016-03-10T17:54:06 <kasparnet> Bosmon: goooood morning bossman!
2016-03-10T17:54:51 <danayo> Justin_o, PaliwalSparsh2: well, the target audience could be quite broad actually. Really it\'s anyone who is new to setting preferences (and probably also quite new to using computer devices)
2016-03-10T17:55:12 <danayo> It could be young kids or could also be seniors
2016-03-10T17:56:20 * himank has quit
2016-03-10T17:56:21 <danayo> or anything in between :)
2016-03-10T17:57:05 <PaliwalSparsh2> Great that is what I wanted to clear. So I guess we would need a game that interests all. Also can you tell me about the demo do I need it along with the proposal.
2016-03-10T17:57:47 * nrda joined the channel
2016-03-10T17:59:21 <colinclark> PaliwalSparsh2: I guess part of what danayo might have been suggesting is that you could decide on a particular audience
2016-03-10T17:59:48 <colinclark> rather than making it interesting for all, it\'s a valid design decision for your project to narrow in on one group, for example children or seniors
2016-03-10T18:00:03 <danayo> yes colinclark, I was just typing that there could be different versions for different audiences
2016-03-10T18:00:12 <danayo> (but I also think that even something like Discovery Cats could be fun for seniors)
2016-03-10T18:00:13 <colinclark> even better, yes!
2016-03-10T18:00:38 <colinclark> As far a demo, I don\'t think you need to produce one for your proposal--but if you have sketches or ideas that you can put into the proposal, that helps a lot
2016-03-10T18:03:14 <PaliwalSparsh2> I will be up with sketches and ideas. Everyone likes cats :) I will think over it work on a design and iterate over it with your help.

2016-03-10T18:56:12 <akshay> @danayo @colinclark In the game that I\'m proposing I\'m narrowing the target audience to kids/young students so that it can serve multiple purposes.
2016-03-10T18:57:03 <akshay> One is definitely of teach/informing about idea of setting preferences
2016-03-10T18:58:05 <akshay> and the other is to making them familiar with the device itself + enhancing their mathematical skills and vocabulary.
2016-03-10T19:00:53 <akshay> Also several benefits of GPII like assistance on demand , access ad learning and instant setup would also be achieved via the game.
2016-03-10T19:00:53 * jessm joined the channel
2016-03-10T19:02:26 <akshay> Moreover the design of the preference framework as a game(interfacing the fluid infusion with phaser) would be modular and could be extended to build any other
2016-03-10T19:02:54 <akshay> web application apart from the particular game that I\'m proposing
2016-03-10T19:03:20 <akshay> @danayo, I hope you went through this https://github.com/AkshayAgarwal007/First-Discovery-of-Preferences.
2016-03-10T19:14:08 <akshay> Would it be a good idea to extend the game to support gesture control devices like Myo or should the concentration be more on things that could be achieved without
2016-03-10T19:14:16 <akshay> extra hardware.

2016-03-10T21:00:01 <colinclark> hey Bosmon
2016-03-10T21:01:03 <colinclark> michelled1 was asking me about the P4A architecture document and whether it was in the wiki
2016-03-10T21:01:23 <colinclark> and I couldn\'t remember if you had migrated the Nexus section to the wiki or if it\'s still marooned in google docs
2016-03-10T21:02:25 <Bosmon7> Hi colinclark - I looked at the P4A architecture document for a while and realised that it was "too good" to be moved to the wiki : P
2016-03-10T21:02:32 <colinclark> hahaha
2016-03-10T21:02:36 <colinclark> formatting-wise?
2016-03-10T21:02:44 <Bosmon7> It\'s just too well-produced, with fine diagrams and tables
2016-03-10T21:02:51 <colinclark> yeah
2016-03-10T21:02:52 <Bosmon7> It would be wrecked by being moved to the wiki
2016-03-10T21:02:52 <Bosmon7> Yes
2016-03-10T21:03:02 <Bosmon7> So I just pointed Clayton at the existing doc
2016-03-10T21:03:11 <Bosmon7> I guess we\'ll just have to turn it into a proper "paper" of some kind somewhere
2016-03-10T21:03:26 <colinclark> yes, we will
2016-03-10T21:03:40 <colinclark> but in the meantime, I\'m guessing michelled1 wants to link to it for the yearly report
2016-03-10T21:04:01 <colinclark> So maybe I should just export a PDF or something and link it to the wiki
2016-03-10T21:04:07 <colinclark> or roll up my sleeves and do the migration
2016-03-10T21:04:09 <Bosmon7> Perhaps we could just attach it to our "presentations" page in the wiki as Word or so
2016-03-10T21:04:09 <Bosmon7> Right
2016-03-10T21:04:17 <colinclark> Word is probably more accessible, sadly
2016-03-10T21:04:43 <colinclark> Since I don\'t know what degree of tagging Google Docs supports for exported PDFs.
2016-03-10T21:04:49 <colinclark> ok, I\'ll do that
2016-03-10T21:05:05 <Bosmon7> awesome, cheers
2016-03-10T21:05:10 <Bosmon7> It\'s a really excellent document, by the way
2016-03-10T21:05:54 <colinclark> oh thanks
2016-03-10T21:06:00 <colinclark> you wrote a good chunk of it :)
2016-03-10T21:06:21 <Bosmon7> Not the best chunk : P

2016-03-10T22:38:37 <danayo> akshay_ thanks for all your work
2016-03-10T22:39:13 <danayo> you seem to be on the right track about making preference selection into a game (your step 2 and step 3)
2016-03-10T22:39:29 <danayo> one question Justin_o and I had was about licensing of the graphics
2016-03-10T22:39:35 <danayo> could you please indicate this more clearly?
2016-03-10T22:40:03 <danayo> next step will be to submit your proposal according to the template
2016-03-10T22:40:13 <danayo> and we\'ll consider it along with all you\'ve provided so far
2016-03-10T22:40:18 <danayo> akshay_
2016-03-10T22:40:52 <danayo> the template here: https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/5729245854695424/
2016-03-10T22:41:09 <akshay_> thanks for the reply @danayo
2016-03-10T22:43:47 <akshay_> I suppose that this being an open source project we can use graphics with free licenses like the ones available here : http://opengameart.org/
2016-03-10T22:45:19 <danayo> I suppose so akshay_
2016-03-10T22:46:02 <akshay_> so the game arts that I have used in the mockups are most from this site and I have read their license agreements
2016-03-10T22:46:45 <akshay_> and all of them states we can use them for open source projects
2016-03-10T22:49:29 <akshay_> And there are a few which I bought from the unity store some time back when I started making games using unity.
2016-03-10T22:50:48 <akshay_> And those game arts again  had a licensing which stated that they could be used for any purpose (commercial/open source), just we can\'t
2016-03-10T22:51:11 <akshay_> redistribute those individual game art files.
2016-03-10T22:52:04 <akshay_> So we can use all the graphics that I have used in the UI mockups in the actual project.

2016-03-10T14:37:43 <arshad_> Well , the  project is pretty straight forward
2016-03-10T14:39:35 <arshad_> We have to implement UIO for all different sizes of screens
2016-03-10T14:39:59 <arshad_> Is this whole summer project
2016-03-10T14:41:17 <himank> sir, can we use other methods also to acheive responsiveness or just media queries?
2016-03-10T14:43:58 <arshad_> I am going to start working on it asap

2016-03-10T14:55:12 <Justin_o> unfortunately the mentor for this project is sick today and off next week. I\'ll try to answer any questions you have.
2016-03-10T14:55:36 <Justin_o> but you\'ll probably want to work with the mentor on coming up with an appropriate design as well
2016-03-10T14:56:12 <kasparnet> ping avtar
2016-03-10T14:56:48 <Justin_o> arshad_: i\'d also suggest, as a starting point, to being to get familiar with the tool and what it does, as well as the Infusion framework that we use.
2016-03-10T14:59:51 <arshad_> Ok! I have forked the fusion infusion repo and will soon update to

2016-03-10T15:03:35 <Awesome_A> Can we use bootstrap for the responsiveness of the UIoptions?

2016-03-10T15:04:13 <Justin_o> akshay: thanks.. i saw you posted that yesterday... i\'ll try to take a look at that today

2016-03-10T15:05:18 <Justin_o> Awesome_A: i\'d probably suggest using foundation as that\'s what we use in other parts of the framework. Even better if you don\'t use any framework at all, to increase compatibility with other systems.
2016-03-10T15:05:42 <akshay> after doing with the UI mockups. I\'m coding the various modules up show that I can show up a demo working part.
2016-03-10T15:06:22 <akshay> it would be good If I could get the feedback on the gameplay and UI mockups.
2016-03-10T15:06:53 <Awesome_A> ok great

2016-03-10T15:12:16 <Justin_o> akshay: okay, i\'ll try to look it over
2016-03-10T15:13:04 <Justin_o> Awesome_A: probably a good place to start.. and you can talk it over in more detail with jhung when he\'s back
2016-03-10T15:14:29 <nrda> @cindyli this is regarding the use of global variable in the pull request of the issue FLUID-5737, what is happening is that when a file is completely uploaded then its size is added to \'batch.totalBytesUploaded\' and \'that.queue.sizeOfUploadedFiles()\', hence it is added twice.
2016-03-10T15:14:44 <Awesome_A> yes we started the conversion already. We will go deep into the project by the time he comes back
2016-03-10T15:17:51 <nrda> So i use a global variable \'previoussizeOfUploadedFiles\' to track when a file gets completely uploaded, and then when i detect that a file is completely uploaded then i changed the value of \'batch.totalBytesUploaded\' to zero. So if i reduce the scope of that variable into that function then it will get intialised every time i call the function, but i required that value to stay untill  the next time the function is called
2016-03-10T15:18:07 <Justin_o> Awesome_A: ah great

2016-03-10T15:56:45 <cindyli> nrda: sorry, was busy on a call. i see you point of having "previoussizeOfUploadedFiles" as a global variable. in that case the better approach is to use a component member option to track it. digging an example
2016-03-10T16:03:22 <cindyli> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/components/uploader/js/Uploader.js#L427
2016-03-10T16:04:53 <cindyli> nrda: with infusion, component options are normally used as the component API, while member options are used to track internal changes within the component

2016-03-10T16:10:17 <cindyli> nrda: can you also reply my pull request comment about your reason of this solution
2016-03-10T16:10:48 <cindyli> nrda: i\'m also not sure if updateTotalProgress() is the right place to manipulate batch.totalBytesUploaded
2016-03-10T16:13:08 <cindyli> nrda: add code comment for blocks that do special handling of some issues but not so obvious for other ppl to realize what issues they work around
2016-03-10T16:19:58 <nrda> cindyli: I am just trying to clear the value of batch.totalBytesUploaded when it gets uploaded, earlier it was clearing after the value is added to UploadingSize.
2016-03-10T16:21:45 <nrda> cindyli: \'it gets uploaded\'  means the file gets uploaded
2016-03-10T16:23:31 <cindyli> ok, nrda. as the function name updateTotalProgress indicates, this function is meant to update the progress. i\'m thinking clearing the value of batch.totalBytesUploaded probably should happen when the file is finished uploading.
2016-03-10T16:26:12 <nrda> yes, that is when the value is to be cleared
