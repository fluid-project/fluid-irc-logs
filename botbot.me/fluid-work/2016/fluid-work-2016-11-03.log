2016-11-03T17:43:20 <cindyli> ok
2016-11-03T17:43:31 <simonjb> thanks Bosmon for adding notes :)
2016-11-03T17:43:54 <gtirloni> cindyli: you can add that piece of code anywhere before the last \'end\' in the Vagrantfile
2016-11-03T17:44:16 <cindyli> cool
2016-11-03T17:49:02 <gtirloni> cindyli: i\'m taking the rest of the day off today.. feel free to add your comments to the that PR, ok? i tested the changes here one can\'t never be 100% sure.. i really appreciate all the help with the tests.
2016-11-03T17:49:17 <gtirloni> *but one
2016-11-03T17:49:28 <cindyli> sure. thanks, gtirloni

2016-11-03T18:10:56 <simonjb> Bosmon: am I right in thinking that we don\'t have anything detailed written yet about the "co-occurrence engine"? I\'m thinking that\'s what I will do after tomorrow\'s meeting: write up details about discovery and the co-occurrence engine to plan the work
2016-11-03T18:11:59 * cindyli1 joined the channel
2016-11-03T18:12:02 <simonjb> is the co-occurrence engine part of what you have been recently working on or is it focused on ui?
2016-11-03T18:12:21 <simonjb> that is, has your recent work been focused on ui
2016-11-03T18:13:18 <Bosmon> simonjb - right... I think the only place anything might have been written about it is in the pads for any previous meetings
2016-11-03T18:13:48 <simonjb> Bosmon: good, I wanted to make sure that I hadn\'t missed something very important :)

2016-11-03T18:21:27 <Bosmon> And only "notionally" connected with the Nexus since so far I am just working against a local component tree in a browser
2016-11-03T18:21:27 <Bosmon> I have quite enough problems to be going along with : P

2016-11-03T19:40:18 <cindyli> yay!
2016-11-03T19:41:04 <Justin_o> cindyli: did you manually retrigger the build, or did it get triggered from a merge?
2016-11-03T19:41:48 <cindyli> Justin_o: do you mean to update the build site? i didn\'t do anything
2016-11-03T19:42:03 <cindyli> probably triggered by a merge of a pull reqeust?
2016-11-03T19:42:29 <Justin_o> cindyli: okay... it seems we\'re on the third build now, so maybe it tried to rebuild itself after the failure
2016-11-03T19:42:44 <Justin_o> did you merge in the test fix as well?
2016-11-03T19:43:04 <cindyli> yes, Justin_o, i think that\'s where the third build came from
2016-11-03T19:43:52 <Justin_o> cindyli: okay, so hopefully this time it\'ll work :)

2016-11-03T15:30:13 <stegru> i don\'t think i\'ve seen that
2016-11-03T15:30:44 <stegru> it might mean the wrong version of ms build tools is installed?
2016-11-03T15:31:41 <stegru> MSB4132 was the thing to google... https://github.com/chjj/pty.js/issues/60
2016-11-03T15:31:59 <stegru> the solution was to install visual studio
2016-11-03T15:32:40 <stegru> i don\'t agree with that
2016-11-03T15:35:32 <kasparnet> stegru: ok, cheers - I\'ll might try that, or just rebuild my VM to avoid dealing with other stuff I might have screwed up :D
2016-11-03T15:35:44 <stegru> is this a different version of gyp than usual?
2016-11-03T15:36:56 <kasparnet> not that I know of ... it was working, then I updated to the latest version of windows

2016-11-03T17:38:56 <simonjb> Bosmon: I\'ll take a look at the pulls
2016-11-03T17:40:50 <cindyli> gtirloni: thanks for figuring out the node_modules/ binding issue. I wonder if I can test the new approach. does the change on Vagrantfile need to be done at the remote vagrant file? wonder if I make that change locally?

2016-11-03T17:41:13 <Bosmon> simonjb, colinclark - thanks for the awesome pre-meeting notes for our NECKSUS meeting tomorrow
