2016-06-08T18:56:31 <cindyli> avtar: with gpii wiki, do you know if it\'s possible to attach files on a wiki page? i was looking around with editing page but didn\'t find this feature
2016-06-08T18:58:21 <avtar> cindyli: has the file been uploaded already?
2016-06-08T18:59:27 <cindyli> no, avtar
2016-06-08T18:59:47 <cindyli> those files are binary files, not images
2016-06-08T19:00:22 <cindyli> they are the source files for images used on that page, would be nice to attach them on the same page so other ppl can modify if needed, avtar
2016-06-08T19:01:03 <cindyli> let me know if u have other ideas to handle this situation, avtar
2016-06-08T19:03:11 <avtar> cindyli: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Linking_to_files the example covers jpg files but should apply to other formats as well

2016-06-08T19:06:30 <cindyli> avtar: that\'s the way I added images onto the wiki page. as u know, those image files are not modifiable as they are fixed and exported from an editable binary file, in my case are .giraffe files. I\'d like to attach .giraffe files on the same page, such as children of that page so that they are downloadable and modifiable for other ppl

2016-06-08T19:39:38 <gtirloni> can you edit this .giraffe file in a text editor? maybe you could copy/paste its contents into the page
2016-06-08T19:39:46 <cindyli> gtirloni: i was hoping to add links on the page that would trigger the download of the source file.
2016-06-08T19:40:17 <cindyli> but failed at uploading .giraffle file, get this error - File extension ".graffle" does not match the detected MIME type of the file (application/x-gzip).
2016-06-08T19:40:33 <cindyli> :(
2016-06-08T19:40:49 <gtirloni> what\'s this file format? images? do you need a special app for it?

2016-06-08T19:48:23 <gtirloni> ok. i think either nginx (web server) or mediawiki needs to be taught about .graffle and the MIME type it should use...
2016-06-08T19:48:35 <gtirloni> the git repo looks like a good idea :)

2016-06-08T14:15:28 <Justin_o> jhung: for the electron status in the JT sim, do we want the status to be empty to start and only have content after we start adding electrons
2016-06-08T14:16:30 <jhung> Justin_o: good question. I can make an argument either way. If I had to choose I\'d say it should have content initially so the layout is predictable.
2016-06-08T14:17:05 <Justin_o> jhung: that\'s what i was thinking too. However, the downside is that it gets read out on page load
2016-06-08T14:17:20 <Justin_o> because the status area is static, but the content is always dynamic.
2016-06-08T14:19:37 <jhung> Justin_o: Ah. It could cause confusion.
2016-06-08T14:20:59 <Justin_o> jhung: yes, that\'s true
2016-06-08T14:21:19 <Justin_o> jhung: so maybe i\'ll just add it after the electrons start accruing
2016-06-08T14:22:04 <jhung> Justin_o: yeah, but I wonder if users will know it\'s there and what happened?
2016-06-08T14:22:22 <Justin_o> jhung: it will get announced
2016-06-08T14:22:35 <Justin_o> or you mean the status area at all?
2016-06-08T14:25:22 <jhung> yes Justin_o. I wonder if users will know that there was a status area added to the document structure and that they can navigate to it whenever they want. This seemed to be pretty important in our testing.
2016-06-08T14:25:47 <Justin_o> jhung: the status area will be there statically, it will just be empty
