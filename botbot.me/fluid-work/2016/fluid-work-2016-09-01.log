b'2016-09-01T15:30:47 <cindyli> i have this code for resetting pouchdb used by the auth server to initial state - https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/GPII-1821/gpii/node_modules/pouchManager/src/pouchManager.js#L57-L64
2016-09-01T15:31:17 <Bosmon7> cindyli - I can\'t think how you determined that this variable is not used or not set?
2016-09-01T15:31:29 <Bosmon7> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/tests/component-tests/uploader/js/FileQueueTests.js#L315
2016-09-01T15:31:34 <bens___> gloob, you\'re on a mac right? do you have a bash shell?
2016-09-01T15:32:04 <cindyli> Bosmon7: the calculation of numReadyFiles has been removed in Justin_o\'s pull request
2016-09-01T15:32:24 <Bosmon7> I see
2016-09-01T15:32:34 <cindyli> right, i should actually not using master for that line
2016-09-01T15:32:41 <cindyli> should have used justin\'s branch
2016-09-01T15:32:54 <cindyli> anyway, continue the chain problem, Bosmon7
2016-09-01T15:33:13 <Bosmon7> cindyli, the-t-in-rtf - for this "load data on startup business", I think the idea needs to be reconceived a bit
2016-09-01T15:33:29 <Bosmon7> If there\'s some data that needs to be loaded on startup, we should just ensure to always load it on startup if it is not already there
2016-09-01T15:33:52 <Bosmon7> Or indeed, "ensure that the data is there after startup" I think is a more accurate way of descibing this requirement
2016-09-01T15:35:15 <cindyli> Bosmon7: i think that is how gpii.express.pouch is currently implemented with, correct me if i\'m wrong, the-t-in-rtf
2016-09-01T15:36:52 <Bosmon7> cindyli, Justin_o - I\'m really confused by https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/744/files
2016-09-01T15:36:53 <cindyli> Bosmon: back to the chain: from the code above in pouchManager, the chain is, 1. when the reset request is received, it calls expressPouch.cleanup.
2016-09-01T15:37:09 <Bosmon7> it appears that we are actually removing functionality from the Uploader, rather than just backward compatibility material
2016-09-01T15:37:36 <cindyli> 2. at onCleanupComplete, destroy expressPouch
2016-09-01T15:38:02 <cindyli> 3. at afterDestroy of expressPouch, call the createOnEvent to recreate expressPouch
2016-09-01T15:38:12 <Bosmon7> cindyli - right
2016-09-01T15:38:18 <cindyli> 4. at onStarted of expressPouch, send back the success response
2016-09-01T15:38:52 <cindyli> i have a few questions with this chain
2016-09-01T15:39:43 <cindyli> 1. the code to send back the success response has problem with line 62
2016-09-01T15:39:50 <cindyli> {gpii.pouchManager.reset.handler} is unrecognized in the context
2016-09-01T15:40:14 <gloob> bens___: yes
2016-09-01T15:41:08 <cindyli> i guess it\'s a reasonable error since "gpii.pouchManager.reset.handler" is hooked up with handlerGrade option which I\'m not sure where it\'s located on the component tree or maybe it\'s not on the tree at all but as an option value
2016-09-01T15:41:28 <cindyli> so how can i send back the response in this case
2016-09-01T15:42:14 <cindyli> the 2nd question is related to the first one
2016-09-01T15:42:16 <Bosmon7> cindyli - yes, obviously the handler for this particular request isn\'t in scope on expressPouch
2016-09-01T15:42:28 <Bosmon7> How could it be
2016-09-01T15:42:41 <cindyli> 2. is it possible to use promise chain rather than chained events?
2016-09-01T15:42:42 <Bosmon7> All this material needs to go onto the request
2016-09-01T15:42:52 <Bosmon7> Only the request knows which request it is
2016-09-01T15:42:58 <cindyli> ah ok
2016-09-01T15:43:02 <Bosmon7> Or the "handler" in the-t-in-rtf \'s terminology
2016-09-01T15:43:18 <Bosmon7> The longer scoped component must always be injected into the shorter scoped component
2016-09-01T15:43:55 <cindyli> Bosmon7: do you mean to inject all those events into "gpii.pouchManager.reset.handler"
2016-09-01T15:44:43 <cindyli> would that be the same issue since the request handler and pouchExpress are not in the same scope and don\'t see each other
2016-09-01T15:44:57 * alanharnum joined the channel
2016-09-01T15:47:30 <Bosmon7> If the handler can\'t see pouchExpress, this could never have worked at all
2016-09-01T15:47:37 <cindyli> right
2016-09-01T15:55:18 * alanharnum has quit
2016-09-01T15:55:23 <cindyli> Bosmon7: before creating a separate express server for reset, i started with adding the /reset request handler to the express server that has expressPouch. but underlying pouchExpress was aggressive enough that it takes all the requests to root, meaning looking up a database with that name
2016-09-01T15:55:41 <cindyli> so, i decided to try with a separate express server
2016-09-01T15:56:22 <Bosmon7> the-t-in-rtf - can you consider cindyli\'s report?
2016-09-01T15:56:40 <Bosmon7> What could be represented by "pouchExpress was aggressive enough that it takes all the requests to root"?
2016-09-01T15:56:54 <Bosmon7> Will this be a phenomenon caused by express-pouchdb itself?
2016-09-01T15:57:36 <Bosmon7> It\'s really problematic if we can\'t use an express server which has pouchExpress mounted in it for any other purpose
2016-09-01T15:58:43 * kavya has quit
2016-09-01T15:59:45 <cindyli> ok, seems i need to go back to the initial approach, will look up approaches to work around this agression
2016-09-01T16:00:08 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: I replied to your comments on the FLUID-5370 PR
2016-09-01T16:00:15 <avtar> bens___, gloob, gtirloni: vagrant winrm -c "do.ps1 -c \'type listeners\\libcurl\\include\\libcurl\\curl.h\'"
2016-09-01T16:00:18 <avtar> so far so good
2016-09-01T16:02:38 <Bosmon7> cindyli perhaps it needs to be mounted in a "router" at a lower level of the express app
2016-09-01T16:02:52 <Bosmon7> This is something the-t-in-rtf could perhaps help with
2016-09-01T16:03:26 <bens___> avtar, how about exit codes?
2016-09-01T16:03:38 <cindyli> Bosmon: u mean to mount a router on the express app where pouchExpress is mounted?
2016-09-01T16:03:41 <cindyli> i could try that too
2016-09-01T16:04:07 <bens___> avtar, using vagrant winrm -c "do.ps1 -c \'exit 127\'" i get exit code of 0 from vagrant (checking $?)
2016-09-01T16:08:30 <avtar> bens___: i\'ve been checking exit codes of the gpii test scripts and other commands i\'ve run, like installing third party software, and so far i\'m seeing expected results
2016-09-01T16:08:39 <avtar> i\'ll try that as well
2016-09-01T16:09:10 <bens___> done any negative tests/

2016-09-01T16:53:56 <the-t-in-rtf> I will shortly start working Fridays as well, which should make it a little easier to coordinate.
2016-09-01T16:54:17 <cindyli> thanks, the-t-in-rtf, enjoy the weekend
2016-09-01T16:54:36 <the-t-in-rtf> you too
2016-09-01T16:54:37 <cindyli> btw, Monday is a public holiday in canada, the-t-in-rtf, shall we move the meeting to another day
2016-09-01T16:54:59 <the-t-in-rtf> Let\'s skip this week, next week is honestly kind of crazy.
2016-09-01T16:55:17 <the-t-in-rtf> skip a week, I mean.
2016-09-01T16:55:22 <cindyli> ok, the-t-in-rtf.
2016-09-01T16:55:43 <the-t-in-rtf> Sorry, I really look forward to them usually, just bad timing next week.

2016-09-01T21:38:18 <avtar> btw we\'ll probably release that box on atlas next tuesday
2016-09-01T21:38:33 <avtar> but so far it\'s looking pretty good

2016-09-01T21:40:31 <bens___> hmm avtar are you on linux or windows desktop?
2016-09-01T21:40:47 <avtar> windows desktop
2016-09-01T21:40:49 <bens___> cause i am linux, i think gloob is mac... did we cover windows?
2016-09-01T21:40:55 <bens___> oh good
2016-09-01T21:41:04 <avtar> ah i didn\'t know you were using linux
2016-09-01T21:41:13 <avtar> in that case, yes, all bases are covered
2016-09-01T21:41:31 <bens___> yep i am red hat 7.2... on the desktop
2016-09-01T21:41:53 <avtar> you mean rhel 7.2?
2016-09-01T21:41:59 <bens___> yes
2016-09-01T21:42:01 <avtar> ok
2016-09-01T21:43:18 <avtar> looks like simonjb discovered the powershell subcommand is only available on windows hosts :/

b'2016-09-01T00:00:25 <avtar> bens___, gloob: i tried doitclient.exe wcmd refreshenv & "%*" but that won\'t be reliable
2016-09-01T00:00:44 <avtar> if you do \'vagrant reload\' and then:

2016-09-01T00:01:44 <avtar> that results in great success
2016-09-01T00:06:21 <avtar> also, the following works if you want to avoid restarting windows

2016-09-01T15:01:42 <Bosmon7> Hi cindyli - still not clear on your meaning of "unused tokens"
2016-09-01T15:02:25 <cindyli> Bosmon7: did u see that in comments for Justin_o\'s infusion pull request?
2016-09-01T15:02:34 <Bosmon7> Yes
2016-09-01T15:02:55 <cindyli> means the tokens that should be removed in 2.0 since we no longer maintain the backwards compatibility with 1.5, Bosmon7
2016-09-01T15:03:21 <cindyli> "unused variables" should be more proper
2016-09-01T15:03:41 <cindyli> but as that term is already used in JIRA...
2016-09-01T15:05:33 <bens___> hi avtar, gtirloni, does the box 0.4.3 version have the new do.ps1 included in it?
2016-09-01T15:06:12 <avtar> hey bens___ 0.4.3 does
2016-09-01T15:06:22 * alanharnum has quit
2016-09-01T15:06:47 <avtar> 0.4.4 will be uploaded today which will be the last version until 3 months from now
2016-09-01T15:07:12 <avtar> that will just silence refreshenv otherwise the behaviour will be the same as 0.4.3
2016-09-01T15:08:57 <bens___> avtar, uploaded to the cdn or atlas?
2016-09-01T15:09:02 <Justin_o> Bosmon: in regards to backwards compatibility and deprecation, i\'m thinking about filing a JIRA to remove all of those things for the Infusion 2.0 release... could also be a good time to remove any old browser hacks if you know of any
2016-09-01T15:09:15 <avtar> bens___: both
2016-09-01T15:12:45 <gloob> avtar: the box is working for me, thinking about a very verbose and intesive process, although our unit tests are
2016-09-01T15:12:48 <gloob> by the way
2016-09-01T15:13:27 <gloob> stegru: I noticed a slow down in the windows tests, is it my system or new tests you added?
2016-09-01T15:13:31 <gloob> anyone noticed it?
2016-09-01T15:13:44 <gloob> would be good to add some kind of basic profiling I guess
2016-09-01T15:14:04 <stegru> it could be the new tests, yes
2016-09-01T15:14:48 <stegru> however, the fix i made for the high-contrast bug will slow it down, because it now waits for the setting to be applied
2016-09-01T15:19:38 <stegru> gloob: yes, I\'ve just looked it the new tests and they should not take long (if they\'re passing)
2016-09-01T15:24:00 <Bosmon7> cindyli - that takes care of the "tokens" part - how about "unused"? : P
2016-09-01T15:24:06 <Bosmon7> The variable you linked to appeared to be used
2016-09-01T15:24:07 * alanharnum joined the channel
2016-09-01T15:25:24 <bens___> gloob, stegru, i\'ve just run them about 15 times in a row. getting runtimes of about 7 seconds +/- 300ms
2016-09-01T15:25:33 <cindyli> Bosmon7: that variable is used in tests but is no longer calculated/generated in the uploader source code. i might get it wrong?
2016-09-01T15:26:23 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - we could consider getting rid of code like this - https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/components/inlineEdit/js/InlineEdit.js#L33
2016-09-01T15:26:40 <Bosmon7> But I\'m not particularly happy about the burden of this until we have some automated webdriver tests of the kind that the-t-in-rtf \'s work will enable
2016-09-01T15:27:02 <Bosmon7> There\'s all kinds of funny "user-level" hacks in our components that its unclear that they do anything any more
2016-09-01T15:27:07 <Bosmon7> Although this function probably has to be the worst
2016-09-01T15:27:21 <Bosmon7> If we had webdriver tests for InlineEdit we could have a massive purge without a massive QA effort
2016-09-01T15:27:34 <Bosmon7> the-t-in-rtf - any story on webdriver from IE11 or edge?
2016-09-01T15:30:09 * kasparne_ has quit
2016-09-01T15:30:22 <cindyli> Bosmon7, the-t-in-rtf, need ur help with some chained events issue and how to send back the response when the chain completes
