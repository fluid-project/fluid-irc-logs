2016-04-15T16:55:53 <gtirloni> couchbase has some free courses on nosql concepts.. i\'ve just received a notification they\'ve released another one on data modeling with json (http://training.couchbase.com/online). sharing in case anyone might be interested. i can\'t vouch for its quality though.
2016-04-15T17:00:34 <dsharma> Bosmon why linux not windows

2016-04-15T17:11:31 <cindyli1> dsharma: Bosmon is using the linux repo as an example since there has been a pull request issued there. if you are working on windows, your pull request should be issued against Bosmon\'s gpii windows repo - https://github.com/amb26/windows/tree/GPII-1318
2016-04-15T17:17:09 <cindyli> Bosmon: for adding couchdb support for the auth server, i was looking into the preference server configuration to understand how gpii communicates with couchdb, seems it\'s using "kettle.dataSource.URL" as the base component type then passing in "gradeNames": "kettle.dataSource.CouchDB" in the configuration

2016-04-15T12:56:24 <kasparne_> Bosmon8: Hey bossman! I realized inRange and quantize part of GPII universal and not part of the model transformation framework -- they seem pretty general purpose, so thinking I should move them over.. agree?
2016-04-15T12:59:17 <cindyli> Bosmon: ^
2016-04-15T12:59:55 <Bosmon> kasparne_ - absolutely and definitely
2016-04-15T13:00:01 <Bosmon> Don\'t we even have a JIRA for that already?
2016-04-15T13:00:33 * kasparne_ is looking
2016-04-15T13:01:04 <cindyli> Bosmon, Bosmon8, Tony isn\'t online but you probably can answer my question too, it\'s about the use of "_users" table in couchDB for saving signed up users. the more i read about _users, the more i feel it\'s for storing database users instead of application users
2016-04-15T13:01:32 <cindyli> wonder what\'s the intention of storing gpii users into a global _users table
2016-04-15T13:02:06 <Bosmon> cindyli - simply compatibility
2016-04-15T13:02:16 <Bosmon> It\'s perhaps unclear we need this compatibility for much any more
2016-04-15T13:02:45 <Bosmon> But whilst developing this library, Tony was trying to ensure that it was compatible in storage with another user management library that was available in npm
2016-04-15T13:02:56 <cindyli> the problem i can see with storing application data into _users is that how do we split it out of all own data from the mix of db users?
2016-04-15T13:03:23 <Bosmon> cindyli - hopefully Tony\'s library is flexible enough that it can store into a database with an arbitrary name
2016-04-15T13:03:29 <Bosmon> In fact, I am quite confident that it is
2016-04-15T13:04:16 <cindyli> Bosmon: u mean to store user information into the application database with a type of "user", instead of using the global _users?
2016-04-15T13:04:27 <Bosmon> cindyli - yes, that\'s correct
2016-04-15T13:04:38 <cindyli> ok, that would great
2016-04-15T13:04:48 <Bosmon> This was part of the application requirements that we wrote up in the wiki
2016-04-15T13:04:57 <Bosmon> That the solution is capable of sharing a CouchDB database with another application
2016-04-15T13:05:27 <cindyli> i\'m migrating the "in memory" data to couchDB, will store users into application specific database
2016-04-15T13:07:38 <Bosmon> cindyli - presumably we want them in the same database, to ensure that we can do "joins" on them in future
2016-04-15T13:07:56 <cindyli> Bosmon: yes
2016-04-15T13:08:12 <cindyli> using the same database also helps with data import/export
2016-04-15T13:12:06 <kasparne_> Bosmon: wasn\'t able to find any JRIAs but created one: https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5890
2016-04-15T13:13:05 <Bosmon> kasparne_ - you are generally awesome
2016-04-15T13:13:17 <Bosmon> I\'m beginning to wonder whether you shouldn\'t be destroyed after all
2016-04-15T13:13:30 <kasparne_> haha - wow - that\'s pretty big
2016-04-15T13:19:12 <gloob> but there\'s some beauty in destruction too
2016-04-15T13:19:47 <gloob> after the singularity point reached by kasparnet we all will be doomed

2016-04-15T13:28:48 <Katy_> Bosmon cindyli   Have you considered using the per-user database feature?  I\'ve heard about it and haven\'t used it.   https://cloudant.com/blog/replication-with-cloudant-pt-3/#.VxDqq0arZOM
2016-04-15T13:32:10 <Bosmon> Katy_ - seems complex!
2016-04-15T13:32:14 <Bosmon> I wonder what the benefit of it is :)
2016-04-15T13:33:59 <Katy_> Bosmon   Secures the data per user is the benefit.  Maybe too complex for our need but might be interesting to look at.  https://github.com/colinskow/superlogin
2016-04-15T13:34:38 <Bosmon> Thanks for the link, Katy_
2016-04-15T13:36:35 <Bosmon> I\'m imagining that since we are not planning to expose the CouchDB port to the public internet, we can avoid a lot of this DB-level security
2016-04-15T13:36:49 <Bosmon> And that simply applying the database credentials within the cloud will give us what we need
2016-04-15T13:37:10 <Bosmon> But we certainly need to draw up a formal threat and penetration analysis of our deployment so that we understand exactly what threats we are defending against
2016-04-15T13:37:35 <Bosmon> This link from "superlogin" is interesting and useful: http://blog.mattwoodward.com/2012/03/definitive-guide-to-couchdb.html

2016-04-15T14:04:01 <Katy_> Bosman Even though a database is not exposed to the public internet, it can still be injected by a malicious attack pretending to be a user.  A benefit of a user per database concept, makes it more difficult for an attack to grab all the users.  Agree we need to protect the gpii data  with a formal analysis.

2016-04-15T16:18:03 * avtar joined the channel
2016-04-15T16:18:33 <Bosmon> In this case this would be https://github.com/amb26/windows/tree/GPII-1318
2016-04-15T16:18:42 <Bosmon> You can see an example of this happening in the linux repostory here:
2016-04-15T16:18:53 <Bosmon> https://github.com/amb26/linux/tree/GPII-1318
2016-04-15T16:19:08 <Bosmon> You can see that this branch itself has a pull request against it which has been issued by jhernandez and clown
2016-04-15T16:19:23 <Bosmon> Which is this one: https://github.com/amb26/linux/pull/2
2016-04-15T16:19:49 <Bosmon> The pull request then goes through review in the normal way, but we just note during the upstream process that the content has been reviewed once already and that it can be passed more quickly
