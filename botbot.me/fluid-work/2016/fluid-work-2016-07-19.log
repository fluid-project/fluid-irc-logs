2016-07-19T13:02:42 <colinclark> should we just use vidyo instead?
2016-07-19T13:02:51 <the-t-in-rtf> I have the creds and am opening the room now.

2016-07-19T13:55:26 <Bosmon> avtar - the little green "TICKS" on the pull requests are extremely cool
2016-07-19T13:56:10 <avtar> Bosmon: agreed :)
2016-07-19T13:56:19 <jhung> fluid-everyone: for today\'s design crit we will be looking at some updated mockups for the IDRC website, as well as typography and colours. Join us in the fluid-standup Vidyo room in 5 minutes if you\'re interested.

2016-07-19T18:00:49 <DinukaDeSilva> Hi colinclark , sepidehshahi ...... thanks for your comments about the slider
2016-07-19T18:01:07 <colinclark> Hey DinukaDeSilva, I\'m glad they were helpful
2016-07-19T18:01:46 <sepidehshahi> hope they were helpful DinukaDeSilva
2016-07-19T18:02:10 <DinukaDeSilva> actually showing values as a ruler is needed
2016-07-19T18:02:30 <DinukaDeSilva> but, I think we need to come up with a better design for that
2016-07-19T18:03:09 <DinukaDeSilva> I mean, for a horizontal slider, .... I think it would be not that much practical
2016-07-19T18:03:11 <DinukaDeSilva> http://dinukadesilva.github.io/music-ctrls/demo/linear-slider.html
2016-07-19T18:03:24 <DinukaDeSilva> here is what I just started
2016-07-19T18:04:15 <colinclark> It seems to me that vertical sliders are probably more crucial for music applications to start with, DinukaDeSilva
2016-07-19T18:05:26 <DinukaDeSilva> you mean that we need to give the priority to vertical sliders first
2016-07-19T18:05:58 <jhung> TPark, godfrey_: I don\'t think I\'m going to have time until later this week to take a look at the work you\'ve done re: Assistive Technologies. Maybe this Thursday or Friday.
2016-07-19T18:06:36 <colinclark> DinukaDeSilva: Personally, I would, yes
2016-07-19T18:06:53 <colinclark> but of course that\'s a question that you and simon and sepideh should decide on
2016-07-19T18:07:23 <TPark> jhung: That\'s fine with us. thanks

2016-07-19T19:47:46 <DinukaDeSilva> colinclark: I just added a UI mockup for the vertical slider
2016-07-19T19:47:56 <colinclark> cool!
2016-07-19T19:47:59 <colinclark> it looked pretty good!
2016-07-19T19:48:11 <DinukaDeSilva> ah....
2016-07-19T19:48:51 <DinukaDeSilva> I have a small concern about the way how we should divide notches
2016-07-19T19:49:21 <DinukaDeSilva> I mean, for sliders, we have given the feasibility of changing min, max and the tickValue
2016-07-19T19:50:33 <DinukaDeSilva> if we divide notches based on any of them, there will be decimal values for notches
2016-07-19T19:51:15 <DinukaDeSilva> So, eaither we should format the label of notches to a certain length
2016-07-19T19:51:36 <DinukaDeSilva> or should think of another way to divide notches
