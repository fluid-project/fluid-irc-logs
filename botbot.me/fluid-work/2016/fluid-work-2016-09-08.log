2016-09-08T18:03:24 <Justin_o> gtirloni: yes, some of those tests require focus so when i run the all-tests.. i take a few minutes to think or stair out the window
2016-09-08T18:04:57 <gtirloni> make sense, good approach. the good thing is that when they run inside the VM, the browser has focus (even if the VM window is not on focus)
2016-09-08T18:05:19 <Justin_o> gtirloni: yah, that is really convenient
2016-09-08T18:05:48 <Justin_o> gtirloni, avtar: by the way on my 10 runs i had failures on 3, 5, 8, and 9
2016-09-08T18:07:31 <gtirloni> i\'m running a bunch of tests here with some settings changed to see if i can pinpoint where it starts to break. still downloading the f23 box to test on it too
2016-09-08T18:08:27 <Justin_o> gtirloni: thanks

2016-09-08T19:59:09 <avtar> gtirloni: the infusion test failures with firefox don\'t seem to be fedora related
2016-09-08T20:00:20 <avtar> Justin_o and i ran the tests a few times using firefox 48 on windows 10 with similar results
2016-09-08T20:00:22 <gtirloni> avtar: almost finished here but i guess the breakage started on ff46
2016-09-08T20:00:39 <gtirloni> good results with ff45 and ff44
2016-09-08T20:01:13 <gtirloni> f23 comes with ff41 so that might explain it
2016-09-08T20:04:10 <Justin_o> gtirloni, avtar: interesting.. i wonder if we should fix the issue before upgrading to fedora 24, or it is useful to see the breakage.. i wonder what caused it in the newer firefox though

2016-09-08T20:12:00 <michelled> danayo, colinclark: are you ready to meet now?
2016-09-08T20:12:46 <colinclark> michelled: I am
2016-09-08T20:12:48 <colinclark> sorry for the delay
2016-09-08T20:12:54 <colinclark> how about you, danayo?
2016-09-08T20:13:04 <danayo> yep
2016-09-08T20:13:58 <michelled> my room?
2016-09-08T20:13:58 <danayo> fluid_standup colinclark michelled?
2016-09-08T20:14:12 <colinclark> sure!
2016-09-08T20:14:52 <michelled> standup is good danayo
2016-09-08T20:21:51 <gtirloni> Justin_o avtar: running all-tests.html manually with FF48.. it consistently fails on "Build Test Suite" -- https://www.pastery.net/sahent/raw/
2016-09-08T20:22:09 <gtirloni> Justin_o avtar: I think FF48 will have to be tackled before we can start using F24
2016-09-08T20:23:25 <gtirloni> (both inside and outside the VM)
2016-09-08T20:25:18 <avtar> gtirloni: Justin_o left for the week
2016-09-08T20:25:26 <gtirloni> and for the "SeparatedPanel Preferences Editor Test Suite", i can\'t replicate the issue manually when running just that test (within and outside the VM)..
2016-09-08T20:25:27 <gtirloni> ah ok
2016-09-08T20:25:37 <avtar> just to confirm, are you serving those tests using a web server?
2016-09-08T20:25:48 <gtirloni> no, i tried locally..
2016-09-08T20:26:20 * alanharnum joined the channel
2016-09-08T20:26:57 <avtar> for best results you\'ll need to access them over http
2016-09-08T20:27:03 <avtar> python3 -m http.server 8081
2016-09-08T20:27:12 <gtirloni> ok, let me try that
2016-09-08T20:27:22 <gtirloni> is that what is does with testem?
2016-09-08T20:27:51 <avtar> yup
2016-09-08T20:28:37 <gtirloni> where should i run python3? tests/ ? that\'s failing for all tests ("global failure: ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined")

2016-09-08T20:33:01 <gtirloni> looks like this one will be tricky
2016-09-08T20:33:16 <gtirloni> manually it works fine (20x), hitting refresh on ff48
2016-09-08T20:35:19 <gtirloni> avtar: do you know of i quick way to retrive the error output like we see on the browser?
2016-09-08T20:35:22 <gtirloni> (from testem)
2016-09-08T20:37:31 <avtar> gtirloni: sorry, was lost in another window
2016-09-08T20:37:35 <avtar> not that i know of
2016-09-08T20:38:41 <gtirloni> np
2016-09-08T20:40:20 <gtirloni> if you run it not in \'ci\' mode and connect to the page, then press enter and immediately switch focus to the browser, you can see where it failed (if it failed)
2016-09-08T20:40:33 <gtirloni> also the console window shows something (not touching it right now until it finishes)
2016-09-08T20:41:36 <gtirloni> awesome, got it to fail
2016-09-08T20:41:58 <gtirloni> i\'ll open a JIRA

2016-09-08T13:41:27 <gtirloni> for reference only: today I learned that the vagrant installer is missing a dependency on the c++ redist x86 package and causes curl.exe to fail (which is used to download new boxes). this happened on a fresh install of a win10 host (not guest). looks like the latest changes to the installer did not fix this. if you\'re on fresh install of windows, you\'ll need to download this: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8328

2016-09-08T14:27:57 <gtirloni> Justin_o: hi, yes
2016-09-08T14:30:17 * michelled joined the channel
2016-09-08T14:30:28 <Justin_o> gtirloni: thanks, i\'ll try to take a look at it shortly
2016-09-08T14:42:31 <Justin_o> gtirloni: how do i verify that it\'s the correct version of fedora running
2016-09-08T14:44:24 <gtirloni> you can run `vagrant ssh -c "cat /etc/fedora-release"`
2016-09-08T14:45:02 <Justin_o> gtirloni: thanks
2016-09-08T14:45:37 <Justin_o> gtirloni: :( still at 23
2016-09-08T14:46:03 <Justin_o> is there something i need to do to make is use 24
2016-09-08T14:46:52 <Justin_o> gtirloni: maybe i had an old vm still around.. i just did a vagrant destroy and will try again
2016-09-08T14:47:28 <gtirloni> you can double check that the Vagrantfile you have is pointing to inclusivedesign/fedora24
2016-09-08T14:59:39 <Justin_o> gtirloni: the vagrant destroy seemed to take care of things.. although the initial vagrant up took a long time
2016-09-08T15:01:11 <gtirloni> cool. yeah, i think that makes sense if the box already existed, vagrant won\'t check if the box source image changed or not.. just starts it up. glad it worked now.
2016-09-08T15:03:17 <Justin_o> gtirloni: have you run the tests with Fedora 24?
2016-09-08T15:03:21 <gtirloni> yep
2016-09-08T15:03:31 <Justin_o> i\'m getting an error with Firefox, but the error seems strange
2016-09-08T15:03:34 <Justin_o> did you get any errors?
2016-09-08T15:03:47 <gtirloni> no errors, it passed clean for me
2016-09-08T15:03:57 <gtirloni> could you upload it somewhere so we can take a look?
2016-09-08T15:04:00 <Justin_o> gtirloni: this is the error i\'m getting
2016-09-08T15:04:08 <gtirloni> for reference, i was using virtualbox 5.0.26 and vagrant 1.8.4

2016-09-08T15:05:14 <gtirloni> hmm interesting

2016-09-08T15:15:49 <Justin_o> avtar: i\'m just using the terminal on mac if that\'s what you mean
2016-09-08T15:16:15 <avtar> Justin_o: yup, what does the following command return: echo $SHELL
2016-09-08T15:16:33 <jhung> cindyli: do you have time to look at the PR I mentioned above because it has some PHP?
2016-09-08T15:16:37 <Justin_o> avtar: bash 3.2
2016-09-08T15:17:05 <cindyli> sure, jhung
2016-09-08T15:17:14 <jhung> thanks cindyli
2016-09-08T15:17:18 <cindyli> np
2016-09-08T15:17:57 <avtar> Justin_o: could you try running these tests a few times? i\'m curious about the results
2016-09-08T15:18:14 <Justin_o> avtar: i tried it a second time just now and same results
2016-09-08T15:18:21 <Justin_o> is there a way i can manually run it in the vm?
2016-09-08T15:18:37 <avtar> something like this will work:   for n in {1..10}; do echo "${n}th run: "; grunt tests | grep SeparatedPanelPrefsEditor; done
2016-09-08T15:18:46 <avtar> from your os x terminal and not in the vm
2016-09-08T15:19:03 * alanharnum joined the channel
2016-09-08T15:24:22 <Justin_o> avtar: actually it worked on the third try already, would you still like me to run it 10 times?
2016-09-08T15:24:35 <avtar> might as well :P

2016-09-08T15:25:37 <alanharnum> blog post on mob programming (I believe colinclark has mentioned it in the past) from the UK GDS: https://gdstechnology.blog.gov.uk/2016/09/08/our-top-12-mob-programming-tips-and-thoughts/
2016-09-08T15:26:50 <Justin_o> alanharnum: i was sort of hoping it would be like a flash mob hack-a-thon where hundreds of random programs meet somewhere

2016-09-08T15:50:25 <michelled> it sounds like the expectation is that we would do the integration
2016-09-08T15:50:37 <michelled> colinclark: you might find that interesting ^
2016-09-08T15:50:58 <colinclark> I think we can do our best to help with integration
2016-09-08T15:51:07 <colinclark> we won\'t probably be able to do much in the way of Drupal programming for them
2016-09-08T15:51:22 <michelled> yes, that makes sense.
2016-09-08T15:51:31 <colinclark> but we can definitely provide simply-embeddable widgets of the sort that alanharnum  and avtar worked on for the quicker integration
2016-09-08T15:51:35 <michelled> also, I suspect there will be an effort at the f2f to complete these integrations
2016-09-08T15:53:04 <Justin_o> gtirloni, avtar: so the science experiment is still running, it\'s completed 5 runs so far, with a failure on the 3 and 5th run

2016-09-08T16:52:06 <gtirloni> looks like all issues are related to browser focus, please ignore if that\'s expect.
