2016-05-16T09:04:17 <jhernandez> Bosmon: bonjour prof
2016-05-16T09:04:25 <jhernandez> you around?
2016-05-16T09:05:59 <jhernandez> I\'ve addressed your last comments in the orca settings handler, but now I\'m having a problem when running the tests
2016-05-16T09:14:54 <jhernandez> this is the refactored code (https://github.com/javihernandez/linux/blob/f62ed1baeea6605a0317535e82d68548f9db81fa/gpii/node_modules/orca/orcaSettingsHandler.js), and here\'s the problem I\'m having when running tests (http://pastebin.com/qPn3pJ97)
2016-05-16T09:18:37 <jhernandez> I\'m not sure what\'s happening here
2016-05-16T09:20:25 <jhernandez> can it be a problem with the promise-based pattern I\'m using or a problem in the framework dealing with promise-based returned get payloads?

2016-05-16T11:24:45 <Bosmon> jhernandez - looks like a problem with the test implementation
2016-05-16T11:28:43 <jhernandez> yeah, I had that feeling, but I wasn\'t completely sure

2016-05-16T14:56:13 <PaliwalSparsh> On the npm\'s page of infusion the description is "Infusion is an application framework for developing flexible stuff with JavaScript.". Why we have not specified anywhere on the page what is "stuff" ?
2016-05-16T14:56:27 <PaliwalSparsh> I am relatively new please bear with me :)
2016-05-16T14:59:31 <Bosmon> PaliwalSparsh - because we do not wish to place bounds on what this "stuff" may be :)
2016-05-16T14:59:47 <Bosmon> For example one might say that it should consist of "applications"
2016-05-16T14:59:53 <Bosmon> Whereas another might say it should consist of "documents"
2016-05-16T15:00:10 <Bosmon> Still another might say that it is "representations", etc.
2016-05-16T15:00:29 <Bosmon> Personally I like to talk about *ACTIVE KNOWLEDGE* :)
2016-05-16T15:00:43 * michelled1 joined the channel
2016-05-16T15:01:34 <PaliwalSparsh> @Bosmon Got it. But when i see it for the first time it is a bit hard to guess about the possibilities.
2016-05-16T15:01:48 <Bosmon> Yes
2016-05-16T15:01:59 * michelled has quit
2016-05-16T15:02:00 <Bosmon> Better to have an accurate uncertainty than a false certainty :)
2016-05-16T15:03:39 <PaliwalSparsh> @Bosmon then I will come back to the same discussion after getting into infusion little bit more :)
2016-05-16T15:03:50 <Bosmon> PaliwalSparsh - awesome :)
2016-05-16T15:04:03 <Bosmon> Did you manage to check out the paper that we posted last week?
2016-05-16T15:04:35 <PaliwalSparsh> The pdf was not opening dont know why
2016-05-16T15:07:00 <PaliwalSparsh> I tried it some times in the afternoon but it was showing pdf is damaged or something
2016-05-16T15:07:10 <PaliwalSparsh> @Bosmon ^
2016-05-16T15:07:53 <PaliwalSparsh> tried it once now also same issue png were opening did not try luck with latex file.
2016-05-16T15:09:57 <Bosmon> PaliwalSparsh - here it is
2016-05-16T15:09:58 <Bosmon> https://github.com/amb26/papers/blob/master/onward-2016/onward-2016.pdf
2016-05-16T15:11:16 <PaliwalSparsh> @Bosmon Thanks this one is fine.
