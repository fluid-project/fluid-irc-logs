2016-12-02T17:04:58 <Justin_o> Bosmon: do we have docs regarding the FluidViewDebugging?
2016-12-02T17:06:15 * alanharnum has quit
2016-12-02T17:07:20 <Bosmon> Justin_o - none
2016-12-02T17:07:44 <Justin_o> Bosmon: could you give me a one line description of what it is?
2016-12-02T17:07:52 <Justin_o> need it for the release notes
2016-12-02T17:11:03 * the-t-in-rtf joined the channel
2016-12-02T17:13:16 <Bosmon> Ok - something like "Including FluidViewDebugging.js on the page of any Infusion application gives you access to the "IoC View Inspector". This is accessed through the small cogwheel icon at the bottom right of the page. Click on this to open a panel which can show the details of any view components and their grades that are attached to DOM nodes in the browser pane. This interface works
2016-12-02T17:13:16 <Bosmon> similarly to the "DOM Inspector" familiar from modern web browsers - first click on the magnifying glass icon to enable the "hover to inspect" mode which shows the details for any DOM node that the mouse cursor is hovering over. Click on the the highlighted node in the DOM to freeze the UI in the panel which gives time to inspect the information in more detail. This is an experimental
2016-12-02T17:13:16 <Bosmon> implementation with an engineer-level UI."

2016-12-02T15:12:33 <colinclark> Justin_o: I think I must be very confused about Github\'s new features
2016-12-02T15:12:57 <colinclark> do you see the review comments I left on the README for Infusion yet, or not?
2016-12-02T15:13:13 <colinclark> I guess I somehow pressed the "start a review" button\xe2\x80\x94is that some kind of batch feature?
2016-12-02T15:13:53 <Justin_o> colinclark: i don\'t see them yet. and yes that feature batches together your comments
2016-12-02T15:13:58 <colinclark> oh man
2016-12-02T15:13:59 <Justin_o> that tripped me up the first time too
2016-12-02T15:14:08 <simonjb> colinclark: I think there\'s a button in top right maybe that does the submit
2016-12-02T15:14:10 <colinclark> I should never press new buttons on Github
2016-12-02T15:14:11 <colinclark> oh well
2016-12-02T15:14:27 <colinclark> I\'ll add a few more comments and press simonjb\'s famous button
2016-12-02T15:16:27 <Justin_o> colinclark: that feature can be pretty handy at times. Sometimes the person starts making changes as you leave comments and it messes up the review interface for example. But i really wish they\'d send a warning or something if it\'s been a day or two and you haven\'t submitted it
2016-12-02T15:16:38 <colinclark> yep, it does look handy
2016-12-02T15:16:57 <colinclark> it\'s just interesting how, with application UIs these days, you can go from expert to neophyte in what seems like a day :)
2016-12-02T15:17:12 <Justin_o> haha
2016-12-02T15:17:14 <Justin_o> yah
2016-12-02T15:17:24 <Justin_o> they do put out blog posts for their new features at least
2016-12-02T15:17:33 <Justin_o> which usually explain how things work to some degree

2016-12-02T16:04:59 <colinclark> yes, I do
2016-12-02T16:06:53 <michelled> thx colinclark!
2016-12-02T16:11:49 <Justin_o> colinclark: sorry, missed your message. Yes if you have time to look at the copyright PR that would be great
2016-12-02T16:12:07 <Justin_o> cindyli: would you be able to look over this PR for a 1.4.1 maintenance release https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/793
2016-12-02T16:12:26 <cindyli> ok, Justin_o
2016-12-02T16:12:31 <Justin_o> once that\'s in I\'ll put the 1.4.1 tag back in place and update the release message on github
2016-12-02T16:12:36 <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks

2016-12-02T16:18:15 <Justin_o> colinclark:  regarding this comment https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/791#discussion_r90666091
2016-12-02T16:18:31 <Justin_o> not all of the documentation has been moved over to the  infusion docs site yet
2016-12-02T16:18:43 <colinclark> oh man
2016-12-02T16:18:45 <colinclark> that sucks
2016-12-02T16:18:51 <Justin_o> colinclark: here\'s an example http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/to-do/PagerAPI.html
2016-12-02T16:18:56 <Justin_o> yes, that sucks ;(
2016-12-02T16:19:22 <colinclark> ok
2016-12-02T16:19:34 <Justin_o> colinclark: we could make that a blocker for 2.0 though
2016-12-02T16:19:38 <colinclark> i wouldn\'t
2016-12-02T16:19:40 <colinclark> let\'s ship it :)
2016-12-02T16:20:13 <colinclark> with the caveat that not everything has moved, I guess we should just double check (if we haven\'t already) that all pages that have been migrated have had their content removed and notices or redirects put in place
2016-12-02T16:20:13 <Justin_o> okay :)
2016-12-02T16:20:14 <colinclark> or deleted
2016-12-02T16:20:19 <colinclark> or whatever is good :)
2016-12-02T16:20:25 <colinclark> you\'ve probably already done this
2016-12-02T16:20:27 <colinclark> I just wanted to make sure
2016-12-02T16:20:59 <Justin_o> i believe all the pages were frozen with a notice put at the top to look at the infusion docs, but i\'ll double check
2016-12-02T16:22:27 <colinclark> cool, thanks
2016-12-02T16:22:40 <colinclark> we seem to be slowly winning with Google
2016-12-02T16:22:46 <Justin_o> well maybe it hasn\'t been done, but i\'ll look into it
2016-12-02T16:22:50 <colinclark> more and more I see the docs site getting the highest rank
