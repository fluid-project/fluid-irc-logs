b'2016-03-30T17:51:27 <cindyli> thanks, Katy_, let me know, also digging the email
2016-03-30T17:51:36 <colinclark> Katy_: Also, depending on what you\'re doing, you can actually just use vagrant to run the system in a VirtualBox VM
2016-03-30T17:51:58 <colinclark> with just a few commands :)
2016-03-30T17:53:28 <cindyli> Katy_: Bosmon\'s email about windows installation - http://lists.gpii.net/pipermail/architecture/2016-March/004001.html
2016-03-30T17:53:58 <Bosmon> It should be fine with 5.8 too - Katy_ \'s messages look like she is pointing at the wrong branch
2016-03-30T17:54:05 <Bosmon> The essential thing, though, is to be using npm 2.x
2016-03-30T17:54:05 <Katy_> cindyli it did not work with node 4.2.1.  Let me look at Bosmon\'s email.
2016-03-30T17:54:26 <Bosmon> Katy_ - here is the version of package.json from my branch: https://github.com/amb26/universal/blob/GPII-1318/package.json
2016-03-30T17:54:44 <Bosmon> As you can see it doesn\'t include any of the contents that you are getting errored out of npm
2016-03-30T17:54:45 * yzen is now known as yzen_
2016-03-30T17:54:51 <Bosmon> Are you sure you\'ve managed to check out the branch correctly?
2016-03-30T17:56:15 <Bosmon> I might have missed the start of this conversation
2016-03-30T17:56:20 * Jess_ has quit
2016-03-30T17:56:36 <Bosmon> If you\'re dealing with universal trunk, you need to use node 0.10.x and npm 1.4.x
2016-03-30T17:57:21 <Bosmon> cindyli - have you been getting Katy running with trunk or with my branch?
2016-03-30T17:58:00 <cindyli> Bosmon: i pointed Katy_ to use ur GPII-1318 branch
2016-03-30T17:59:06 <Katy_> perhaps, I did the git clone incorrectly.
2016-03-30T17:59:11 <Katy_> let me find what I did
2016-03-30T17:59:26 <colinclark> Katy_: No worries! We\'ll help however we can
2016-03-30T17:59:29 <Bosmon> If only dipesh were here, he could work through this too
2016-03-30T17:59:37 <colinclark> oh yes, that would be helpful
2016-03-30T17:59:42 <colinclark> a group install and run session
2016-03-30T18:01:16 * colinclark has quit
2016-03-30T18:02:06 <cindyli> Katy_: just in case, you need to first create a "node_modules" folder and clone the universal repo in there.
2016-03-30T18:02:07 <Katy_> what should by git clone be?  I believe I did "https://github.com/amb26/universal.git".  what is the url for branch 1318
2016-03-30T18:03:05 <cindyli> Katy_: the proper way to do it, which is good for your future GPII development, is to clone "https://github.com/gpii/universal" and add antranig\'s universal repo as a remote
2016-03-30T18:05:37 <cindyli> Katy_: i\'m going to paste some instruction here. start with your local development folder, with commands that i used with mac terminal, which you can use with a cygwin terminal on windows:
2016-03-30T18:05:47 <cindyli> mkdir gpii
2016-03-30T18:05:50 <cindyli> cd gpii
2016-03-30T18:06:17 <cindyli> actually, instead of spamming here, let me put all commands into a gist and send to you, Katy_
2016-03-30T18:06:29 <Katy_> cindyli sounds like a good idea

2016-03-30T18:16:51 <cindyli> let me know how it goes
2016-03-30T18:17:08 <avtar> Justin_o: no, i haven\'t
2016-03-30T18:17:25 <Katy_> thanks cindyli
2016-03-30T18:17:30 <cindyli> np
2016-03-30T18:17:57 <Justin_o> avtar: i wonder if we should try to hook it up to our repos
2016-03-30T18:18:12 <Justin_o> seems like it\'s free for open source and that we can define our own style guide
2016-03-30T18:18:43 <avtar> from the looks of it they automate the invocation of jshint?
2016-03-30T18:19:24 * clown joined the channel
2016-03-30T18:19:38 <avtar> i wonder what benefits using a dedicated service like that would provide as opposed to getting travis or jenkins to do the same...
2016-03-30T18:20:09 <Justin_o> avtar: if we can get them working that\'d be fine too.. just think it would be nice to have the linting checked on the pull request automatically
2016-03-30T18:20:53 <avtar> agreed
2016-03-30T18:21:12 * yzen is now known as yzen_
2016-03-30T18:21:14 <Justin_o> it\'s unfortunate that hound doesn\'t just use the projects jshintrc file by default
2016-03-30T18:21:50 <avtar> i think we would need to set up infusion\'s ci config to run jshint if it doesn\'t already and then also enable jenkins github pr plugin
2016-03-30T18:22:08 <Justin_o> avtar: how difficult do you think that would all be
2016-03-30T18:22:13 <Justin_o> and would it check all PRs?
2016-03-30T18:22:17 <avtar> yes
2016-03-30T18:22:24 <avtar> the first task shouldn\'t be too difficult
2016-03-30T18:22:27 <Justin_o> and we can get it to do the unit tests as well?
2016-03-30T18:23:56 <avtar> we can get the ci server to run anything that is possible using command line on dev workstations
2016-03-30T18:24:27 <Justin_o> avtar: and comment on PRs about it?
2016-03-30T18:24:34 <avtar> yup
2016-03-30T18:24:44 <Justin_o> that\'s awesome

2016-03-30T18:26:14 <avtar> Justin_o: the github pr builder plugin uses gh\'s status updates to provide feedback http://kabisa-website-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/github.png
2016-03-30T18:27:11 <Justin_o> will it be able to give details on any issues that come up?
2016-03-30T18:28:52 <avtar> i think a visit to the jenkins dashboard might be required for those types of details
2016-03-30T18:29:28 <Justin_o> hmm.. i guess as long as that\'s publicly available it\'ll be fine, as the person submitting the pull request will need to have access to it

2016-03-30T20:47:11 <cindyli> Bosmon: I submitted a pull request that update README in the universal repo, /examples directory, with instructions on running the sample client with the cloud based configuration. This was originated from katy\'s question earlier today asking for an OAuth client component that uses the OAuth work flow. this instruction is about how to get an example client work.
2016-03-30T20:48:40 <cindyli> Bosmon: since it\'s only a README change, i used "NOJIRA". if you think that\'s improper, let me know. also, if you are hesitating about merging more things into the giant pull request and would like me to issue the pull request to the master trunk after the giant goes in, let me know as well. Thanks!

2016-03-30T14:02:51 <cindyli> Katy_: the work flow for the client credentials grant - http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.4

2016-03-30T14:12:44 <cindyli> Katy_: the login for the oauth process - https://flowmanager.gpii.net/login, let me know if you would like to have a look on the source code, i can find that piece from universal github repo

2016-03-30T14:51:44 <Katy_> and will post questions that I will have
2016-03-30T15:00:46 <cindyli> Katy_: you might have known this. when you look at the source code, use bosmon\'s GPII-1318 branch - https://github.com/amb26/universal/tree/GPII-1318. this branch has upgraded GPII to use recent versions of node, express, kettle, infusion

2016-03-30T16:46:24 <Katy_> Cindy, I cloned  GPII-1318 branch - https://github.com/amb26/universal/tree/GPII-1318.  That branch doesn\'t look like it has oauth or passport.  For exmaple I don\'t see the oauth2orize and passport node modules

2016-03-30T16:57:58 <cindyli> Katy_: did you run "npm install" for this project?
2016-03-30T16:58:40 <cindyli> Katy_: a good reference of how to install - https://github.com/gpii/universal, the "installation" section
2016-03-30T16:59:00 <cindyli> in particular, read from "For development purposes this repository could be cloned directly\xe2\x80\xa6 "
2016-03-30T16:59:58 <cindyli> Katy_: pls use my irc nickname "cindyli" when you talk to me, so i will get an alert of having a new msg and won\'t keep you waiting too long
2016-03-30T17:00:19 <Bosmon> Hi there Katy_ :)
2016-03-30T17:00:40 <Katy_> Thanks cindyli
2016-03-30T17:00:44 <Katy_> Hi Bosmon
2016-03-30T17:02:30 <cindyli> Katy_: the node dependencies of this project can be found at https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/package.json
2016-03-30T17:03:47 <cindyli> i\'ll be away for half an hour.
2016-03-30T17:11:34 <simonjb> colinclark, Bosmon and anyone else, I\'d like to use \'npm install\' to manage dependencies for nexus-examples and would like to pull in something that isn\'t an npm package (no package.json) -- do you have any experience doing that? I found https://www.npmjs.com/package/napa
2016-03-30T17:11:46 * michelled has quit
2016-03-30T17:11:57 <Bosmon> simonjb - what kind of thing is the thing you\'d like to pull in?
2016-03-30T17:12:07 <simonjb> https://github.com/teco-kit/p4a-sensorAPI
2016-03-30T17:12:13 <simonjb> client side javascript
2016-03-30T17:12:20 <simonjb> for the nexus demo examples
2016-03-30T17:12:23 <colinclark> Ah, only a Bower package
2016-03-30T17:12:30 <simonjb> yeah
2016-03-30T17:12:51 <Bosmon> simonjb - I wonder if an npm postinstall step that runs bower install is reasonable?

2016-03-30T17:15:03 <simonjb> Bosmon: yeah, that might be a good option

2016-03-30T17:44:39 <colinclark> simonjb: Or a pull request?
2016-03-30T17:44:57 <colinclark> Maybe we should just contribute an npm package.json file to their repository
2016-03-30T17:46:10 <Katy_> cindyli I tried again the npm install.  I am using a window 7 OS.  Tried different node versions too. Using node 5.8.0, I see the following warnings.  npm WARN Invalid version: "0.1" npm WARN universal No description npm WARN universal No repository field. npm WARN universal No README data npm WARN universal No license field.
2016-03-30T17:47:16 <Katy_> cindyli  And after the npm install I still don\'t see the passport or oauthorize node modules.
2016-03-30T17:47:41 <simonjb> colinclark: yes, that\'s a good suggestion also
2016-03-30T17:48:39 <cindyli> Katy_: i sort of rmb Bosmon has an email to the list about using his branch in windows, let me check
2016-03-30T17:48:39 <simonjb> I\'ll see if I can get it to work first (using bower)
2016-03-30T17:48:39 <colinclark> Hi Katy_: We don\'t yet support Node.js 5.8.0
2016-03-30T17:48:39 <colinclark> Right now, Antranig\'s prerelease branch updates us to the LTS release of Node.js
2016-03-30T17:48:40 <Katy_> I also tried node 4.4.1
2016-03-30T17:48:45 <colinclark> whereas the 5.x is not an LTS release
2016-03-30T17:50:28 <cindyli> Katy_: according to Bosmon\'s pull request message - https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/425, this branch supports node 4.2.1
2016-03-30T17:51:01 <Katy_> cindyli. let me download node 4.2.1 and see how it behaves
2016-03-30T17:51:12 <colinclark> Katy_: Were you able to look at the instructions Bosmon posted to the list recently about running it on Windows?
