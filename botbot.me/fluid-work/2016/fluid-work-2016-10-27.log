2016-10-27T13:42:25 <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: anyone interested in a quick chat about some of the issues that were surfaced during yesterday's testing
2016-10-27T13:42:51 <Justin_o> I think there's at least one blocker and there are a few others that could be candidates
2016-10-27T13:44:09 <Justin_o> blocker - https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5993
2016-10-27T13:44:48 <Justin_o> candidates - https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5994, https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5996,
2016-10-27T13:44:50 <Justin_o> https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6000
2016-10-27T13:45:29 <alanharnum> Justin_o: sure - in channel, or Vidyo?
2016-10-27T13:45:47 <alanharnum> i've got PRs fox 6000 and 5994, though there are still some validation issues with other demos.
2016-10-27T13:46:16 <Justin_o> here are all the issues filed since yesterday https://issues.fluidproject.org/issues/?filter=-6&jql=project%20%3D%20FLUID%20AND%20created%20%3E%3D%202016-10-26%20AND%20created%20%3C%3D%202016-10-27%20order%20by%20created%20DESC
2016-10-27T13:47:27 <Justin_o> alanharnum: it might be quicker in Vidyo
2016-10-27T13:47:44 <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: is anyone else interested in joining our discussion of Infusion blockers
2016-10-27T13:49:13 <jhung> I'll listen in Justin_o. Vidyo?

2016-10-27T17:48:56 <David123_> Justin_o: do we report any typos or spelling mistakes?
2016-10-27T17:49:11 <Justin_o> gtirloni: looking at the examples directory on the build site, it seems to be out of date http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/examples/framework/preferences/
2016-10-27T17:49:28 <Justin_o> the dates are all several months to a year old
2016-10-27T17:49:39 <Justin_o> gtirloni: do you know if the builds are actually moving the files over correctly?
2016-10-27T17:51:14 <gtirloni> it looks like the new infusion job is not configured to push to the website, like the old one
2016-10-27T17:51:41 <Justin_o> ;(
2016-10-27T17:51:44 <gtirloni> a year old though? do you the URL for that one?
2016-10-27T17:52:53 <Justin_o> gtirloni: i'm just looking at the dates for the directories there
2016-10-27T17:52:58 <Justin_o> http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/examples/framework/preferences/
2016-10-27T17:53:14 <Justin_o> on my local machine those are all september of this year
2016-10-27T17:53:44 <gtirloni> ok, that shouldn't change, unless the file list inside the directory gets changed (the dir is just a file with a list of files)
2016-10-27T17:53:55 <gtirloni> i'm checking the CI definitions to see what changed
2016-10-27T17:54:27 <gtirloni> i'll add the publisher step back, that's what's missing
2016-10-27T18:00:22 <Justin_o> David123_: sorry, didn't get a chance to reply to you earlier. it's good to track the typos and etc. as well
2016-10-27T18:00:35 <Justin_o> they'll be minor bugs but we should clean them up at some point
2016-10-27T18:00:51 <simonjb> hey gtirloni, I was just chatting with Justin_o about old files on the server -- I'm wondering if maybe we are seeing old files in the case that files have been renamed? that is: we copy over existing and don't remove before updating?
2016-10-27T18:01:13 <David123_> Justin_o: okay thx
2016-10-27T18:01:23 <simonjb> so, we have both old files that are hanging around plus the new ones
2016-10-27T18:03:04 <simonjb> we have both http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/examples/framework/preferences/conditionalAdjusters/index.html and http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/examples/framework/preferences/conditionalAdjusters/nativeHTML.html
2016-10-27T18:03:22 <simonjb> whereas in the source repo, index.html doesn't exist anymore
2016-10-27T18:03:29 <simonjb> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/tree/master/examples/framework/preferences/conditionalAdjusters
2016-10-27T18:10:43 <gtirloni> simonjb: looks like it. the publisher step is indeed running every time the job run, but i remember we didn't have 'clean-remote' available in jenkins job builder when we create this job (even though the underlying jenkins publisher-over-ssh plugin had it). but now i have some memories of that not working
2016-10-27T18:11:10 <gtirloni> Justin_o simonjb: do you think the site is out of date or is it carrying old content (but has newer content)?
2016-10-27T18:11:44 <Justin_o> gtirloni, simonjb: it seems like the latter
2016-10-27T18:12:11 <Kobi> Justin_o: not to keep bothering you, but if David123_ or I found errors, do we mark it as done on the Google doc?
2016-10-27T18:13:45 <Justin_o> Kobi: yes, but i'll swing by, we'll want to write up and surface any issues you've found.
2016-10-27T18:14:42 <simonjb> gtirloni: does the publisher have any alternate options like rsync?
2016-10-27T18:15:03 <simonjb> where we could configure to remove old files
2016-10-27T18:15:54 <gtirloni> simonjb: doesn't look like it -- http://docs.openstack.org/infra/jenkins-job-builder/publishers.html#publishers.ssh
2016-10-27T18:16:07 <gtirloni> simonjb: i'm checking if 'clean-remote' is working now
2016-10-27T18:16:21 <simonjb> awesome, thanks gtirloni
