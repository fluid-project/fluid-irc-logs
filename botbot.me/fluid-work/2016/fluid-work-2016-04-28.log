b"2016-04-28T19:18:43 <colinclark> or keep it up with a note?
2016-04-28T19:18:54 <simonjb> each demo now has its own directory and an index.html
2016-04-28T19:18:58 <colinclark> that's great
2016-04-28T19:19:19 <colinclark> Do you think, also, that this is a repo we should contribute to fluid-studios when it's ready?
2016-04-28T19:19:36 <simonjb> yeah, I was going to ask you about that
2016-04-28T19:19:57 <simonjb> we had discussed doing that and I think it makes sense
2016-04-28T19:21:06 <colinclark> ok, cool
2016-04-28T19:21:20 <simonjb> when do you think we should move it?
2016-04-28T19:21:41 <colinclark> I guess whenever you feel it's ready
2016-04-28T19:22:12 <colinclark> you've got some instructions there, which is great
2016-04-28T19:23:25 <simonjb> some of the dependencies of nexus-demos will change over the next little bit -- the AsTeRICS component and orientation sensor -- which may require updates to the demos
2016-04-28T19:23:53 <simonjb> we could wait until those have stabilized, or move it now and update as needed
2016-04-28T19:24:21 <simonjb> I don't have a strong feeling about timing -- what are your thoughts?

2016-04-28T19:28:18 <simonjb> Maybe it would be easier for me if we wait a little until the dependencies have stabilized (so I can easily make updates) but I'm also good to move sooner

2016-04-28T13:50:55 <colinclark> https://github.com/GPII/linux/pull/78/files
2016-04-28T13:51:07 <colinclark> I wonder if you\'d be willing to have a quick look at it?
2016-04-28T13:51:21 <colinclark> Hopefully jhernandez will too
2016-04-28T13:51:28 <colinclark> I\'ve done my best, but you know me...
