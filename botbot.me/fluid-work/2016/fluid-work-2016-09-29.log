2016-09-29T15:06:42 <gtirloni> i\'m going out for lunch but some food for thought
2016-09-29T15:06:54 <gtirloni> my host is fedora 24 (exact same OS as in the VM), i have an audio device
2016-09-29T15:07:02 <gtirloni> and the tests pass with FF49
2016-09-29T15:07:15 <gtirloni> i can try the pause/resume commands when i get back okay

2016-09-29T15:07:41 <gtirloni> simonjb: you got native linux right? does it work for you?
2016-09-29T15:09:08 <simonjb> gtirloni: yes, native linux, and for me the all-tests.html get stuck in TextToSpeech (FF49)
2016-09-29T15:10:30 <simonjb> TextToSpeech-test.html by itself gets stuck at the same point: 3/4
2016-09-29T15:13:59 <Justin_o> gtirloni: i\'m not getting it to pass at all in the vm, but i don\'t have the audio devices setup

2016-09-29T15:23:08 <simonjb> I\'m wondering if it\'s a difference between underlying speech engine on openSUSE vs Fedora

2016-09-29T15:49:32 <gtirloni> that\'s what the Vagrantfile defines for the VM
2016-09-29T15:50:03 <gtirloni> simonjb: does openSUSE use pulseaudio too?

2016-09-29T16:12:11 <alanharnum> gtirloni: thanks, writing a JIRA now
2016-09-29T16:12:53 <alanharnum> gtirloni: so I\'m clear, it works for you in Chrome on Fedora 24?

2016-09-29T16:24:37 <gtirloni> previous it seemed to work while running it locally on chrome 53 though. it\'s weird

2016-09-29T16:24:53 <alanharnum> weirder and weirder
2016-09-29T16:24:59 <alanharnum> ahh
2016-09-29T16:25:02 <alanharnum> try reloading it
2016-09-29T16:25:05 <alanharnum> we\'ve seen that issue before
2016-09-29T16:25:24 <alanharnum> it seems to be an issue with jqUnit and promises
2016-09-29T16:25:30 <gtirloni> hmm that worked, thanks
2016-09-29T16:25:42 <gtirloni> it progressed to pause/resume and stopped, so it\'s consistent now

2016-09-29T13:24:57 <Justin_o> alanharnum: it was looked at for the data visualization project, but in the end not used because it was hard to hook into the generated bits.
2016-09-29T13:24:58 <the-t-in-rtf> oh, god.  They use their issue tracker and not GH

2016-09-29T13:26:03 <Justin_o> although we did start using milestones to mark some of our PRs for our upcoming release
2016-09-29T13:26:53 <Justin_o> alanharnum: seems like Bosmon and his student are also working on ways to integrate D3 with infusion, and had used the chart authoring work as inspiration. It may be useful to you to sync up with them at some point to see if there is anything that can be shared
2016-09-29T13:27:22 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, they claim November 1st for the next release:  https://bugs.jqueryui.com/milestone/1.12.2

2016-09-29T14:26:01 <Justin_o> gtirloni: hello, picking up on the unit test failures
2016-09-29T14:26:38 <gtirloni> cindyli: i tried creating a simpler situation with a cyclic dependency and npm3 worked fine.. i guess it needs a more complex case. there are lot of stack exceeded issues opened for npm, very few with any reply
2016-09-29T14:26:40 <gtirloni> Justin_o: hi
2016-09-29T14:27:14 <Justin_o> gtirloni: that are breaking the Infusion builds. I think the tests are halting at the TextToSpeech tests. Do you know if there is an audio driver installed on the vm there? Also is there a timeout, i think the timeout for the the feature detection is 5 seconds for TextToSpeech, so perhaps something else is timing out before that
2016-09-29T14:27:27 <Justin_o> alanharnum: did you have any other ideas about what might be causing it?
2016-09-29T14:28:06 <gtirloni> Justin_o: yes, there is an audio device in the VM. the jobs are timing out at 17min mark.
2016-09-29T14:28:52 <alanharnum> Justin_o: nope - is this a Linux VM?
2016-09-29T14:28:56 <Justin_o> gtirloni: do you know what the timeout limit for it is, that is.. does it timeout if nothing happens for 1 second?
2016-09-29T14:29:09 <Justin_o> gtirloni: also where did you see the issue when you were running it?
2016-09-29T14:29:18 <gtirloni> Justin_o: the timeout is for the whole job duration, i don\'t think it checks for output
2016-09-29T14:29:20 <alanharnum> i\'d check first of all if the TTS tests run and pass individually outside the all-tests context on Linux
2016-09-29T14:29:34 <gtirloni> Justin_o: i saw it on my own machine yesterday too. i\'m re-running the tests again now
2016-09-29T14:29:41 <Justin_o> gtirloni: thanks
2016-09-29T14:30:11 <Justin_o> gtirloni: i\'m trying with testem again too, i destroyed and re-upped the vm yesterday
2016-09-29T14:30:44 <cindyli> gtirloni: thanks for the investigation. I\'m also playing with package.json to find out what exactly causing the stack exceeded issue. as one reply in this thread - https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/10776. one relatively easy thing we could try with VM is to use "npm i --no-bin-links || npm i --no-bin-links" instead of a straight "npm install"
2016-09-29T14:30:50 <Justin_o> alanharnum: it\'s definitely an issue on the build site, but i haven\'t been able to reproduce it myself. gtirloni did yesterday though
2016-09-29T14:32:07 <gtirloni> cindyli: we\'ve no-bin-links in ~/.npmrc
2016-09-29T14:32:26 <cindyli> we already have?
2016-09-29T14:33:38 * kasparnet joined the channel
2016-09-29T14:33:44 <gtirloni> cindyli: yep https://github.com/idi-ops/ansible-nodejs/blob/master/tasks/configure.yml#L43-L50
2016-09-29T14:33:57 <gtirloni> cindyli: https://github.com/idi-ops/ansible-nodejs/blob/master/files/npmrc
2016-09-29T14:34:36 <Justin_o> alanharnum: running through testem now and it looks like it\'s halting on the Pause and Resume test
2016-09-29T14:34:50 <alanharnum> Justin_o: which OS / browser?
2016-09-29T14:35:11 <Justin_o> alanharnum: Fedora 24 and Firefox 49
2016-09-29T14:36:53 <alanharnum> Justin_o: they pass on OSX FF 48.0.1 with the TTS option turned on - let me upgrade FF & see if I see same issue
2016-09-29T14:36:59 * kasparne_ has quit
2016-09-29T14:37:04 <cindyli> gtirloni: the thread says, depending on the sub-dependency depth, "npm install" need to be run multiple times, well, at least twice (in the case of one sub dependency i think). that\'s why the command looks like "npm i --no-bin-links || npm i --no-bin-links"
2016-09-29T14:37:34 <Bosmon> That is absolutely ridiculous
2016-09-29T14:37:42 <Bosmon> But if it works .......
2016-09-29T14:38:48 <Justin_o> gtirloni, alanharnum: i think it didn\'t fail for me before because my vm was using FF 48
2016-09-29T14:39:06 <alanharnum> Justin_o: I wonder if this is connected: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1238538
2016-09-29T14:39:35 <Justin_o> alanharnum: could be, also the tests probably didn\'t run at all in FF before 49
2016-09-29T14:40:51 <alanharnum> Justin_o: yes, they wouldn\'t have
2016-09-29T14:40:57 <alanharnum> unless you manually turned on TTS
2016-09-29T14:41:26 <alanharnum> Justin_o: can you see if Pause/Resume work in the demo at http://eeejay.github.io/webspeechdemos/?

2016-09-29T14:46:55 * alanharnum has quit
2016-09-29T14:48:35 <Justin_o> gtirloni: are you running a native linux
2016-09-29T14:48:51 <Justin_o> could you try that link that alanharnum mentioned above?
2016-09-29T14:49:03 <Justin_o> i can\'t seem to hear the audio through my vm
2016-09-29T14:50:17 <gtirloni> Justin_o: it looks like something changed in the host audio.. at least here this worked:
2016-09-29T14:50:20 <gtirloni> edit Vagrantfile
2016-09-29T14:50:31 * alanharnum joined the channel
2016-09-29T14:50:47 <gtirloni> change this line:
2016-09-29T14:50:50 <gtirloni> vm.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--audio", "pulse", "--audiocontroller", "ac97"]
2016-09-29T14:51:17 <gtirloni> from "null" to "pulse" .. the thing is, PulseAudio is a Linux thing.. and it\'s what I needed to change to hear idea from my local VM
2016-09-29T14:51:41 <gtirloni> that being said, even with audio coming out of the VM (browsed youtube to confirm), the Pause/Resume test still fails
2016-09-29T14:52:08 <gtirloni> so I guess audio=null is just so your speaks aren\'t going crazy when running tests (we don\'t have speakers on servers so that\'s okay)
2016-09-29T14:52:23 <Justin_o> gtirloni: could be, alanharnum pointed to a bug report from firefox that seems to suggest that they don\'t support pause/resume in linux
2016-09-29T14:52:27 <gtirloni> but the audio device exists and is able to accept commands and spill out virtual noise.. it\'s just doesn\'t make its way to the host
2016-09-29T14:52:38 <gtirloni> cool, that makes sense
2016-09-29T14:52:54 <gtirloni> alanharnum Justin_o: the eejay URL didn\'t work for me on native Linux with Firefox 49.. it worked with Chrome though
2016-09-29T14:53:06 <Justin_o> gtirloni: cool thanks for verifying that
2016-09-29T14:55:37 <gtirloni> yw
2016-09-29T14:55:55 <Justin_o> alanharnum: so in FF 49 on linux, using the developer console i did "speechSynthesis.paused" it returned false
2016-09-29T14:56:09 <Justin_o> then "speechSynthesis.pause()"
2016-09-29T14:56:23 <Justin_o> then "speechSynthesis.paused", returned true
2016-09-29T14:56:38 <alanharnum> interesting
