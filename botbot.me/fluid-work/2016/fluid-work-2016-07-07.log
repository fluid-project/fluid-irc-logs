2016-07-07T20:03:48 <michelled1> yay, Justin_o! lazy loading UIO pull request :)
2016-07-07T20:04:23 <Justin_o> michelled1: :) hopefully my implementation is okay
2016-07-07T20:04:40 <michelled1> I suppose we might have to wait for next for a review
2016-07-07T20:05:43 <Justin_o> michelled1: yah.. i figured that'd be the case... i imagine colinclark and Bosmon will want to look it over.

2016-07-07T17:03:30 <danayo> PaliwalSparsh: I\'m having a look at those contrast filters
2016-07-07T17:03:30 <danayo> trying inverted greyscale
2016-07-07T17:03:30 <danayo> there are lots of places where the contrast is very low
2016-07-07T17:03:37 <danayo> Justin_o also ^
2016-07-07T17:04:00 <danayo> for example, when the rat first appears in the doorway
2016-07-07T17:04:12 <danayo> and also the shadow effects look strange
2016-07-07T17:04:21 <danayo> and the rat against the floor
2016-07-07T17:04:55 <danayo> do I understand correctly that we wouldn\'t be able to use this but tweak it somewhat to improve contrast?
2016-07-07T17:06:15 <danayo> the language scene looks a little better PaliwalSparsh, Justin_o
2016-07-07T17:06:58 <danayo> but still some issues with e.g. rat\'s noses/feet/tails against the floor - they are almost washed out completely
2016-07-07T17:07:34 <danayo> PaliwalSparsh: could you please drop link to lastest working version here? I think I\'m using an old one
2016-07-07T17:08:57 <PaliwalSparsh> https://cdn.rawgit.com/PaliwalSparsh/Discovery-Cat/master/demo/index.html
2016-07-07T17:09:06 <PaliwalSparsh> danayo: This is the most recent
2016-07-07T17:10:01 <danayo> thanks PaliwalSparsh
2016-07-07T17:11:57 * kasparnet has quit
2016-07-07T17:14:09 <danayo> hmm PaliwalSparsh, that appears to be an older version - shift-tab, language selection not working, doors missing in the room etc
2016-07-07T17:16:58 <PaliwalSparsh> danayo i will check
2016-07-07T17:18:43 <PaliwalSparsh> danayo feels like there is some other issue where is your game starting from
2016-07-07T17:18:56 <PaliwalSparsh> the link i send you starts game from sizePref
2016-07-07T17:19:37 <PaliwalSparsh> it could be I guess old game cached in the browser
2016-07-07T17:20:07 * gabrielmancini has quit
2016-07-07T17:22:47 <PaliwalSparsh> Please can you delete the cache and try again with the link
2016-07-07T17:22:47 * gabrielmancini joined the channel
2016-07-07T17:23:07 <danayo> ok PaliwalSparsh, got it now - so it\'s just the text size room, yes? i can\'t exit
2016-07-07T17:23:49 <PaliwalSparsh> oh sorry that is a bug I just figured out I have bugged it will push in just a min sorry for the inconvinience

2016-07-07T17:29:42 <PaliwalSparsh> danayo sorry for all the problem https://cdn.rawgit.com/PaliwalSparsh/Discovery-Cat/master/demo/index.html
2016-07-07T17:29:51 <PaliwalSparsh> This will work
2016-07-07T17:29:52 <PaliwalSparsh> fixed it
2016-07-07T17:30:28 <michelled> TPark, godfrey_: http://sprout.tigweb.org/
2016-07-07T17:33:06 <danayo> same problem PaliwalSparsh
2016-07-07T17:33:21 <PaliwalSparsh> danayo did you clear cache
2016-07-07T17:33:48 <danayo> yes

2016-07-07T17:37:30 <PaliwalSparsh> Oh sorry I checked it and pushed dont know whats causing the issue
2016-07-07T17:40:11 <PaliwalSparsh> danayo its working on my pc, its a problem with rawgit
2016-07-07T17:42:20 <danayo> ok PaliwalSparsh, I\'ll try again. Did you see my comments about contrast?
2016-07-07T17:42:20 <PaliwalSparsh> danayo: Which comment the one here in the chat. Should i give you link to the one which i showed you in the last meeting.
2016-07-07T17:45:10 <PaliwalSparsh> danayo: This is the last one please can you try this
2016-07-07T17:45:10 <PaliwalSparsh> https://cdn.rawgit.com/PaliwalSparsh/Discovery-Cat/new3/demo/index.html
2016-07-07T17:45:37 <PaliwalSparsh> Though may be a bit buggy but you can access all screens to check the filters
2016-07-07T17:45:50 <danayo> yes, at 11:02 PaliwalSparsh
2016-07-07T17:46:18 <PaliwalSparsh> sure danayo thanks
2016-07-07T18:04:15 * clown_mtg has quit
2016-07-07T18:04:57 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh, danayo: just caught up in the conversation
2016-07-07T18:05:39 <PaliwalSparsh> Justin_o: rawgit is not updating the new commit I made
2016-07-07T18:06:34 <PaliwalSparsh> this created a lot of hassle
2016-07-07T18:11:48 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: i notice you are using the CDN link, did you create a new url for your work?
2016-07-07T18:12:40 <PaliwalSparsh> Justin_o: it works only on the production one not on the development one there it gives CORS error
2016-07-07T18:12:52 <PaliwalSparsh> I created the new link
2016-07-07T18:13:33 <PaliwalSparsh> I did that by making a duplicate branch of master and pushing it
2016-07-07T18:14:08 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: is the link still out of date now, or you got it working?
2016-07-07T18:14:54 <PaliwalSparsh> Yes the new one is working the older one was not updated.

2016-07-07T18:21:27 <PaliwalSparsh> Justin_o: It is working on my system dont know why
2016-07-07T18:21:27 <danayo> it\'s working for me too Justin_o PaliwalSparsh
2016-07-07T18:21:27 <Justin_o> so strange
2016-07-07T18:21:27 <Justin_o> :(
2016-07-07T18:22:25 <Justin_o> danayo, PaliwalSparsh: oh well, i saw a version this morning at least
2016-07-07T18:22:25 <danayo> with tab/shift-tab and hover and speech API updates! :)
2016-07-07T18:22:25 <Justin_o> danayo: what were thoughts on the contrast ?
2016-07-07T18:22:25 <Justin_o> danayo: oh i didn\'t see those :(
2016-07-07T18:22:25 <Justin_o> but i have something to look forward to at least :)
2016-07-07T18:22:32 <danayo> yes :)
2016-07-07T18:22:44 <danayo> did you see my previous comments about contrast Justin_o (at 11:02)
2016-07-07T18:26:57 <danayo> PaliwalSparsh: I wonder if you could make the hover state be the same as the mouse-down state (black text on green background). Right now, the black border looks a bit too similar to focus state
2016-07-07T18:27:40 <danayo> also, PaliwalSparsh, when I hit the skip button, I\'m getting that music-overlap thing happening again
2016-07-07T18:28:03 <PaliwalSparsh> Yes danayo when I sent you I also saw that and have fixe that.
2016-07-07T18:28:16 <PaliwalSparsh> the music-overlap
2016-07-07T18:28:20 <danayo> great PaliwalSparsh
2016-07-07T18:29:17 <PaliwalSparsh> danayo: You told in the doc that the focus by mouse and focus by tab should be different thats why I made that change.
2016-07-07T18:32:10 * jhernandez joined the channel
2016-07-07T18:32:10 <PaliwalSparsh> when you will tab it will be green border, when you use mouse it will be black border, but when you select using mouse it full green background
2016-07-07T18:32:44 * jhernandez has quit
2016-07-07T18:33:11 <Justin_o> danayo: yes, saw your comments. Wondering if there were any decisions made about that
2016-07-07T18:34:06 * colinclark has quit
2016-07-07T18:36:09 <danayo> yes PaliwalSparsh, focus by keyboard = green border. Having hover state (focus by mouse) = black border, in my opinion, looks too similar to a keyboard focus state.
2016-07-07T18:36:48 <danayo> I\'m not sure that we need a mousedown (mouse select) state that is different from hover
2016-07-07T18:37:31 <danayo> I think hover state would be better if it were something like what you have for mouse select now (black text on green background)
2016-07-07T18:37:40 * colinclark joined the channel
2016-07-07T18:38:02 <PaliwalSparsh> danayo I guess you are right, it is instantanious as we click next screen appears, there is no need for mouse down.
2016-07-07T18:38:17 <danayo> that\'s exactly what I"m thinking PaliwalSparsh
2016-07-07T18:38:58 <PaliwalSparsh> I think that would be great danayo
2016-07-07T18:39:42 <danayo> but we could still do something for mouse select - maybe even just black on white or ?
2016-07-07T18:39:49 <danayo> but we can try without and see how it looks
2016-07-07T18:40:13 <danayo> by the way, I noticed that if you hover over the keyboard-focussed item, the focus disappears altother
2016-07-07T18:43:07 <danayo> *altogether
2016-07-07T18:43:07 <danayo> Justin_o: no decisions made about contrast yet
2016-07-07T18:43:10 * colinclark has quit
2016-07-07T18:43:10 <Justin_o> danayo: okay, thanks
2016-07-07T18:43:10 <PaliwalSparsh> Yes danayo that happens did not know what to do then
2016-07-07T18:43:10 <danayo> if we try the new approach P
2016-07-07T18:43:10 <danayo> oops
2016-07-07T18:43:37 <danayo> if we try the new approach PaliwalSparsh, we should be able to show both at the same time - green border for keyboard focus, and green background for hover
2016-07-07T18:44:26 <PaliwalSparsh> yup that would work

2016-07-07T19:21:39 <PaliwalSparsh> filters
2016-07-07T19:21:41 <danayo> I tried the filters PaliwalSparsh
2016-07-07T19:21:41 <danayo> found a number of issues
2016-07-07T19:21:43 <danayo> of low contrast
2016-07-07T19:21:53 <danayo> it won\'t work on its own
2016-07-07T19:23:02 <danayo> but I dont\' know if we can tweak it somehow or ?
2016-07-07T19:23:10 <danayo> Justin_o ^ ?
2016-07-07T19:24:30 <Justin_o> danayo: if we were able to implement it ourselves we might be able to play tweak some additional settings like saturation and etc.. but i\'m not sure we could get it to be perfect
2016-07-07T19:25:47 <Justin_o> danayo: i guess we could also try tweaking the default colours so they play better with the filters
2016-07-07T19:26:24 <danayo> yeah Justin_o, that might be the best way to go
2016-07-07T19:26:32 <danayo> PaliwalSparsh ^
2016-07-07T19:28:10 <PaliwalSparsh> danayo, Justin_o: So should I start with the filters, we are leaving other option involving making new seperate sprite then.
2016-07-07T19:29:05 <PaliwalSparsh> We discussed its demerits too so we should go with filters only.
2016-07-07T19:31:52 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh, danayo: lets start with filters and see where we get with them.. we can fall back to the separate sprites if need be.. sound okay?
2016-07-07T19:32:20 <PaliwalSparsh> Justin_o: Sure. That sounds good.
2016-07-07T19:33:21 <PaliwalSparsh> :) Thanks danayo, Justin_o have a good day, going to sleep.
2016-07-07T19:33:59 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: good night

2016-07-07T11:57:15 <PaliwalSparsh> Hi Justin_o
2016-07-07T11:58:01 <PaliwalSparsh> I was trying to see how would filters work on the game so i tried this chrome extension-
2016-07-07T11:58:17 <PaliwalSparsh> https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/high-contrast/djcfdncoelnlbldjfhinnjlhdjlikmph/related?hl=en
2016-07-07T11:58:22 <PaliwalSparsh> on the game screen
2016-07-07T11:58:30 <PaliwalSparsh> https://cdn.rawgit.com/PaliwalSparsh/Discovery-Cat/master/demo/index.html
2016-07-07T11:59:12 <PaliwalSparsh> Please can you try and see if that will work or we should make seperate sprites.
2016-07-07T11:59:27 <PaliwalSparsh> I imagine we can apply similar filters
2016-07-07T12:02:40 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: it\'s interesting that the glasses are hard to see if with many of the filters
2016-07-07T12:02:53 <Justin_o> it\'s kind of what i was worried could happen
2016-07-07T12:05:12 <PaliwalSparsh> Oh yes you also expressed this during the meeting, please can you go to the color pref room and try it there for once
2016-07-07T12:05:48 <PaliwalSparsh> I guess giving it a proper background white highlights the tool, like the paintbrush is highlighted
2016-07-07T12:06:01 <PaliwalSparsh> Justin_o ^
2016-07-07T12:07:24 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: yes that looks much better
2016-07-07T12:08:21 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: although it just occurred to me that you wouldn\'t want to invert the colour of the colour option. That is if you have a paint can that indicates that it makes the room white on black, you wouldn\'t want it to change to look black on white
2016-07-07T12:09:28 <Justin_o> jhernandez: by the way this chrome extension that PaliwalSparsh just showed me might be interesting for your chrome extension work https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/high-contrast/djcfdncoelnlbldjfhinnjlhdjlikmph/related?hl=en
2016-07-07T12:10:05 <PaliwalSparsh> Justin_o: Sure will keep that in mind. I was just looking at this extension for a filter that I would try and achieve for the game.

2016-07-07T12:10:43 <PaliwalSparsh> Justin_o: I felt the inverted grayscale looks good
2016-07-07T12:10:48 <PaliwalSparsh> what do you think.
2016-07-07T12:11:27 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: the contrast might still be a bit low, for example the cat against the background
2016-07-07T12:13:43 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: you could look at the WCAG guidelines for contrast, although they are really for text, you could follow the same guideline here http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/#visual-audio-contrast-contrast

2016-07-07T12:45:34 * anvk joined the channel
2016-07-07T12:45:58 <jhernandez> wrt the high contrast extension - yeah, I know it
2016-07-07T12:46:36 <Justin_o> jhernandez: ah okay... should have known you were on top of things :)
2016-07-07T12:46:59 <jhernandez> in fact I tried to use it, but it\'s hard to get it working since we can\'t tweak the settings
2016-07-07T12:48:09 <jhernandez> as far as I know, we can\'t "talk" to 3rd party extensions
2016-07-07T12:48:22 <Justin_o> jhernandez: it\'s really unfortunate when tools don\'t expose their settings. Do you know how the extension works?  Do you know if it is something that could be easily replicated?
2016-07-07T12:48:28 <jhernandez> we can just enable and disable them
2016-07-07T12:49:21 <jhernandez> I took a quick look at it, but can\'t remember details right now
2016-07-07T12:50:40 <jhernandez> and yeah, probably it\'s worth taking a look at how it actually works
2016-07-07T12:52:57 <Justin_o> jhernandez: i guess that makes sense for security and privacy reasons to not let extensions control each other
2016-07-07T12:53:09 <jhernandez> yeah
2016-07-07T12:53:46 <jhernandez> we can just enable/disable, listening for events, etc

2016-07-07T14:06:27 <PaliwalSparsh> Justin_o: These I am not completely sure I looked around I guess to maintain that contrast ratio of 4.5:1, the ratio is for foreground and background, but here the problem you highlighted was with ground and cat which are not overlapping. I am a bit confused.
2016-07-07T14:07:20 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: i was referring to the background and the cat.. that is the wall behind the cat
2016-07-07T14:07:29 <PaliwalSparsh> oh ok
2016-07-07T14:07:42 <PaliwalSparsh> I thought it was the base
2016-07-07T14:07:49 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: but i guess it would also be true of anything that the cat could walk in front of

2016-07-07T14:54:40 <DinukaDeSilva> Justin_o: Even in tolltip test cases, the same issue is there
2016-07-07T14:55:05 <DinukaDeSilva> the method is fluid.tests.tooltip.assertVisible
2016-07-07T14:56:04 <DinukaDeSilva> But, I couldn\'t find from where "Expected number of nodes" message comes
2016-07-07T14:56:27 <DinukaDeSilva> I guess it from jqUnit.assertNode.....
2016-07-07T14:56:33 <DinukaDeSilva> I\'m not sure
2016-07-07T14:59:19 <Justin_o> DinukaDeSilva: i think this is what you mean from jqUnit.assertNode https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/tests/test-core/jqUnit/js/jqUnit-browser.js#L137
2016-07-07T15:01:56 * jhung joined the channel
2016-07-07T15:04:17 <DinukaDeSilva> yes Justin_o
2016-07-07T15:04:26 <DinukaDeSilva> I just checked
2016-07-07T15:04:43 <DinukaDeSilva> with a small example
2016-07-07T15:05:14 <DinukaDeSilva> "Expected number of nodes" message comes from that jqUnit.assertNode method
2016-07-07T15:06:07 * kasparnet has quit
2016-07-07T15:06:34 <DinukaDeSilva> which is in "infusion\\tests\\test-core\\jqUnit\\js"
2016-07-07T15:07:18 <DinukaDeSilva> I\'l try fixing it
2016-07-07T15:09:36 <DinukaDeSilva> done
2016-07-07T15:09:39 <DinukaDeSilva> :)

2016-07-07T15:17:50 <danayo> TPark: we have the guidelines up on the gpiii wiki - probably the best place to find them right now. we\'re in the process of buidling a dedicated site.
2016-07-07T15:17:52 <danayo> https://wiki.gpii.net/index.php?title=Inclusive_Design_Guidelines&redirect=no
2016-07-07T15:18:30 <danayo> you can also find links to pdfs there, which are printable (styled) versions of the cards
2016-07-07T15:20:03 <TPark> danayo, got it, will take a look right now. Thanks again
2016-07-07T15:20:14 <danayo> TPark: we\'ve been updating the content somewhat as we build the new site, but the main content is there on the gpii wiki
2016-07-07T15:23:59 <godfrey_> danayo: thank you!
