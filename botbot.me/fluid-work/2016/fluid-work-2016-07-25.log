2016-07-25T20:47:38 <colinclark> bens__: I saw you were asking about the Nexus earlier. This wiki page is based on a deliverable we wrote for the European Commission. It's maybe a touch on the academic side, but describes what the Nexus is and our motivations for designing it: https://wiki.gpii.net/w/The_Nexus
2016-07-25T20:48:51 <bens__> thanks colinclark, added to the reading list

2016-07-25T16:49:42 <bens__> is it this API? https://wiki.gpii.net/w/Nexus_API
2016-07-25T16:50:40 <Justin_o> bens__: yes, i believe so
2016-07-25T16:50:58 <Justin_o> bens__: and here\'s simonjb\'s work https://github.com/simonbates/nexus
2016-07-25T16:51:30 <bens__> cool thanks Justin_o
2016-07-25T16:51:53 <Justin_o> bens__: np
2016-07-25T16:53:56 <jhung> Justin_o: The problem with Lindsay\'s site is that Infusion and UIO gets loaded properly, but UIO doesn\'t work. No exceptions are thrown in the console.
2016-07-25T16:54:59 <Justin_o> jhung: and by doesn\'t work you mean, doesn\'t initialize?
2016-07-25T16:56:06 <jhung> Possibly Justin_o.

2016-07-25T17:22:07 <jhernandez> how\'s your week looking like? can we meet at some point this week?
2016-07-25T17:23:26 <Justin_o> jhernandez: hello... maybe some time tomorrow or wednesday... I\'ll be off on Thursday and Friday
2016-07-25T17:32:16 <Justin_o> jhung: i think i have lindsay\'s site working.. want to chat?
2016-07-25T17:37:50 <Justin_o> simonjb, alanharnum: i\'m thinking about this weeks community meeting being about the nexus. Perhaps a quick overview ( I think most will have seen it ) and then we can take the rest of the time to either 1) come up with new ideas for demos / things to pair it with 2) some small hacks to make it work with other things. What do you think?
2016-07-25T17:38:19 <alanharnum> Justin_o: I think that could be cool
2016-07-25T17:38:36 <simonjb> Justin_o: sounds cool
2016-07-25T17:38:37 <alanharnum> and wouldn\'t require too much prep
2016-07-25T17:39:27 <Justin_o> alanharnum, simonjb: cool.. do you have a preference for option 1) or 2)?
2016-07-25T17:39:37 <Justin_o> or maybe cover both depending on how time goes
2016-07-25T17:40:43 <simonjb> Justin_o: start with 1) and do 2) if we identify some things that are feasible in the time?
2016-07-25T17:41:39 <Justin_o> simonjb: sounds good
2016-07-25T17:42:03 <Justin_o> simonjb: mind if I put you down as the facilitator?

2016-07-25T19:05:32 <jhung> danayo, sepidehshahi, alanharn_, simonjb, Justin_o, godfrey_, TPark - I\'ve tried adding notes to the PhET design meeting we had last Thursday. Can I ask you to add your notes to the document? Some people were not able to attend but were interested in the discussion. The document can be found here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-HFQFpnG6Pha8qqNXt9T9u3EYNiJgpqn61B74RutXWs/edit#heading=h.hq9uptuzjhqb
2016-07-25T19:34:22 <bens__> hi clown, i was away from irc last thursday/friday so wanted to check in with you about the edge.js process info idea if you had any questions
2016-07-25T19:42:12 * the-t-in-rtf has quit
2016-07-25T19:43:18 <simonjb> Justin_o: are you available for an infusion question?
2016-07-25T19:45:01 <simonjb> Justin_o: I\'ve hit a situation where I\'m trying to make a reference in a listener to a component that I think hasn\'t been created yet
2016-07-25T19:45:29 <simonjb> Justin_o: I know we have ways of dealing with this but I couldn\'t remember the recommended approach
2016-07-25T19:47:25 * jhung has quit
2016-07-25T19:50:38 <clown> hi bens__ thanks for asking.
2016-07-25T19:51:02 <clown> But, I immersed myself in edge those two days, and have everything I need.
2016-07-25T19:51:24 <bens__> clown, awesome!
2016-07-25T19:51:34 * clown immersed in edge, and dangled his feet in C#
2016-07-25T19:51:44 <alanharnum> this Toronto conference (in September) looks like it might be of interest to us: http://www.6degreesto.com/
2016-07-25T19:52:12 <clown> bens__ your example gist was very helpful.  Thanks again.
2016-07-25T19:53:38 <bens__> sure clown, you may have seen this.. but if not you may be interested
2016-07-25T19:53:52 <bens__> the .net source is available.. you can trace the stack starting here: http://referencesource.microsoft.com/#System/services/monitoring/system/diagnosticts/Process.cs,1548
2016-07-25T19:54:33 <bens__> eventually you\'ll get to here: http://referencesource.microsoft.com/#System/services/monitoring/system/diagnosticts/ProcessManager.cs,1034 where the bitness and underlying issues are still handled.. just by the framework itself
2016-07-25T19:55:04 <bens__> and then finally out to ntdll
2016-07-25T19:55:07 * clown looks
2016-07-25T19:55:13 <bens__> which you may have been doing anyway w/ node-ffi
2016-07-25T19:59:23 <clown> yes, bens__, re:  node-ffi, that looks spookily familiar.  Except that ".cs" code is more object oriented than the node-ffi stuff.
