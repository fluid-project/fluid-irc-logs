2016-09-30T18:44:58 <cindyli> gtirloni: i think i found what\'s causing the stack size exceeded error when running "npm install" with the universal root VM. it\'s caused by this config - https://github.com/idi-ops/ansible-nodejs/blob/master/files/npmrc
2016-09-30T18:45:23 <cindyli> setting "bin-links" to "true" makes the error go away
2016-09-30T18:46:14 <gtirloni> unfortunately we had to set it to false due to other issues we\'ve experienced with virtualbox shared folders (they don\'t like it)
2016-09-30T18:46:15 <cindyli> i guess there must be some reasons that this config is set to false with VM
2016-09-30T18:47:44 <gtirloni> https://github.com/idi-ops/ansible-nodejs/blob/master/tasks/configure.yml#L32-L38
2016-09-30T18:50:45 <gtirloni> i think we could make that an option though
2016-09-30T18:51:01 <gtirloni> so people running linux/osx hosts could bypass it
2016-09-30T18:51:12 <cindyli> gtirloni: you may have read these and tried them before. here are some comments on how to get sync folders working without \xe2\x80\x94no-bin-links work arounds: https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/9953#issuecomment-165884037
2016-09-30T18:51:47 <cindyli> and the following comment on the same page
2016-09-30T18:51:48 <gtirloni> the key datapoint in this issue is "windows 10"
2016-09-30T18:52:12 <gtirloni> it does work on win10, but other windows versions don\'t support the long path names
2016-09-30T18:52:17 <cindyli> gtirloni: ok, i see. it\'s a good idea to provide a way to bypass this option too
2016-09-30T18:52:46 <gtirloni> i\'ll make a change to the ansible-nodejs role and add a tunable
2016-09-30T18:52:52 <cindyli> thanks, gtirloni
2016-09-30T18:53:11 <gtirloni> thanks for verifying it works without that option
2016-09-30T18:53:39 <cindyli> btw, the link i pasted says: "the use of UNC paths lifts the 260 chars limit of the file path.

2016-09-30T19:35:41 <gtirloni> cindyli: if you edit the file provisioning/requirements.yml and change the nodejs URL to "https://github.com/gtirloni/ansible-role-nodejs" and then edit provisioning/vars.yml and add "nodejs_npm_symlinks: true" ... then vagrant destroy/up, it should work
2016-09-30T19:40:04 <cindyli> thanks, gtirloni. but the CI job triggered by the pull request would still fail. i wonder if we can use a flag to trigger the CI with bin-links setting to true
2016-09-30T19:41:10 <gtirloni> these changes would have to be on your PR
2016-09-30T19:42:19 <cindyli> ah, i see. awesome!!
2016-09-30T19:42:39 <gtirloni> i\'ll open a PR against ansible-nodejs but it\'ll need some review before it\'s merged
2016-09-30T19:42:48 <cindyli> ok
2016-09-30T19:46:36 <gtirloni> amatas avtar: https://github.com/idi-ops/ansible-nodejs/pull/32
2016-09-30T19:47:37 <gtirloni> in the end, it\'d be nice if npm3 got that fixed but the number of stack exceeded issues on github isn\'t very encouraging

2016-09-30T12:53:54 <colinclark> oh man, what a drag

2016-09-30T12:57:15 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - there\'s a 5th option - patch jQuery with a polyFill to re-support the size() function
2016-09-30T12:57:27 <Bosmon7> I guess that comes under your 3rd heading
2016-09-30T12:57:45 <Bosmon7> I bet if we go looking we\'ll find one instantly
2016-09-30T12:57:45 <colinclark> hey, it\'s Bosmon
2016-09-30T12:58:13 <Bosmon7> Hey there colinclark
2016-09-30T12:58:55 <colinclark> Is it as simple as forking the selectbox plugin and switching it from size() to .length?
2016-09-30T12:59:22 <Bosmon7> We could do that too
2016-09-30T12:59:26 <Justin_o> colinclark: i think so, although there may be other things that are broken that we can\'t see yet
2016-09-30T12:59:51 <colinclark> Worth a shot, to start
2016-09-30T13:00:03 <colinclark> just be ready not to go all the way down that rabbit hole if it turns out there are lots of issues
2016-09-30T13:01:34 <Bosmon7> fluid-everyone - just wanted to give the headsup about an "interesting" new framework facility

2016-09-30T13:37:24 <Justin_o> Bosmon, colinclark: what\'s our approach for mentioning and keeping track of patches on our 3rd party lib files?
2016-09-30T13:38:17 <colinclark> well, presumably we fork the repository and make note of the reasons why
2016-09-30T13:38:26 <colinclark> and commit to it as any other repository so there\'s a paper trail
2016-09-30T13:38:33 <colinclark> but is this plugin not forkable for some reason?

2016-09-30T13:42:32 <Justin_o> This stack overflow also mentions that the site is down. but the poster preserved a copy of the 1.2 version in a gist http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1072239/is-it-possible-to-style-a-select-box/1072266#1072266

2016-09-30T14:11:26 <Justin_o> colinclark:  :)
2016-09-30T14:11:30 <Justin_o> yes i\'m going through and publishing all of our releases on GitHub
2016-09-30T14:11:34 <colinclark> why?
2016-09-30T14:11:35 <colinclark> :)
2016-09-30T14:11:45 <Justin_o> Easier to track our history that way I feel
2016-09-30T14:12:08 <Justin_o> although i probably won\'t put up builds for all the versions, maybe just 1.5 and on
2016-09-30T14:13:20 <gtirloni> wow 2007.. where will the 10-year anniversary party be? :D

2016-09-30T14:16:17 <colinclark> yes, that sounds about right
2016-09-30T14:16:28 <colinclark> I think I probably have an email announcing it
2016-09-30T14:17:27 <colinclark> yeah, it looks like April
2016-09-30T14:17:56 * cindyli has quit
2016-09-30T14:21:15 <Justin_o> colinclark: yes, we should try to plan something for that.. hopefully we\'ll still remember come April 2017
2016-09-30T14:21:26 <colinclark> let\'s put it in the calendar
2016-09-30T14:21:40 <colinclark> and we can organize a party
2016-09-30T14:21:41 <Justin_o> colinclark: was there a specific date for that, or April 1?
2016-09-30T14:21:51 <Justin_o> yeah!!!
2016-09-30T14:22:12 <colinclark> maybe we\'ll aim for the 2nd :)
2016-09-30T14:22:36 <colinclark> that was the first real email posted to fluid-work
2016-09-30T14:22:44 <Justin_o> colinclark: cool
2016-09-30T14:23:01 <colinclark> in which I posted about REST and some heuristic evaluations
2016-09-30T14:23:52 <colinclark> and when Ray and Bosmon7 sparred about DWR
2016-09-30T14:24:09 <colinclark> and the UNIVERSAL VIEW BUS
2016-09-30T14:24:25 <Justin_o> colinclark: cool, i added it to the calendar
2016-09-30T14:24:57 <Bosmon7> hahaha
2016-09-30T14:25:01 <Justin_o> and put a link to the archive of that first e-mail
2016-09-30T14:25:21 <Bosmon7> I was thinking about something that we could consider an incarnation of the UNIVERSAL VIEW BUS in the shower just now
2016-09-30T14:25:35 <Bosmon7> Although you could claim that we have now build the UNIVERSAL VIEW BUS for real in the form of the GPII NEXUS
2016-09-30T14:27:15 <colinclark> what was the shower idea, Bosmon7?
2016-09-30T14:29:40 <Bosmon7> It is for the VISIBILITY MODEL
2016-09-30T14:29:50 <Bosmon7> I know we had a previous thing by that name that didn\'t get implemented either : P
2016-09-30T14:30:00 <Bosmon7> I was thinking about how tooltips would work for our new "universal GUI"
2016-09-30T14:30:16 <Bosmon7> And realised we needed to rearchitect the way we drive the evaluation of models
2016-09-30T14:30:39 <Bosmon7> This would do double duty since the same thing would occur with any remote "API" such as the GUI itself attached to a remote nexus
2016-09-30T14:30:53 <Bosmon7> I\'ll write up a JIRA just as soon as I get out of this bath towil : P
2016-09-30T14:32:59 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: i think we need to improve the way enactors work and are configured through the prefs framework, perhaps something like this could help with that too

2016-09-30T15:20:27 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: one thing is to be able to hook up view components as enactors. we have a few but configuring it is more difficult. Also for cases like the video player

You can now easily find prior releases along with their release announcements and notes. GitHub provides links to download package of the repo and links to the source
2016-09-30T17:41:50 <Justin_o> as well; however, builds of Infusion are only provided for Infusion 1.5.
