b'2016-05-19T21:16:25 <Bosmon> I would love to take those into pieces for you for recycling purposes :)
2016-05-19T21:16:26 * gtirloni chants merge! merge! merge! merge!
2016-05-19T21:16:40 <Bosmon> We\'ve got a long way to go yet, gtirloni ....
2016-05-19T21:17:00 <gtirloni> btw, when is the self-imposed deadline?
2016-05-19T21:17:09 <Bosmon> gtirloni - yesterday
2016-05-19T21:17:20 <Bosmon> gtirloni - we are just where the blue arrow is on the picture here: https://media.innogamescdn.com/com_FOE_PL/expeditions/expedition3.png
2016-05-19T21:17:38 <gtirloni> haha
2016-05-19T21:17:44 <Bosmon> As you can see, once we get to the first BOSS BATTLE the way is then shrouded in clouds
2016-05-19T21:18:04 <colinclark> wow, christophe is autopersonalizing Sublime Text with the GPII
2016-05-19T21:18:24 <colinclark> hey, do i get some kind of treasure once I merge this?
2016-05-19T21:18:29 <Bosmon> Yes
2016-05-19T21:18:38 <Bosmon> You might get 100 SUPPLIES
2016-05-19T21:18:51 <Bosmon> The first few chests have very small rewards : P
2016-05-19T21:18:55 <colinclark> perhaps via this chocolatey
2016-05-19T21:19:03 <colinclark> that I failed to install because the instructions told me to open powershell
2016-05-19T21:19:05 <colinclark> and I got scared
2016-05-19T21:19:14 <colinclark> <point point, click click>
2016-05-19T21:20:02 <Bosmon> So the first three encounters represent the 3 Infusion pulls
2016-05-19T21:20:09 <Bosmon> The LARGE CYAN GATE represents merging Kettle : P
2016-05-19T21:20:23 <colinclark> simonjb gets the CYAN GATE
2016-05-19T21:20:26 <colinclark> he\'s so lucky
2016-05-19T21:20:28 <Bosmon> After that you might receive TEN CURRENT GOODS
2016-05-19T21:20:52 <colinclark> I just get some treasure chest full of Powershell commands :(
2016-05-19T21:21:20 <Bosmon> After that the mists depart and we start to see the way towards a CI-TESTED NPM-DISTRIBUTED RELEASE : P
2016-05-19T21:21:28 <colinclark> :)
2016-05-19T21:22:03 <Bosmon> You can just about make out that Aztec-style face circle in the clouds which represents merging universal
2016-05-19T21:22:48 <colinclark> I guess kasparnet or jhernandez will probably be lucky recipients of the treasure after the Face Circle
2016-05-19T21:22:52 <simonjb> Bosmon, colinclark: https://github.com/simonbates/.emacs.d/blob/master/init.el#L298
2016-05-19T21:23:09 <colinclark> :)
2016-05-19T21:23:36 <Bosmon> Crikey
2016-05-19T21:23:43 <Bosmon> Your init.el is full of PROJJECKTTILES!
2016-05-19T21:24:40 <Bosmon> btw don\'t the contents of this .emacs file represent FISMA LEVEL 3 SENSITIVE INFORMATION?
2016-05-19T21:25:01 <simonjb> at least
2016-05-19T21:25:15 <colinclark> omg

2016-05-19T21:32:04 <colinclark> ooh, moonbook just made a nice little beep
2016-05-19T21:32:18 <Bosmon> What did it signify?
2016-05-19T21:32:25 <colinclark> I guess that it was getting tired
2016-05-19T21:34:13 <colinclark> Bosmon: I\'m getting test failures on the FLUID-5906 branch in Node.js
2016-05-19T21:34:32 <Bosmon> colinclark - what do they say?
2016-05-19T21:35:10 <colinclark> "Module test-module2 has not been loaded and could not be loaded from caller\'s path..."
2016-05-19T21:35:43 <colinclark> Does this require a minimum version of Node or npm or something that could be due to my environment?
2016-05-19T21:36:13 <Bosmon> colinclark - it might
2016-05-19T21:36:17 <Bosmon> Which node version do you have?
2016-05-19T21:36:32 <Bosmon> It relies on a V8 API which might have changed prior to 4.x
2016-05-19T21:36:52 <colinclark> node 4.2.1, npm 2.14.7
2016-05-19T21:36:59 <Bosmon> I see
2016-05-19T21:37:03 <Bosmon> The identical version to what I have here
2016-05-19T21:37:12 <Bosmon> What is the platform?
2016-05-19T21:37:40 <colinclark> Mac OS X whatchamacallit
2016-05-19T21:37:48 <colinclark> 10.10
2016-05-19T21:37:49 <Bosmon> I see
2016-05-19T21:37:52 <colinclark> let me try on Windows 10 here
2016-05-19T21:38:36 <colinclark> seems to be the same on Windows 10 with no fancy unixy stuff
2016-05-19T21:38:51 <colinclark> must be something dumb on my part, right?
2016-05-19T21:38:58 <colinclark> I\'ve recently done an npm install
2016-05-19T21:39:05 <Bosmon> wait...
2016-05-19T21:39:08 <colinclark> and then run "node tests/node-tests/basic-node-tests.js"
2016-05-19T21:39:12 <Bosmon> URGH
2016-05-19T21:39:25 <colinclark> BIG URGH
2016-05-19T21:39:26 <Bosmon> I failed to commit some crucial files... interestingly, because they were ignored by .gitignore
2016-05-19T21:39:46 <Bosmon> Let me fix both of those issues :)
2016-05-19T21:39:50 <colinclark> cool
2016-05-19T21:39:57 <colinclark> which files are omitted by .gitignore?
2016-05-19T21:40:02 <Bosmon> node_modules
2016-05-19T21:40:07 <colinclark> oh i see
2016-05-19T21:40:09 <Bosmon> But with the wrong syntax
2016-05-19T21:40:36 <colinclark> I\'ll move on to the next pull while you do that
2016-05-19T21:41:09 <colinclark> isApplicable!
2016-05-19T21:42:24 <Bosmon> colinclark - ok, FLUID-5906 updated
2016-05-19T21:42:28 <colinclark> great
2016-05-19T21:42:46 <Bosmon> I\'ll just nip off for a quick..... RRUNE
2016-05-19T21:42:55 <colinclark> good idea
2016-05-19T21:42:57 <colinclark> have fun
2016-05-19T21:43:40 <colinclark> ok, success on both platforms now
2016-05-19T21:44:41 <colinclark> avtar: You know I love how you added testem support, right?
2016-05-19T21:45:00 <colinclark> The one thing that very mildly bums me out about it is that it works better on my Moonbook than on my MacBook...
2016-05-19T21:45:05 <colinclark> and I don\'t remember if it did this before
2016-05-19T21:45:21 <colinclark> but it seems like on OS X, it can\'t launch browsers as the "key" window
2016-05-19T21:45:24 <colinclark> meaning in the forefront
2016-05-19T21:46:03 <avtar> hmm
2016-05-19T21:46:22 <Bosmon> What is a "key window"?
2016-05-19T21:46:32 <avtar> Bosmon: the window with focus
2016-05-19T21:47:05 <Bosmon> ah
2016-05-19T21:47:30 <avtar> colinclark: does your terminal maintain focus?
2016-05-19T21:49:18 <colinclark> I\'ll just run it now to verify
2016-05-19T21:49:34 <colinclark> yeah
2016-05-19T21:49:36 <colinclark> terminal stays key
2016-05-19T21:49:45 * simonjb has quit
2016-05-19T21:49:54 <colinclark> Bosmon: I believe the term "key window" is a NeXTSTEPism
2016-05-19T21:50:08 <Bosmon> colinclark - awesome :)
2016-05-19T21:50:33 <avtar> now i\'m doubting myself but i thought that it behaved the same way windows does
2016-05-19T21:50:39 <avtar> back in 2015
2016-05-19T21:50:48 <colinclark> https://books.google.ca/books?id=dCczblScSoYC&pg=PA45&lpg=PA45&dq=nextstep+%22key+window%22&source=bl&ots=onTtw350_D&sig=0AUFJWqkDCY27DwN46ErGIrP8dU&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwisn9Sxj-fMAhUHlR4KHSbYACgQ6AEIITAB#v=onepage&q=nextstep%20%22key%20window%22&f=false

2016-05-19T22:27:58 <colinclark> I had some vague memory of JIRA automatically closing issues when their pull requests are merged, but I guess we don\'t do that?

2016-05-19T22:38:19 <colinclark> ok
2016-05-19T22:38:37 <colinclark> will it eventually?
2016-05-19T22:38:44 <colinclark> or should I close the ones that haven\'t closed themselves?
2016-05-19T22:39:46 * Justin_o has quit
2016-05-19T22:40:13 <Bosmon> I think it might within an hour, if it is going to do it
2016-05-19T22:40:43 <Bosmon> colinclark - thanks for the awesome merges, DDD!
2016-05-19T22:40:49 <Bosmon> I have rolled.... a ....... RELLEASE! : P
2016-05-19T22:40:52 <colinclark> Oh awesome
2016-05-19T22:40:58 <colinclark> Talk about good timing
2016-05-19T22:41:06 <colinclark> I am just updating osc.js with the latest versions of everything
2016-05-19T22:41:09 * gloob has quit
2016-05-19T22:41:22 <colinclark> Being a dinosaur, I hadn\'t even noticed that grunt finally hit 1.0
2016-05-19T22:42:08 <Bosmon> It only happened quite recently
2016-05-19T22:42:18 <colinclark> osc.js is going to be so hip soon
2016-05-19T22:43:16 <colinclark> Does node-jqunit need to be updated with the latest release, or will it be ok?
2016-05-19T22:49:41 <Bosmon> colinclark - it will be fine
2016-05-19T22:50:22 <Bosmon> colinclark - kettle now updated to release
2016-05-19T22:50:31 <colinclark> great
2016-05-19T22:50:42 <colinclark> simonjb will be happy :)

2016-05-19T19:10:29 * danayo joined the channel
2016-05-19T19:10:37 <PaliwalSparsh> It is the basic currency converter example
2016-05-19T19:10:52 * Yan_Hu has quit
2016-05-19T19:11:13 * colinclark joined the channel
2016-05-19T19:11:35 <PaliwalSparsh> model is working and prototree is also functioning to map the model to template but modelListener and modelRelay has some problem i guess
2016-05-19T19:12:36 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: what is the issue you are getting?
2016-05-19T19:13:52 <PaliwalSparsh> Model is getting passed into template properly I am able to see currencies in the output page. But the converting part is not working.
2016-05-19T19:14:07 <PaliwalSparsh> When I click on Convert! nothing happens.
2016-05-19T19:14:53 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: by the way, there are some validation errors in your markup there. For one the <script> should be inside the <body> tag at the end.. and there is a stray closing </p>
2016-05-19T19:15:54 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: it doesn\'t look like your button is wired up to any code
2016-05-19T19:19:27 <PaliwalSparsh> Sorry for silly mistake. I guess it is the second one.
2016-05-19T19:21:47 <colinclark> Bosmon: So where are we at with pull requests? I noticed kasparnet disappeared right after I suggested he review your fixes...
2016-05-19T19:21:55 <colinclark> shall I go ahead and do so? Or has someone picked it up
2016-05-19T19:21:56 <colinclark> ?
2016-05-19T19:22:25 <colinclark> I have at least verified that the tests pass in your 5907 branch
2016-05-19T19:23:01 <Bosmon> colinclark - we have FLUID-5906, FLUID-5907, and there will be another one along in a few minutes
2016-05-19T19:23:18 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: no problem.. i guess the tutorial assumes some stuff has been built up from prior tutorials.
2016-05-19T19:23:34 <colinclark> Yes, I have 5906 open here and can merge it shortly
2016-05-19T19:23:43 <colinclark> but I\'m assuming 5907 should go in first since it fixes broken tests
2016-05-19T19:23:50 <colinclark> what\'s the next one coming along, Bosmon?
2016-05-19T19:24:07 <PaliwalSparsh> Thats why I made the mistake I was going from view to renderer compnent and things were different I guess
2016-05-19T19:24:22 <PaliwalSparsh> Justin_o ^
2016-05-19T19:25:57 <colinclark> Justin_o: I guess most people creating new Infusion components won\'t use the Renderer typically, right?
2016-05-19T19:26:45 <Justin_o> colinclark: yah, probably less and less so
2016-05-19T19:27:19 <colinclark> I really wouldn\'t recommend it for anyone unless they have a very particular problem that it solves for them
2016-05-19T19:27:59 <colinclark> but I guess working on stuff like UIO, it\'s a requisite
2016-05-19T19:28:30 <Bosmon> colinclark: https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5908
2016-05-19T19:32:11 <Justin_o> colinclark: yes, still needed for UIO.. but PaliwalSparsh you may not need to use it for your GSoC coding. You probably just need to know enough to understand how the current prefs editors work if you need to look through their code at all.

2016-05-19T20:20:53 <Justin_o> jhung: did you publish that to the docs site too?
2016-05-19T20:21:03 <colinclark> Bosmon: Sometime, I\'m curious to ask you about this comment above fluid.model.isSameValue()...
2016-05-19T20:21:14 <colinclark> which I found circuitously while reviewing your FLUID-5907 fix
2016-05-19T20:21:20 <colinclark> / TODO: replace with a pluggable implementation
2016-05-19T20:21:23 <jhung> Justin_o: not yet. I\'ll do that now.
2016-05-19T20:21:53 <colinclark> Bosmon: I assume a pluggable implementation would somehow parameterize the precision of the comparison or something?
2016-05-19T20:21:55 <Justin_o> jhung: cool thanks
2016-05-19T20:23:25 <Bosmon> fluid-everyone: OK ALL BRANCHES ARE READY
2016-05-19T20:23:30 <Bosmon> FIRE EVERY ZIG
2016-05-19T20:23:42 <Bosmon> colinclark - yes, it might
2016-05-19T20:24:05 <colinclark> great news about the zigs, Bosmon

2016-05-19T20:58:02 <colinclark> how\'s it going?
2016-05-19T20:58:17 <avtar> hi
2016-05-19T20:58:19 <avtar> it\'s going well
2016-05-19T20:58:54 <colinclark> I\'m mildly stuck
2016-05-19T20:59:04 <colinclark> On my shiny new Moonbook Pro
2016-05-19T20:59:28 <colinclark> "vagrant up" claims, falsely I\'m sure, that the inclusivedesign/fedora22 box can\'t be found
2016-05-19T20:59:50 <colinclark> When I go the URL for it in my browser, it definitely exists
2016-05-19T21:00:04 <colinclark> does any of this resonate with you at all?
2016-05-19T21:01:23 <avtar> colinclark: i\'m guessing your laptop doesn\'t have the visual studio c++ redistributable bits installed
2016-05-19T21:01:27 <colinclark> aha
2016-05-19T21:01:32 <colinclark> ok
2016-05-19T21:01:41 * michelled joined the channel
2016-05-19T21:01:45 <alanharnum> i really hope there\'s such a thing as a Moonbook Pro
2016-05-19T21:01:52 <colinclark> right here
2016-05-19T21:02:12 <colinclark> it even has a key with a moon on it
2016-05-19T21:02:22 <colinclark> the crucial, not-to-be-omitted moon key
2016-05-19T21:02:36 <colinclark> it has some other great ones too
2016-05-19T21:02:39 <colinclark> like "ScrLk"
2016-05-19T21:03:35 <colinclark> another one seems to have a picture of a propeller beside a trackpad
2016-05-19T21:06:01 <avtar> colinclark: i would try this https://chocolatey.org/packages/vcredist2010
2016-05-19T21:06:07 * yzen has quit
2016-05-19T21:06:20 <colinclark> cool
2016-05-19T21:06:29 <avtar> or install it without chocolatey https://download.microsoft.com/download/3/2/2/3224B87F-CFA0-4E70-BDA3-3DE650EFEBA5/vcredist_x64.exe
2016-05-19T21:06:33 <colinclark> once testem is done doing it\'s thing, I\'ll download chocolatey
2016-05-19T21:06:49 <colinclark> no problems running testem with just a standard copy of Node.js and Git for Windows
2016-05-19T21:07:09 <colinclark> I like this much more than VMs
2016-05-19T21:07:13 <colinclark> just having two computers :)
2016-05-19T21:09:17 <avtar> once you install \'ubuntu on windows\' it\'ll be like 2.5 computers
2016-05-19T21:09:24 <avtar> i\'m assuming
2016-05-19T21:11:05 <gtirloni> lol
2016-05-19T21:11:19 <gtirloni> almost enabled that today but thought it\'d be better to wait for the final release
2016-05-19T21:11:28 <gtirloni> avtar: do you have any insider information on the release date?
2016-05-19T21:12:03 <avtar> no insider information unfortunately :/
2016-05-19T21:12:13 <Bosmon> colinclark - and there you are, with your frizzy hair :)
2016-05-19T21:12:19 <avtar> i thought it was going to land sometime in the summer
2016-05-19T21:12:28 <colinclark> WHAT!?
2016-05-19T21:12:31 <colinclark> Take that back!
2016-05-19T21:12:31 <avtar> i\'m going to guess july
2016-05-19T21:12:38 <colinclark> My hair is so not frizzy!
2016-05-19T21:12:46 <colinclark> alanharnum: You can attest to this!
2016-05-19T21:13:36 <Bosmon> You don\'t have your SUMMER HAIR yet? : P
2016-05-19T21:13:59 <gtirloni> avtar: never understood why the branded linux version.. they could have gone with a nameless thing, with binutils and others
2016-05-19T21:14:26 <Bosmon> Oldest trick in the book that..... WEARING REAL HAIR :)
2016-05-19T21:14:33 <Bosmon> alanharnum will soon come to appreciate the force of this remark....
2016-05-19T21:14:57 <avtar> gtirloni: it paves the way for \'redhat on windows\'
2016-05-19T21:15:41 <colinclark> Bosmon: TESTEM SAYS "OK"
2016-05-19T21:15:44 <colinclark> on both platforms
2016-05-19T21:15:50 <Bosmon> Not to say... MINIX ON WINDOWS
2016-05-19T21:15:53 <colinclark> oooh
2016-05-19T21:16:02 <colinclark> I installed Minix from 26 5.25" floppies once
2016-05-19T21:16:11 <Bosmon> hahaha

2016-05-19T13:58:41 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: hello... i\'ll see if i can help
2016-05-19T13:59:56 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: are you talking about "values" in the "rates" object?
2016-05-19T14:00:39 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: sorry, just saw that you\'re talking about the model relay
2016-05-19T14:01:09 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: is it not working? do you get an error?
2016-05-19T14:03:14 <PaliwalSparsh> modelrelay => singleTransform => value
2016-05-19T14:03:23 <PaliwalSparsh> Yes it is not working
2016-05-19T14:04:20 <Justin_o> kasparnet, Bosmon: were there any changes to the linearScale transform recently. See PaliwalSparsh\'s comments above
2016-05-19T14:04:32 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, plenty
2016-05-19T14:04:56 <PaliwalSparsh> http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/ModelRelay.html
2016-05-19T14:05:16 <PaliwalSparsh> Here actually there was no options mentioned as "value"
2016-05-19T14:05:18 <Bosmon> kasparnet - could you add the necessary fixes to your docs pull?
2016-05-19T14:05:20 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: also there are some issues with the code at the bottom of the rendererComponent page as you mentioned.
2016-05-19T14:05:28 <PaliwalSparsh> Yes Justin_o
2016-05-19T14:05:32 <Bosmon> PaliwalSparsh - there has been a framework update which we are in the process of documenting
2016-05-19T14:05:40 <Bosmon> You should change the property name "value" to "input"
2016-05-19T14:05:50 <Justin_o> kasparnet: while you are updating the renderComponent page, could you fix the code example at the bottom too.. there are some syntax errors there
2016-05-19T14:06:42 <PaliwalSparsh> Bosmon - ok I will keep that in mind
2016-05-19T14:08:53 <kasparnet> Bosmon, Justin_o: yup, will do the update

2016-05-19T14:20:48 <avtar> i included some details in my reply on the list
2016-05-19T14:21:38 <colinclark> what a great response
2016-05-19T14:21:39 <Bosmon> Thanks avtar, that\'s awesome
2016-05-19T14:22:02 <colinclark> Bosmon: In the meantime, are you set up to run Infusion\'s tests in the Vagrant VM using testem?
2016-05-19T14:22:47 <colinclark> I believe you\'ll just need to utter the command "grunt tests" from your cygwin shell
2016-05-19T14:22:51 <colinclark> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion#run-tests-using-browsers-installed-in-a-vm
2016-05-19T14:23:13 <colinclark> after a "vagrant up," presumably
2016-05-19T14:23:55 <avtar> colinclark: yes, a vm will need to be available for that grunt task
2016-05-19T14:24:16 <colinclark> it\'s really useful
2016-05-19T14:24:50 <kasparnet> Justin_o, Bosmon: I\'m a bit confused about infusion-docs/src/static/lib/infusion/infusion-uio.js
2016-05-19T14:25:33 <kasparnet> is this something that is automatically built/added on infusion commits, or...?
2016-05-19T14:26:27 <Justin_o> kasparnet: i\'m not 100% sure, but I would assume that it\'s a static custom build
2016-05-19T14:27:06 <kasparnet> Justin_o: ok, I\'ll leave it be until someone replies that i should do otherwise on my pull erquest
2016-05-19T14:27:22 <Justin_o> kasparnet: yah, here\'s the version file that mentions how it was built https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/blob/master/src/static/lib/infusion/Version.md
2016-05-19T14:38:19 <Bosmon> kasparnet - I see the final piece of my confusion
2016-05-19T14:38:42 <Bosmon> That comment that I referred to about "no path means root path"
2016-05-19T14:39:10 <Bosmon> It\'s just years out of date
2016-05-19T14:41:57 <kasparnet> haha, shit
2016-05-19T14:42:06 <Bosmon> The whole point is that we *don\'t* consider that no path means root path, which is why all those transforms failed once they became considered standardInput
2016-05-19T14:43:22 <Bosmon> Except, bizarrely, for here: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/tests/framework-tests/core/js/DataBindingTests.js#L1185
2016-05-19T14:47:02 <Bosmon> It appears that this transform has only ever worked ....... in the inverse direction

2016-05-19T15:11:37 <Justin_o> jhung: i figured out the issue with the sliders in the john travoltage sim.. seems that they were all getting a width of 0px. Just adding a width of 1px fixed the problem. Seems that Safari requires width on them, which kind of makes sense.
2016-05-19T15:12:27 <jhung> Justin_o: that\'s awesome. Good to know. I think alanharn_ would like to know that since he\'s using range sliders as well.
2016-05-19T15:13:32 <alanharn_> Justin_o jhung: that\'s good to know
2016-05-19T15:13:33 <Justin_o> jhung: in most use cases, the slider will be visible on screen so it should happen naturally... with the PhET sim, it is hidden visually so that the user sees the arm or leg moving, which is why it had a width of 0px

2016-05-19T15:26:37 <colinclark> Justin_o, Bosmon: Do we still suffer from periodic failures of the Enactors tests in Infusion?

2016-05-19T15:27:40 <Justin_o> colinclark: hmm.. not sure.. which browser(s) are you seeing it in?
2016-05-19T15:28:26 <colinclark> Justin_o: Chrome while running the vagrant-based tests
2016-05-19T15:28:35 <jhung> Yeah if there\'s time. There are a lot of other topics that may be worth watching too Justin_o: http://www.inclusivedesign24.org/
2016-05-19T15:28:38 <colinclark> i.e. the way our tests will be run on the CI server very soon
2016-05-19T15:28:51 <Justin_o> jhung: thanks
2016-05-19T15:29:10 <jhung> Taliesin shared that link to the list earlier
2016-05-19T15:29:54 <Bosmon> colinclark - we do
2016-05-19T15:30:20 <colinclark> What is blocking them from being fixed, if anything?
2016-05-19T15:31:04 <Bosmon> colinclark - the fact that we don\'t understand why they fail, and we don\'t have the time to fix them :)
2016-05-19T15:31:24 <colinclark> Bosmon: This will make your request for test runs on CI somewhat moot, will it not?
2016-05-19T15:31:38 <colinclark> since we will receive regular and random failures from the CI server
2016-05-19T15:31:39 <Bosmon> We can put in a hack that ignores failures on the enactors tests
2016-05-19T15:31:52 * alanharnum has quit
2016-05-19T15:32:41 <colinclark> what form will the hack take?
2016-05-19T15:32:52 <Bosmon> I don\'t know
2016-05-19T15:32:58 <Bosmon> It might simply consist of not running them
2016-05-19T15:33:39 <colinclark> ok
2016-05-19T15:36:27 <colinclark> I guess we may have to make a new test runner file for CI
2016-05-19T15:36:31 <colinclark> and then update this file: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/tests/testem.json

2016-05-19T15:53:48 <colinclark> Is there a way to et more verbose logs from QUnit via Testem when tests fail in the Vagrant VM?
2016-05-19T15:58:11 <avtar> colinclark: it\'s been a while since i spent time with testem after the infusion and universal work but i believe when i last looked at that option it meant writing a custom reporter for testem
2016-05-19T15:58:51 <avtar> but we also make use of the tap reporter for the ci reports

2016-05-19T11:00:03 <kasparnet> Bosmon: dood
2016-05-19T11:00:16 <Bosmon> KASPARDNITT!
2016-05-19T11:03:43 <kasparnet> Bosmon: so sorry about introducing all that horror into infusion/the transformation framework
2016-05-19T11:03:57 <Bosmon> Well, it\'s all a bit of a puzzle
2016-05-19T11:04:10 <Bosmon> I guess highlighting how terrible our procedures still are : P
2016-05-19T11:04:16 <kasparnet> Bosmon: do you want me to take a look at FLUID-5907?
2016-05-19T11:04:42 <Bosmon> kasparnet - well I\'ll revert the main change which caused all the tests to fail
2016-05-19T11:05:04 <Bosmon> But it would be helpful if you could think some more about what you were thinking when you made that replacement with fluid.set()
2016-05-19T11:05:10 <Bosmon> The one that there is all the conversation about
2016-05-19T11:05:38 <Bosmon> I *thought* you had explained what the reason was, but now I go back and read the conversation, I can\'t say I can understand what the reason was
2016-05-19T11:05:46 <jhernandez> morning guys
2016-05-19T11:06:17 <jhernandez> Bosmon: I\'ve just created https://github.com/amb26/linux/pull/4 to make your karma happier today
2016-05-19T11:06:20 <jhernandez> :*
2016-05-19T11:06:22 <kasparnet> hey javi
2016-05-19T11:06:49 <Bosmon> Thanks, jhernandez
2016-05-19T11:06:51 <Bosmon> It is looking very good
2016-05-19T11:07:01 <Bosmon> But what do I know, I merge pulls which have failing tests : P
2016-05-19T11:07:29 <jhernandez> xDDDD
2016-05-19T11:07:39 <jhernandez> Bosmon: I\'m sorry for that
2016-05-19T11:07:50 <jhernandez> kasparnet: hey
2016-05-19T11:07:53 <jhernandez> :)
2016-05-19T11:08:19 <kasparnet> Bosmon: but how did it pass the fluid CI?
2016-05-19T11:08:31 <Bosmon> kasparnet - this is what we await avtar to explain when he comes online
2016-05-19T11:09:49 <kasparnet> DRAMA!!!
2016-05-19T11:11:25 <kasparnet> Bosmon: btw, I believe the reason for making that change to fluid.set is that the function wasn\'t previously able to return anything
2016-05-19T11:11:46 <Bosmon> wasn\'t previously able to return anything......
2016-05-19T11:12:04 <kasparnet> ie - the standard contract is that if you dont provide an outputPath, the transform will return the result to its "parent"
2016-05-19T11:12:14 <jhernandez> wrt CI/tests problem, probably I\'m talking nonsense but ... can be that the CI checks the processes\' exit values to evaluate whether tests have failed?
2016-05-19T11:12:30 <kasparnet> ... but for the arrayToSetMembership, it would only ever output to the output model if you gave it a "outputPath"
2016-05-19T11:12:34 <Bosmon> jhernandez - I have no idea how it works
2016-05-19T11:12:41 <Bosmon> I imagine it is actually meant to check for test failures :)
2016-05-19T11:12:49 <jhernandez> haha
2016-05-19T11:13:05 <Bosmon> it would only ever output to the output model if you gave it a "outputPath" ........
2016-05-19T11:13:17 <kasparnet> sec ... let me make an example
2016-05-19T11:13:40 <jhernandez> but if the process finishes well even if it has a fail, then for the CI it\'ll be a "success"
2016-05-19T11:13:58 <Bosmon> jhernandez - it has failed in the past, as you can see in the logs
2016-05-19T11:14:02 <Bosmon> So it is clearly testing something
2016-05-19T11:14:05 <jhernandez> Bosmon: ok ok
2016-05-19T11:15:26 <Bosmon> kasparnet - ok, I think I am starting to understand something again
2016-05-19T11:15:48 <Bosmon> It\'s interesting how hearing you make this explanation makes the words you have written on the pull request start to make sense :)
2016-05-19T11:16:00 <kasparnet> hehe yeah
2016-05-19T11:16:15 <Bosmon> Ok
2016-05-19T11:16:15 <kasparnet> I\'ll excuse my bad explanations with "language barrier" :D
2016-05-19T11:16:27 <Bosmon> This suggests that your change is responsible for both problems
2016-05-19T11:16:33 <kasparnet> goddammit
2016-05-19T11:16:39 <kasparnet> did I just make things even worse for myself
2016-05-19T11:16:42 <kasparnet> ... crap
2016-05-19T11:16:56 <Bosmon> That is, the fact that all our instances of "fluid.transforms.arrayToSetMembership" which have no "outputPath" written in mysteriously stopped working
2016-05-19T11:17:33 <Bosmon> or no "inputPath"
2016-05-19T11:17:58 <kasparnet> I understand why the ones with no outputPath have stopped working
2016-05-19T11:18:10 <kasparnet> but I dont understand why the ones with no inputPath every worked
2016-05-19T11:18:21 <Bosmon> I had assumed that my FLUID-5867 changes had broken that, but I hadn\'t yet succeeded in understanding how
2016-05-19T11:18:21 <kasparnet> cause the transform has always been a standardInput one
2016-05-19T11:18:42 <Bosmon> Well, perhaps you broke the ones with no outputPath and I broke the ones with no inputPath :)
2016-05-19T11:19:03 <kasparnet> hehe
2016-05-19T11:19:17 <Bosmon> But it seems a strange coincidence that all the ones that broke were of type fluid.transforms.arrayToSetMembership or fluid.transforms.setMembershipToArray
2016-05-19T11:19:33 <kasparnet> it does!
2016-05-19T11:20:18 <Bosmon> It\'s quite an awkward question: What did the author MEAN when they wrote a transform which is standardInput but has neither "input" nor "inputPath" set?
2016-05-19T11:20:39 <Bosmon> Our old behaviour was to assume they had meant to write an inputPath of ""
2016-05-19T11:20:49 <Bosmon> But this is quite rubbish, and will not make sense in our "new world"
2016-05-19T11:21:09 <Bosmon> That is, where we don\'t always have an implicit "document" but expect things to be IoC-qualified
2016-05-19T11:21:24 <kasparnet> yeah
2016-05-19T11:21:43 <Bosmon> I mean, in a world where we mean to completely abolish "xxxxPath", it seems a bit crazy to have a default behaviour which depends on it
2016-05-19T11:22:21 <Bosmon> So this suggests that the current behaviour in trunk (minus the escaping issues and failing tests" is the one we want, and that we might even want to go futher
2016-05-19T11:22:28 <Bosmon> And explicitly fail a transform which has neither input nor inputPath
2016-05-19T11:22:47 <Bosmon> That is a standardInput one
2016-05-19T11:23:06 <Bosmon> I mean it\'s ok if it has an input which evaluates to undefined
2016-05-19T11:23:14 <Bosmon> But it\'s not ok if the user didn\'t even try to write any input at all
2016-05-19T11:23:14 <kasparnet> yeah
2016-05-19T11:23:27 <kasparnet> that makes sense to me
2016-05-19T11:23:32 <Bosmon> I mean there is that long-standing comment there
2016-05-19T11:23:41 <Bosmon> That presumably I wrote 4 years ago
2016-05-19T11:23:53 <Bosmon> "// NB: We may one day want to reverse the crazy jQuery-like convention that "no path means root path""
2016-05-19T11:23:58 <Bosmon> So perhaps this day has come
2016-05-19T11:24:07 <Bosmon> But we still have to finish the task of understanding exactly what happened
2016-05-19T11:24:46 * kasparnet is just reading through FLUID-5907 again
2016-05-19T11:29:37 <Bosmon> Given we\'ve completely fucked up all the transforms in universal we may as well finish the job : P
2016-05-19T11:31:38 <kasparnet> Bosmon: I think this might explain part of the weirdness with setMembershipToArray
2016-05-19T11:31:40 <kasparnet> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/701/files#diff-b850758894970110e0af05626affc2e7L413
2016-05-19T11:32:07 <kasparnet> I\'ve changed it to a standardInputTransform function instead of a custom input one
2016-05-19T11:32:30 <kasparnet> which would cause it to just stop on no inputPath/input and return undefined
2016-05-19T11:47:08 <Bosmon> kasparnet - ok, so that was it
2016-05-19T11:47:32 <Bosmon> And we just happened to write a lot of transforms in the solutions registry which depended on it being nonstandard
2016-05-19T11:47:32 <kasparnet> Bosmon: cool
2016-05-19T11:47:48 <kasparnet> Bosmon: hehe typical
2016-05-19T11:58:55 <Bosmon> kasparnet - if you have a spare moment, perhaps you could check out the Ontology Handler web tests in my current branch
2016-05-19T11:59:20 <Bosmon> A lot of them are failing, with respect to expecting "undefined" and instead receiving {} or various variations on that theme
2016-05-19T11:59:39 <kasparnet> sure
2016-05-19T11:59:47 <kasparnet> GPII-1318 still?
2016-05-19T11:59:52 <Bosmon> The failure seemed similar in structure to the one caused by the change in the ModelTransformationTests testOneTransform driver, but the handler doesn\'t use that
2016-05-19T11:59:56 <Bosmon> Yes, that one
2016-05-19T12:00:01 <kasparnet> ok
2016-05-19T12:00:04 <Bosmon> Cheers

2016-05-19T12:17:37 * gtirloni joined the channel
2016-05-19T12:22:22 <kasparnet> Bosmon: are you looking at the transformer web tests, or should I take a look at those as well
2016-05-19T12:23:49 <Bosmon> kasparnet - please look at those too
2016-05-19T12:23:56 <Bosmon> Do you see the failures?
2016-05-19T12:24:19 <kasparnet> yeah - and I fixed the ontology handler ones - but it escapes me how it ever worked... just looking at the GPII-1318 diff now
2016-05-19T12:26:17 * Justin_o joined the channel
2016-05-19T12:32:05 <kasparnet> Bosmon: ok - figured out the fail
2016-05-19T12:32:13 <Bosmon> kasparnet - great
2016-05-19T12:32:15 <Bosmon> What is it?
2016-05-19T12:32:16 <kasparnet> so apparently the issue is with jqunit
2016-05-19T12:32:21 <Bosmon> Oh yes
2016-05-19T12:32:23 <Bosmon> It got fixed
2016-05-19T12:32:28 <kasparnet> where an assertDeepEq(undefined, {}) would be true
2016-05-19T12:32:31 <Bosmon> Were all those broken tests relying on the broken assertDeepEq?
2016-05-19T12:32:32 <Bosmon> Ok
2016-05-19T12:32:46 <kasparnet> so I\'ve modified the code to result in {}
2016-05-19T12:32:54 <Bosmon> Sorry, I should have considered that as the first possibility
2016-05-19T12:32:58 <Bosmon> But I had got quite confused last night
2016-05-19T12:33:01 <kasparnet> and haven\'t changed the assert
2016-05-19T12:33:04 <kasparnet> no worried at all
2016-05-19T12:33:13 <kasparnet> I\'m happy to help out
2016-05-19T12:33:20 <kasparnet> worries*
