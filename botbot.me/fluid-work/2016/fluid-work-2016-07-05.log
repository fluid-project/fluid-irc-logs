2016-07-05T15:09:27 <Godfrey_> jhung, colinclark: As one of our projects, Tim and I were thinking of looking through the IDRC handbook, bringing an occupational/clinical lens.

Right now there\'s a lot of info so if there\'s a suggestion on how it might be organized that would be great. Also addressing the rationale is a great idea!

2016-07-05T16:18:52 <clown> aside:  there is lovely catch-22 here:  Windows says it can\'t start edge unless you turn this thing on.  There is a link inside the control to get more info about the settings.  Click the link, and nothing happens.  I assume it\'s becaue Edge can\'t start...

2016-07-05T16:46:36 <clown> avtar, yes thanks.  <rhetorical>does this mean we don\'t test gpii with edge?</rhetorical>
2016-07-05T16:47:55 <colinclark> Given that the GPII doesn\'t currently have any specifically client-side components, clown, that\'s a reasonable tradeoff at this poitn
2016-07-05T16:48:10 <colinclark> especially since it appears that it\'s even very challenging just to lauch Edge with testem :P
2016-07-05T16:48:28 <clown> colinclark, I see.
2016-07-05T16:48:51 <colinclark> The tests we do run in browsers are mostly just a means of testing components that, in practice, run inside Node.js, but are easier to test in a browser
2016-07-05T16:49:15 <colinclark> clown: But won\'t it be great when we can ditch IE11 from everywhere and only test on Edge? :)
2016-07-05T16:49:30 <clown> colinclark, indeed.

2016-07-05T17:00:59 <gloob> but without our provisioning
2016-07-05T17:01:13 <gloob> so if you don\'t mind to launch the provisioning stuff by hand

2016-07-05T18:08:01 <simonjb> cindyli: it\'s a good question. I\'m not sure the best thing here. Yesterday I read over the UX document on accounts and there is no mention of privacy settings.

2016-07-05T18:25:34 <bens__> gloob, I just commented on https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-1873. I was looking at that unit test behavior as well and basically found the same thing as you did

2016-07-05T18:59:33 <gloob> bens__: it\'s getting harder, do you think your new implementation will fix the problem?
2016-07-05T19:00:20 <gloob> or it\'s just a windows API "feature"?
2016-07-05T19:00:57 <gloob> Although Windows will report an initial high contrast default theme
2016-07-05T19:00:57 <gloob> value of "" (empty string) it is not possible to programmatically set the
2016-07-05T19:00:58 <gloob> theme value to "" once it has been set to any other value.
2016-07-05T19:01:04 <gloob> are we sure about this?
2016-07-05T19:01:21 <bens__> I think its a "feature" but i\'m trying to build some .net drivers to test many cases of this
2016-07-05T19:01:26 <gloob> great
2016-07-05T19:01:39 <gloob> it\'s worth to test from the .net side
2016-07-05T19:01:48 <gloob> bens__: thanks, awesome!
2016-07-05T19:01:55 <bens__> gloob, fairly sure, but thats one of the tests i\'m workin on the .net side
2016-07-05T19:02:19 <bens__> win 7 behaves the same (initial value is empty string until it has been set)
2016-07-05T19:02:26 <gloob> I guess, just guess, that somehow that tests will remain in the javascript part anyway
2016-07-05T19:02:46 <gloob> so, they used it as default?
2016-07-05T19:03:27 <gloob> I\'m going to push also today my PR with the fixes for 32/64 bits bugs in node-ffi, maybe it\'s useful for you too
2016-07-05T19:03:51 <gloob> bens__: in fact the other day I wanted to ask you about that, 32/64 bits in .net/edge is solved out of the box?
2016-07-05T19:04:55 * gabrielm_ has quit
2016-07-05T19:06:10 <bens__> gloob, that is the idea but i haven\'t proven it yet. there is a type called IntPtr in .net that magically is a pointer of the correct size that should smooth things over
2016-07-05T19:07:05 <bens__> there will still be marshalling, but it will be mostly between c#.net and c++ of the windows api which can take advantage of IntPtr and .net features
2016-07-05T19:07:15 <gloob> I also saw the universal like dlls of the .net fragments too
2016-07-05T19:07:32 <gloob> great, that should be where it remains
2016-07-05T19:07:44 <bens__> and passing data between node/edge and .net will be json which works pretty well so far. no big gotchas there I think
2016-07-05T19:09:27 <bens__> gloob, can you link me to your PR for 32/64 bit fixes? Is it related to killing processes?
2016-07-05T19:09:49 <gloob> yes
2016-07-05T19:09:57 <gloob> give me 15 minutes
2016-07-05T19:10:13 <bens__> i\'m thinking maybe i can use that to set up the equivalent test using edge/.net
2016-07-05T19:10:17 <bens__> sure, thank yoU!

2016-07-05T14:13:55 <michelled> Justin_o: did I just see the tooltip pull get in!
2016-07-05T14:13:57 <Bosmon> Brilliant, cindyli - thanks!
2016-07-05T14:14:15 <Bosmon> This wasn't tooltips, it was the native slider widget
2016-07-05T14:14:50 <michelled> has UIO been changed to only load one Infusion version?
2016-07-05T14:15:36 <Justin_o> michelled: well you have the option of using native or jQuery UI sliders.. and using the native should remove the need for JS in the iframe
2016-07-05T14:16:34 <michelled> Justin_o: do we have an example of this?
2016-07-05T14:17:13 <Justin_o> the demos use the native sliders
2016-07-05T14:17:16 <Justin_o> michelled: ^
2016-07-05T14:17:32 <Justin_o> there are examples and manual tests that show both versions
2016-07-05T14:18:47 <michelled> cool! thx

2016-07-05T14:45:11 <Justin_o> cindyli: I have another one for you to look at.. should be quick though https://github.com/fluid-project/build.fluidproject.org/pull/19
2016-07-05T14:45:20 <Justin_o> it's to update the build site with the new manual tests
2016-07-05T14:45:26 <cindyli> ok, Justin_o
2016-07-05T14:49:40 <Justin_o> cindyli: i made the change you suggested
2016-07-05T14:49:50 <cindyli> thanks, Justin_o
2016-07-05T14:54:48 <cindyli> Justin_o: i think there's probably a bug with the native slider. if you open uiOptions demo, move one or two native sliders to a value in btw such as 1.4, click hide to close the UIO panel, then click show to open the panel, the slider handlebar is not at 1.4 position, it's either at the start or at the end of the slider
2016-07-05T14:55:13 <Justin_o> :(
2016-07-05T14:57:47 <jhung> cindyli: styki pushed up code to his branch. It's looks pretty good now. Do you want to meet to talk it over some time?
