2016-08-16T19:22:34 <Justin_o> jhung: that makes sense
2016-08-16T19:22:59 <Justin_o> jhung: does it make sense to include the js directly in the infusion-docs repo, or do you think it should be sourced from another repo entirely
2016-08-16T19:23:25 <Justin_o> i\'m leaning towards keeping it all under the same repo, especially because i think this is a rare case, but could be convinced either way
2016-08-16T19:42:15 <Justin_o> jhung: by the way, i just noticed that if you run a page through https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/ it gives you the option to download the optimized assets..
2016-08-16T19:42:40 <Justin_o> not sure it\'s useful for the JS and CSS as we should have proper build tools for this, but could help with the image optimization if you don\'t have something for that already
2016-08-16T19:43:20 <jhung> Justin_o: for now it\'s easiest to keep it all in the same repo.
2016-08-16T19:43:52 <Justin_o> alanharnum, bens__: do you know of a good resource explaining the different types of optimizations you could implement for a website
2016-08-16T19:44:55 <bens__> Justin_o, https://developers.google.com/speed/
2016-08-16T19:45:36 <bens__> Justin_o, there are a lot of tools available linked there that will scan and make recommendations. and then for just general reading you can check here: https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/rules
2016-08-16T19:45:54 <Justin_o> bens__: excellent thanks
2016-08-16T19:46:39 <bens__> Justin_o, also for more indepth items: https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/?hl=en
2016-08-16T19:47:28 <alanharnum> what bens__ said
2016-08-16T19:47:39 <gloob> google
2016-08-16T19:47:39 <alanharnum> Google is probably the best relatively neutral resource for this
2016-08-16T19:47:49 <gloob> well, neutral hihi
2016-08-16T19:47:57 <alanharnum> i said "relatively" :)
2016-08-16T19:48:01 <gloob> gotcha
2016-08-16T19:48:05 <gloob> ;)
2016-08-16T19:48:27 <alanharnum> this article is a decent overview if you ignore the "BUY OUR CDN SERVICES" stuff: https://www.maxcdn.com/blog/frontend-optimizations/
2016-08-16T19:49:12 <alanharnum> and this Smashing article is a good in-depth case study: https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/09/improving-smashing-magazine-performance-case-study/
2016-08-16T19:50:48 <bens__> that url containing "frontend-optimizations" is rather interesting. you could probably split website performance optimization into a couple of big buckets with backend, over the wire, and front end
2016-08-16T19:51:59 <bens__> each of which you could go very deep into the rabbit hole. Justin_o do you have a guess which bucket you\'re most interested with?
2016-08-16T19:55:47 <Justin_o> bens__: not really.. i\'m writing up a tutorial about a particular configuration of a preferences server that could be used in cases where page load speeds are highly critical. I wanted to make mention of other optimizations that could be done along side or instead of this
2016-08-16T19:55:53 <Justin_o> alanharnum: thanks for the links
2016-08-16T19:57:07 <alanharnum> bens__: yeah when I think of "optimization" it tends to be mostly in terms of front end, but i agree about the buckets
2016-08-16T19:57:44 <Justin_o> bens__: mind if i use your buckets for my tutorial?
2016-08-16T19:58:08 <bens__> Justin_o, of course!
2016-08-16T19:58:16 <Justin_o> thanks :)
2016-08-16T20:00:21 <bens__> alanharnum, i think these days front end gets a lot more attention (the attention it deserves) whereas even a couple years back it was all about back end and wire time
2016-08-16T20:01:02 <alanharnum> bens__: yeah - there\'s a much better general sense of how to measure those
2016-08-16T20:01:28 <alanharnum> in the sense of "how long does it take before the HTML is delivered to the browser"
2016-08-16T20:01:56 <alanharnum> front end optimizations with modern sites get you into all kinds of gnarliness about real speed vs. perceived speed, cognitive psychology of what "fast" means for users, etc etc
2016-08-16T20:04:54 <Justin_o> alanharnum: that\'s a good point.. i was looking at the throttling feature in the chrome dev tools the other day.
2016-08-16T20:05:19 <alanharnum> and all the AJAXy / websockets / etc things that are hard to measure outside the context of a particular browser
2016-08-16T20:05:48 * yzen_ joined the channel
2016-08-16T20:05:50 <Justin_o> It occurred to me that if we employ lazy loading, on a fast connection it my flash the change, on a slow site it might appear over time.. but if everything is loading slowly anyways, they may not notice that as much as someone on a fast connection where it flashes at them
2016-08-16T20:06:35 <bens__> alanharnum, yes! lots of perf testing tools "add up" time for downloading all... resources.. even things lazily loaded. Without the context of a browser experience you think your load times are sky high

2016-08-16T20:09:44 <bens__> Justin_o, do you have an example URL? it kind of sounds like there is a page that has to load enough to figure out it needs to make a request to the prefs server and then enact the prefs it receives.. thus the fast response from the prefs server?
2016-08-16T20:13:44 <Justin_o> bens__: not per se, but i have been playing around with a lazy loading strategy that you can see examples of here https://cdn.rawgit.com/jobara/prefsFramework-optimization-examples/debd1f6ac6da992b9368bd144d0e97c879331f21/index.html
2016-08-16T20:14:11 <Justin_o> Here\'s one of the particular examples https://cdn.rawgit.com/jobara/prefsFramework-optimization-examples/debd1f6ac6da992b9368bd144d0e97c879331f21/enhancer/lazyLoad-grade/custom-minified/prefsEditor/index.html
2016-08-16T20:14:12 <alanharnum> bens__: yeah, I know this is an overused phrasing, but front-end optimization is at least as much art as science
2016-08-16T20:14:21 <Justin_o> not sure how well it loads over the CDN though
2016-08-16T20:15:54 <alanharnum> if you really want to get deep into this it turns out this is available online for free: https://hpbn.co/

2016-08-16T15:27:40 <colinclark> our own Justin_o is a very eagle-eyed reader of the GPII commits list
2016-08-16T15:28:19 * danayo has quit
2016-08-16T15:28:42 <colinclark> and he was puzzled by these two: http://lists.idrc.ocad.ca/pipermail/commits/2016-August/007126.html and http://lists.idrc.ocad.ca/pipermail/commits/2016-August/007127.html
2016-08-16T15:28:55 <colinclark> I was confused
2016-08-16T15:29:11 <colinclark> but I guess if you push a branch to "upstream," this will trigger a commit notification?
2016-08-16T15:30:12 * danayo joined the channel
2016-08-16T15:31:07 <kasparnet> yeah, colinclark, I somehow managed to clone the repo directly from GPII with git@github.com (ie. write access) - so when thinking I was pushing a branch to my local repo (ie. origin) I was actually pushing it to the GPII org
2016-08-16T15:31:22 <kasparnet> I deleted the branch straight away from the org
2016-08-16T15:31:36 <colinclark> aha, yes
2016-08-16T15:31:41 <kasparnet> and modified my remotes so origin is pointing at my own, and upstream is GPII
2016-08-16T15:31:41 <colinclark> I always worry about doing this
2016-08-16T15:31:45 <colinclark> easily done
2016-08-16T15:31:51 <colinclark> so how did you remove the branch?
2016-08-16T15:32:05 <kasparnet> yeah - I\'m totally paranoid about it as well - but somehow I missed it this time
2016-08-16T15:32:48 <kasparnet> just a "git push upstream :GPII-1955" will delete a GPII-1955 branch
2016-08-16T15:32:55 <kasparnet> i.e. prefix with a ":"
2016-08-16T15:34:41 <colinclark> aha
2016-08-16T15:34:44 <colinclark> makes sense
2016-08-16T15:35:01 <colinclark> thanks for clarifying

2016-08-16T17:49:29 <jhung> sure Justin_o
2016-08-16T17:49:40 <Justin_o> if i want to write a tutorial that comes with a js file for someone to download, where should i put that js file
2016-08-16T17:49:52 <Justin_o> specifically this would be for the infusion docs
2016-08-16T17:50:03 <Justin_o> jhung: ^
2016-08-16T17:51:45 <jhung> So you want to create an infusion doc with a link to a JS file. You\'re wondering where to put that JS file Justin_o?
2016-08-16T17:51:56 <Justin_o> yes
2016-08-16T17:53:22 <jhung> You\'d probably put it in the ./src/static/ directory. Probably in a sub directory called "examples" so it doesn\'t get confused for JS that\'s used for the site.
