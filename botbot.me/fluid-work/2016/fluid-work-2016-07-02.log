2016-07-02T01:17:18 <wannabeCitizen> Bosmon: if I have a modelRelay set up between both components, do I still need to state an explicit model block in both components or can I anticipate the bound values to be there w/o explicit declaration?
2016-07-02T01:18:11 <wannabeCitizen> (I should have better said, \xe2\x80\x9cbetween two components\xe2\x80\x9d at the beginning of that sentence)

2016-07-02T01:39:23 <wannabeCitizen> Ammended to the above question I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if it\xe2\x80\x99s good practice to expect a modelRelay rule to have updated a model immediately on creation so as to be safe to assume the model will be updated to be used in an onCreate event.
