2016-06-09T15:20:24 <avtar> colinclark: just checking with gtirloni, the only thing that was done was ci-int.gpii.net access for the ocad ip address was allowed a few minutes ago
2016-06-09T15:21:14 <colinclark> Did I break it? :)
2016-06-09T15:21:31 <gtirloni> i disabled the update script again, something might have changed in the jenkins UI in v2.8.. i'll have to investigate this later. modsecurity will let us disable this script hopefully
2016-06-09T15:22:40 <gtirloni> anonymous users do not have the ability to start jobs.. so that's puzzling
2016-06-09T15:23:32 <colinclark> gtirloni: What are the blockers at this point?
2016-06-09T15:23:41 <colinclark> amatas is going to work with Sandra to buy some stuff, right?
2016-06-09T15:23:49 <avtar> gtirloni: yeah that was the firs thitng i checked as well
2016-06-09T15:24:02 <gtirloni> yes, but that's just for the commercial rules. we're able to start working on it without them for now
2016-06-09T15:24:03 <avtar> *first thing
2016-06-09T15:25:45 <amatas> right colinclark , I'll talk with Sandra about to purchase a modsecurity license

2016-06-09T15:52:34 <gtirloni> i have to leave the meeting for a moment. do you guys think we might be wrapping it up soon? asking just so i don't miss the final goodbyes :)

2016-06-09T16:25:26 <Dinuka> This is regarding my project
2016-06-09T16:25:41 <simonjb`> hi Dinuka
2016-06-09T16:25:51 <Dinuka> I thought of adding d3.js into my project
2016-06-09T16:26:24 <Dinuka> since it makes the svg manipulations more easier
2016-06-09T16:26:46 <Dinuka> would that be a good option
2016-06-09T16:28:01 <simonjb`> Dinuka: I have not used d3.js myself but I know alanharnum has had good experience with it
2016-06-09T16:28:39 <alanharnum> Dinuka: we use D3 for this project: https://github.com/fluid-project/chartAuthoring

2016-06-09T16:29:19 <alanharnum> depending on what exactly you're doing http://snapsvg.io/ might also be an option - I've liked the look of it but haven't done anything significant with it
