2016-05-30T17:31:34 <PaliwalSparsh> Justin_o: What would I need to do to override the properties and functions of the grade that I have inherited from. Like in the parent grade there was a selector gameCanvas, it had some default value, how would I override this in the component that inherits from it.
2016-05-30T17:32:32 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: you\'d just set a new value in the component that uses the parent grade
2016-05-30T17:33:26 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: do you know what I mean by that?
2016-05-30T17:34:09 <PaliwalSparsh> like I would directly do selectors: { gameCanvas: ".newValue" }
2016-05-30T17:34:31 <Justin_o> yes
2016-05-30T17:34:40 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: ^
2016-05-30T17:35:21 <PaliwalSparsh> ok Justin I will try and let you know.
2016-05-30T17:35:51 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: yes, please let me know if you have any troubles getting it working
2016-05-30T17:36:16 <PaliwalSparsh> Justin_o surely
2016-05-30T17:39:22 * colinclark joined the channel
2016-05-30T17:44:41 <PaliwalSparsh> Justin_o : in the parent it is, selectors: { gameCanvas: "#gameCanvas" } and in the child one I did, selectors: { gameCanvas: "#newName" }. I tried it, it was not working so I attached a console.log(that.locate(\'gameCanvas\').selectorName); to the listener of onCreate of the parent grade and run it to see if it was taking the new selector found out it was still showing "gameCanvas" in the console and not "newName".
2016-05-30T17:45:59 <PaliwalSparsh> Could this behaviour of console.log maybe because onCreate is run when parent grade is created and at that time gameCanvas\'s value is #gameCanvas only.
2016-05-30T17:47:28 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: hmm.. i don\'t think so, it should be merging all of the options together before the onCreate even is ever fired
2016-05-30T17:47:40 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: do you have this code pushed up somewhere, i could try it out
2016-05-30T17:47:55 <PaliwalSparsh> ok Justin_o I will push and send the link.
2016-05-30T17:48:09 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: thanks

2016-05-30T19:21:24 <PaliwalSparsh> Justin_o: Also wanted to tell you I looked into the phaser docs to see if I can use the class for selector, it specified that either ID or the name of element string (p, div, ul etc.) should be used.
2016-05-30T19:23:08 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: can you send me a link to that
2016-05-30T19:23:23 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: also i think your code is fine, but you are looking at the wrong thing in the console log
2016-05-30T19:23:58 <Justin_o> it does seem to be picking up the correct element, the selectorName appears to be the actual name you\'ve defined for the selector
2016-05-30T19:24:19 <Justin_o> what I think you probably meant to look at was that.locate("gameCanvas").selector
2016-05-30T19:26:16 <PaliwalSparsh> Justin_o: here in this link Please look at the parent parameter
2016-05-30T19:26:17 <PaliwalSparsh> http://phaser.io/docs/2.4.7/Phaser.Game.html
2016-05-30T19:28:02 <PaliwalSparsh> Actually I console.log(that.locate("gameCanvas") and found out that it had these properties -
2016-05-30T19:29:19 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: great
2016-05-30T19:29:31 <PaliwalSparsh> of which one was selector and selector Name
2016-05-30T19:29:40 <PaliwalSparsh> Justin_o you are correct
2016-05-30T19:29:48 * cindyli has quit
2016-05-30T19:29:59 <PaliwalSparsh> somehow it is showing selector as .gameWindow #newName
2016-05-30T19:30:13 <PaliwalSparsh> and selectorName as gameCanvas
2016-05-30T19:30:14 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: that\'s correct, because it\'s scoped to the components container
2016-05-30T19:31:26 * amatas joined the channel
2016-05-30T19:31:30 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: In regards to your Phaser.io comment about ID or element being used as the parent. I think you should just pass in the element directly.
2016-05-30T19:33:00 <Justin_o> so instead of doing that.locate("gameCanvas").selectorName, you could do that.locate("gameCanvas")[0]
2016-05-30T19:34:11 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: and if you aren\'t expecting to have anything else go into the markup of the component container other than the canvas, you could just use the components container... so something like that.container[0]
2016-05-30T19:35:16 <PaliwalSparsh> Justin_o certainly binding it to the container is also seems to be a good idea.
2016-05-30T19:35:56 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: did you have any other questions, comments, or issues?
2016-05-30T19:36:22 <PaliwalSparsh> I guess the problem was this only .selectorName returns the the key of this not the value.... gameCanvas: "#newName"
2016-05-30T19:36:31 <PaliwalSparsh> No Justin_o thanks for all the help
2016-05-30T19:36:39 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: yes, i think that was the only issue
2016-05-30T19:36:48 <Justin_o> or the issue at least

2016-05-30T12:30:45 <PaliwalSparsh> When i do this and instantiate fluid.phaser.game.discoveryCat() ,error comes saying fluid.phaser.game.discoveryCat function does not exists.
2016-05-30T12:31:26 * kasparnet has quit
2016-05-30T12:32:18 <PaliwalSparsh> usually a creator function is created when we create a grade, so why does here it says that function does not exist?
2016-05-30T12:33:10 <Justin_o> i think i\'ll need to see the rest of the code including how you are trying to instantiate fluid.phaser.game.discoeryCat
2016-05-30T12:33:56 <PaliwalSparsh> ok I will push it to a branch and will forward the link

2016-05-30T12:46:37 <Justin_o> okay.. see it
2016-05-30T12:48:35 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: It appears that fluid.phaser.game.discoveryCats is a viewComponent. However you have not passed in a container for it when initializing. https://github.com/PaliwalSparsh/Discovery-Cat/blob/langpref/demo/index.html#L17
2016-05-30T12:48:45 * kasparnet joined the channel
2016-05-30T12:49:55 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: also I\'d suggest not using IDs for selectors. https://github.com/PaliwalSparsh/Discovery-Cat/blob/langpref/demo/js/game.js#L6
2016-05-30T12:50:31 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: and you should be namespacing your class names (and IDs if needed). This is how we do it in Infusion https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/docs/Class+Name+Conventions

2016-05-30T14:35:46 <jhung> Justin_o: excellent!
2016-05-30T14:37:54 <Justin_o> However, slide your finger around the screen discover mode doesn\'t work well
2016-05-30T14:38:11 <Justin_o> because of the positioning of the accessible peers in the top corner
2016-05-30T14:38:21 <Justin_o> i\'m not sure how important it is to support this though
2016-05-30T14:38:29 <Justin_o> any thoughts?
2016-05-30T14:40:15 <jhung> discover mode is pretty important Justin_o. It\'ll probably be the "default" method of figuring out what the sim is on first load.
2016-05-30T14:42:25 <alanharnum> colinclark: i did a bunch more diagnostics on the issue I\'m seeing with Flocking in the chartAuthoring code under the newest infusion: https://github.com/fluid-project/chartAuthoring/pull/14#discussion_r65078668
2016-05-30T14:43:00 <Justin_o> hmm.. that could be problematic
2016-05-30T14:43:07 <Justin_o> jhung: ^
2016-05-30T14:43:08 <colinclark> alanharnum: I\'ll have a look
2016-05-30T14:43:14 <alanharnum> seem to have isolated the cause to those lines
2016-05-30T14:43:27 <jhung> Justin_o: give me a sec and let\'s chat about this over Vidyo
2016-05-30T14:43:59 <colinclark> alanharnum: Just glancing at the issue, are you using an old version of Flocking?
2016-05-30T14:44:03 <Justin_o> jhung: okay
2016-05-30T14:44:08 <Justin_o> call me when you\'re ready
2016-05-30T14:44:23 <alanharnum> colinclark: it\'s possible, just thought the same thing myself - I\'d thought it was using the version you recommended it be pinned to
2016-05-30T14:44:39 <alanharnum> but I see what\'s in my code is different the latest
2016-05-30T14:45:45 <alanharnum> let me try with latest, since I see you pushed this on the weekend: https://github.com/colinbdclark/Flocking/commit/b0c06d0de44ce969fec95c4a018d604454b45163
2016-05-30T14:48:07 <alanharnum> colinclark: OK, that fixed it - I think this was my own fault for not making sure the dependencies were up to date
2016-05-30T14:48:09 <alanharnum> thanks!
2016-05-30T14:48:44 <colinclark> So which version were you pinned against, and which are now using?
2016-05-30T14:49:24 <alanharnum> was pinned at https://github.com/colinbdclark/Flocking/commit/543b339f8aac1c10bffc5e70344f56bc63cc25b1
2016-05-30T14:49:30 <alanharnum> am now using https://github.com/colinbdclark/Flocking/commit/b0c06d0de44ce969fec95c4a018d604454b45163
2016-05-30T14:49:47 <alanharnum> but i think I might have also failed to run the necessary step to update the front-end dependencies after running npm install
2016-05-30T14:50:22 <colinclark> yeah, sound slike
2016-05-30T14:50:35 <colinclark> since the bug you reference was fixed at 543b339f8aac1c10bffc5e70344f56bc63cc25b1
2016-05-30T14:50:43 <colinclark> so it would have worked fine for you, I think
2016-05-30T14:51:12 * alanharnum is adding a postinstall hook to package.json right now to avoid the manual 2nd step
2016-05-30T14:51:20 <colinclark> makes sense

2016-05-30T15:03:03 <colinclark> I don\'t think Lerna will do builds, no
