2016-02-15T18:32:44 <simonjb> hey Bosmon
2016-02-15T18:40:51 <Bosmon> Hey there simonjb
2016-02-15T18:40:55 <Bosmon> Aren't you on holiday? :)
2016-02-15T18:41:00 <simonjb> yep
2016-02-15T18:41:27 <Bosmon> Ah, I got some slides from you
2016-02-15T18:41:28 <simonjb> I'm working on getting everything ready for the P4A face-to-face
2016-02-15T18:41:55 <simonjb> I'd love to get your feedback on the slides, Bosmon, particularly number 4
2016-02-15T18:42:04 <Bosmon> Thanks, I'll take a look
2016-02-15T18:42:09 <simonjb> I'm not super happy with that one
2016-02-15T18:42:12 <simonjb> thanks!
2016-02-15T18:42:14 <Bosmon> Thanks so much for putting all this together, by the way
2016-02-15T18:42:53 <simonjb> it's going to be challenging saying everything in 5 mins but I just need to practice it until it comes off smoothly
2016-02-15T18:43:55 <simonjb> there will be other times to talk more I hope so I think it's ok if my have extra stuff that I can move to the end of the presentation
2016-02-15T19:21:31 <avtar> hey simonjb
2016-02-15T19:21:36 <avtar> what's your ip?
