2016-06-16T23:59:06 <gtirloni> yeah, it's about time
2016-06-16T23:59:06 <gloob> are you not good?
2016-06-16T23:59:07 <gloob> xD
2016-06-16T23:59:19 <avtar> i'll be good too
2016-06-16T23:59:21 <avtar> but after dinner
2016-06-16T23:59:22 <gloob> lets test the last spin
2016-06-16T23:59:28 <avtar> agreed
2016-06-16T23:59:35 <gloob> and pack
2016-06-16T23:59:38 <gloob> dinner?
2016-06-16T23:59:47 <gloob> 20:00
2016-06-16T23:59:54 <avtar> gloob: i thought we agreed that you're buying me dinner?
2016-06-16T23:59:56 <gloob> so early for spaniard standard
"

b'2016-06-16T20:34:58 <alanharnum> i\'m going to revise my prior comment about knowing enough about model-based programming at time of implementation to have a reason for doing it indirectly via the DOM :p
2016-06-16T20:41:08 <gloob> avtar: any difference?
2016-06-16T20:43:59 <avtar> gloob: no
2016-06-16T20:44:07 <avtar> unit tests are hanging
2016-06-16T20:44:33 <avtar> gloob: 13:24:47.802:  jq: FAIL: Module "gpii.tests.windows.killProcess" Test name "Testing Killing Processes" - Message: Assertion failure (see console.log for expanded message): Failed to find process executing

2016-06-16T20:47:03 <gloob> yes
2016-06-16T20:47:14 <gloob> are we running current code?
2016-06-16T20:47:23 <gloob> because it looks like old problem
2016-06-16T20:47:57 <avtar> gloob: yeah that\'s what i checked first
2016-06-16T20:48:01 <gloob> when the test runner cannot kill putty it get freezed in that point, there isn\'t timeout or similar thing
2016-06-16T20:48:18 <avtar> e321e401741c0246d4c3e997265c13f38177054b is the most recent commit
2016-06-16T20:48:38 <gloob> and is it node32?
2016-06-16T20:50:22 <gloob> ==> default:  Downloading nodejs.install 32 bit
2016-06-16T20:50:33 <gloob> in the provisioning log looks good
2016-06-16T20:50:37 <gloob> pretty weird
2016-06-16T20:50:41 <avtar> yeah
2016-06-16T20:50:50 <avtar> a bit frustrating tbh
2016-06-16T20:51:09 <gloob> could I mimic the jenkins process in my machine?
2016-06-16T20:52:05 <avtar> the best way would be to use alfredo\'s work to set up a jenkins server and build node
2016-06-16T20:52:22 <gloob> ok, I will talk with him
2016-06-16T20:52:29 <gloob> dinner time

2016-06-16T23:06:58 <jhernandez_> avtar: ok, let us know how it goes
2016-06-16T23:07:18 <avtar> jhernandez_: this was the last run:

2016-06-16T23:10:58 <jhernandez_> xDD
2016-06-16T23:11:17 <avtar> that is very apt
2016-06-16T23:11:21 <avtar> :P
2016-06-16T23:12:02 <avtar> creating a new box on my machine and waiting for jenkins to do the same
2016-06-16T23:12:49 <gtirloni> 15:34:44.850:  jq: FAIL: Module "gpii.tests.acceptance.windows.builtIn.config tests" Test name "Testing os_win7 using Flat matchmaker" - Message: Checking that settings are set - at sequence position 8 of 19
2016-06-16T23:13:00 <gtirloni> the expected and actual output are being truncated :/

2016-06-16T23:13:22 <gtirloni> does anyone know the easiest way to change that and where?
2016-06-16T23:14:46 <gtirloni> something in here seems to be failing to be set properly: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/60bfcb9ec35f12de231bc207e2fa25656ddb8949/tests/platform/windows/windows-builtIn-testSpec.js#L25-L136
2016-06-16T23:29:22 <gloob> I don\'t know, it\'s supoosed to exists a console.log file
2016-06-16T23:32:23 <avtar> jhernandez_, gloob, gtirloni: i just tried the tests on a freshly created vm on my machine and i see failures here as well
2016-06-16T23:32:24 <avtar> https://gist.github.com/avtar/f4eb8732878bb8f22a28835909cc4a31

2016-06-16T23:33:31 <gtirloni> same place where jenkins fails
2016-06-16T23:33:42 <avtar> https://gist.github.com/avtar/f4eb8732878bb8f22a28835909cc4a31#file-unit-tests-L964

2016-06-16T23:37:15 <jhernandez_> avtar: then ... what\'s going on with our vms where we saw them passing?
2016-06-16T23:38:03 <gloob> that is expected
2016-06-16T23:38:49 <gloob> gtirloni: in jenkins there\'s a ton of more errors
2016-06-16T23:38:59 <gloob> no
2016-06-16T23:39:06 <gloob> avtar output is the same as in our vms
2016-06-16T23:39:36 <gloob> first time, highcontrast failed
2016-06-16T23:39:51 <gloob> about the acceptance error I don\'t care currently
2016-06-16T23:40:58 <gloob> gtirloni: the point is that current jenkins windows unit tests output is not the same as https://gist.github.com/avtar/f4eb8732878bb8f22a28835909cc4a31
2016-06-16T23:41:18 <gloob> the errors avtar is experiencing are expected now
2016-06-16T23:41:53 <gloob> well, or maybe not, because they supposed to work in 32bits, but I think the contrast error in unit tests always fails for first time
2016-06-16T23:43:17 <avtar> gloob: i expected the gpii.tests.windows.killProcess test to pass in jenkins
2016-06-16T23:43:17 <gloob> oh wait
2016-06-16T23:43:33 <avtar> which it did https://ci.gpii.net/job/windows-unit-tests/9/console.html but only once so far
2016-06-16T23:43:34 <gloob> this is last? https://ci.gpii.net/job/windows-unit-tests/9/console.html
2016-06-16T23:43:41 <gloob> that\'s fine
2016-06-16T23:43:54 <gloob> EXCEPT the weird jqunit error
2016-06-16T23:43:58 <gloob> what get changed?
2016-06-16T23:44:27 <gtirloni> i think we\'re seeing multiple tests being flaky. killprocess fails, then it\'s that os_win7/flatmatchmaker test failing... but only sometimes. it\'s weird.
2016-06-16T23:44:38 <avtar> gloob: and then the behaviour went back to the original failure(s) https://ci.gpii.net/job/windows-unit-tests/10/console.html
2016-06-16T23:44:41 <gloob> gtirloni: sorry, you were right, I though we we were talking about previous jenkins job
2016-06-16T23:44:53 <gloob> gtirloni: no, that\'s under control
2016-06-16T23:45:01 <gloob> except the flatmatchmaker that is new for me
2016-06-16T23:45:05 <gloob> the other one is expected
2016-06-16T23:45:08 <gtirloni> ok cool
2016-06-16T23:45:10 <gloob> and fixed soon
2016-06-16T23:45:21 <gloob> I know what\'s happening
2016-06-16T23:45:40 <gloob> so, what get changed in jenkins?
2016-06-16T23:46:21 <avtar> gloob: i deleted the win10 box, added it back again, restarted the node, and then triggered the job
2016-06-16T23:46:33 <gloob> that\'s job 9?
2016-06-16T23:46:37 <avtar> yup
2016-06-16T23:46:46 <gloob> and the job 10 is showing the same weirds errors, right?
2016-06-16T23:46:54 <avtar> deleting/adding it probably wasn\'t necessary since it\'s the same box
2016-06-16T23:46:58 <gtirloni> and now it\'s unit tests first, then acceptance tests right? i don\'t know if that\'s different from the last time you guys talked about these errors
2016-06-16T23:46:59 <avtar> gloob: yeah
2016-06-16T23:47:44 <gloob> gtirloni: we are adding unit tests first because acceptance tests hides the ONLY ONE TIME SHOWING bug of highcontrast
2016-06-16T23:47:54 <gtirloni> ok
2016-06-16T23:47:59 <gloob> avtar: so we are having a cleaning problem in jenkins for whatever reason
2016-06-16T23:48:15 <gloob> that\'s freaking weird
2016-06-16T23:48:28 <avtar> yeah
2016-06-16T23:48:33 <gtirloni> other than that, i think the only changes are what has been committed to gpii/windows, gpii/universal, etc... the environment gets refreshed from these repos every time it runs
2016-06-16T23:48:39 <avtar> i saved a snapshot of my local vm to try this again
2016-06-16T23:48:43 <gloob> it\'s like it is reusing an old mount point?
2016-06-16T23:48:56 <gloob> or get dirty by re-provisioning
2016-06-16T23:48:57 <gloob> or what
2016-06-16T23:49:26 <avtar> gloob: the workspace gets wiped out at the beginning of every job
2016-06-16T23:49:34 <gloob> gtirloni: yes, but you see, if avtar destroy the box all goes fine in the first run
2016-06-16T23:49:45 <gtirloni> got it, that\'s weird. agreed
2016-06-16T23:50:01 <gloob> avtar: could you confirm that?
2016-06-16T23:50:07 <gloob> avtar: a lunch bet?
2016-06-16T23:50:13 <gloob> a flight plane to toronto ?
2016-06-16T23:50:14 <avtar> haha
2016-06-16T23:50:14 <avtar> sure
2016-06-16T23:50:19 <gloob> I miss the IPAs
2016-06-16T23:50:21 <gtirloni> oh the stakes are getting higher!
2016-06-16T23:50:26 <avtar> maybe not a plane ticket but a lunch bet
2016-06-16T23:50:43 <gloob> hehe
2016-06-16T23:50:59 <gloob> umhhhhhhhh
2016-06-16T23:51:02 <avtar> i\'ll destroy the box that\'s lingering right now, create a test file in the workspace, and then trigger a new job
2016-06-16T23:51:22 <gloob> what means create a test file?
2016-06-16T23:51:30 <gloob> in this context
2016-06-16T23:51:55 <avtar> gloob: just something like: touch workspace/test.lol
2016-06-16T23:52:10 <gloob> ah, for checking deleting, great
2016-06-16T23:52:20 <avtar> btw i was destroying the lingering VMs before triggering other test jobs
2016-06-16T23:52:24 <gtirloni> the workspace is the directory jenkins creates and then it runs git clones in there, etc.
2016-06-16T23:52:38 <gloob> yes, I sadly know
2016-06-16T23:52:54 <gtirloni> sadness and jenkins go hand in hand :)
2016-06-16T23:53:00 <gloob> jenkins is always a good idea
2016-06-16T23:53:06 <gloob> after implementing it
2016-06-16T23:53:12 <gloob> before* I mean
2016-06-16T23:53:47 <gloob> after is always tears and blood in the developers, devops, operations, managers, c*
2016-06-16T23:53:53 <gloob> areas
2016-06-16T23:54:09 <avtar> ok, lingering vm destroyed and test file created
2016-06-16T23:54:12 <avtar> about to trigger a job
2016-06-16T23:54:23 <gloob> GO JOB GO
2016-06-16T23:55:34 <gtirloni> at a previous job we used to keep the picture of a catholic saint in some servers\' cabinets to help with these things. if the weirdness continue with this jenkins job, that could be a next step maybe..
2016-06-16T23:55:45 <avtar> http://pastie.org/pastes/10880243/text
2016-06-16T23:55:54 <avtar> gotta admit, i was doubting myself as i triggered it
2016-06-16T23:56:00 <gloob> its there
2016-06-16T23:56:21 <gloob> and now it goes away
2016-06-16T23:56:32 <gloob> and the provisioning didnt run, right?
2016-06-16T23:56:51 <avtar> it\'s running right now
2016-06-16T23:56:55 <gloob> because node
2016-06-16T23:57:00 <gloob> node modules didnt exists
2016-06-16T23:57:21 <avtar> it hasn\'t gotten that far yet
2016-06-16T23:57:41 <avtar> takes a few mins to get to npm
2016-06-16T23:58:11 <gloob> gtirloni: are you in same timezone than the canadian folks?
2016-06-16T23:58:18 <gloob> in the*
2016-06-16T23:58:25 <gtirloni> i\'m in gmt-3, one hour in front of them right now
2016-06-16T23:58:39 <gloob> -5 for me
2016-06-16T23:58:47 <gloob> from me
2016-06-16T23:58:48 <avtar> shall we call it a night?
'

b'2016-06-16T18:47:08 <colinclark> for certain
2016-06-16T18:47:14 <gloob> worked for me, before
2016-06-16T18:47:23 <gloob> acceptance tests first and later unit tests
2016-06-16T18:47:32 <colinclark> interesting
2016-06-16T18:47:36 <gloob> I\'m recreating a new machine again
2016-06-16T18:47:43 <gloob> I\'m bitted
2016-06-16T18:47:45 <colinclark> it\'s fun, isn\'t it?
2016-06-16T18:48:12 <gloob> oh yes, but I have other things in the queue :((((((((
2016-06-16T18:51:10 <colinclark> yeah, I know
2016-06-16T18:51:11 <colinclark> me too
2016-06-16T18:53:44 <gloob> vagrant reload
2016-06-16T18:53:50 <gloob> curiosly it goes faster now
2016-06-16T18:54:45 * bens has quit
2016-06-16T18:55:08 <avtar> gloob: you could say that\'s quite... random
2016-06-16T18:55:33 <gloob> avtar: stochastic
2016-06-16T18:56:14 <gloob> colinclark: good news, it crashed for first time here too
2016-06-16T18:56:18 <colinclark> ok
2016-06-16T18:57:00 * wale joined the channel
2016-06-16T18:57:44 <gloob> a struct
2016-06-16T18:57:46 <gloob> uhummm
2016-06-16T18:58:50 <colinclark> still consistent for me too
2016-06-16T18:58:51 <colinclark> so
2016-06-16T18:59:09 <gloob> I\'ll check it
2016-06-16T18:59:11 <colinclark> avtar, imma merge your branch
2016-06-16T18:59:17 <colinclark> then go sailing
2016-06-16T18:59:30 <colinclark> gloob, your branch is officially wicked, too
2016-06-16T18:59:42 <colinclark> i just don\'t feel like I\'m a hot enough C programmer to safely review it
2016-06-16T18:59:57 <colinclark> hence putting it on Bosmon\'s queue
2016-06-16T19:00:25 <colinclark> gloob: I think it might be best to create a new PR against master with your two commits if you can
2016-06-16T19:00:41 <colinclark> since jhernandez_\'s original PR title and description is now totally out of sync
2016-06-16T19:00:57 <gloob> np
2016-06-16T19:01:09 <colinclark> plus that way you get more meritocratic attention
2016-06-16T19:01:17 <colinclark> jhernandez_ is always trying to steal your thunder
2016-06-16T19:01:18 <colinclark> :P
2016-06-16T19:01:28 <gloob> nah, it was force by me
2016-06-16T19:01:37 <gloob> I\'m a humble guy from the north of Africa
2016-06-16T19:01:41 <colinclark> hahaha
2016-06-16T19:02:54 <colinclark> avtar: What are the odds that the CI build will just magically trigger when I push this?
2016-06-16T19:02:58 <colinclark> pretty high, right?
2016-06-16T19:05:09 <avtar> colinclark: yes
2016-06-16T19:05:36 <avtar> are you merging it now?
2016-06-16T19:05:42 <colinclark> yeah, done
2016-06-16T19:05:54 <avtar> success!
2016-06-16T19:07:03 <colinclark> awesome
2016-06-16T19:07:11 <colinclark> see, trustworthy and reliable!
2016-06-16T19:07:22 <colinclark> ok, i\'m going to hit the road for the day now
2016-06-16T19:07:29 <colinclark> but you can always get me on hangouts or skype

2016-06-16T19:41:52 <avtar> i noticed that you and colin were chatting about the order in which the tests should be run https://botbot.me/freenode/fluid-work/2016-06-16/?msg=68049666&page=3
2016-06-16T19:42:40 <avtar> https://ci.gpii.net/job/windows-acceptance-tests/5/console.html

2016-06-16T19:43:02 <gloob> could we change the url into the emails?
2016-06-16T19:43:25 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2016-06-16T19:43:38 <avtar> if the order matters then we\'ll need to reorder things here https://github.com/GPII/ci-service/blob/master/jenkins_jobs/windows.yml#L72-L92
2016-06-16T19:46:26 <gloob> umhhh
2016-06-16T19:46:37 <gloob> yes, unit tests before acceptance tests would be good
2016-06-16T19:46:53 <avtar> :/
2016-06-16T19:46:54 <avtar> ok
2016-06-16T19:47:17 <gloob> but curiously in the jenkins there\'s more and new errors that in vagrant machine
2016-06-16T19:47:36 <gloob> avtar: should I provide PR or could you change it on the fly?
2016-06-16T19:48:02 <gloob> in jenkins the failing tests give error 5 in vagrant machines it gives error 0
2016-06-16T19:49:33 <gloob> it isn\'t the same process as in a developer box right?
2016-06-16T19:49:51 <gloob> ah no, it is mostly       - shell: DISPLAY=:0 BUILD_ID=vmShouldPersist vagrant up --provider virtualbox
2016-06-16T19:51:32 <gloob> it\'s a vagrant up plus the jenkins stuff
2016-06-16T19:54:03 <avtar> gloob: yeah, it\'s the same workflow except jenkins is launching vagrant and running the tests
2016-06-16T19:55:58 <gloob> adding weirdness =)
2016-06-16T19:56:11 <gloob> spinning another vm with the jenkins content
2016-06-16T19:57:30 <avtar> gloob: the one difference is that we don\'t restart the vm with jenkins
2016-06-16T19:58:30 <avtar> because using winrm it gets access to the updated path
2016-06-16T19:59:21 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2016-06-16T19:59:45 <gloob> uhum, that\'s a such big difference
2016-06-16T20:00:35 <gloob> we cannot see the output of the vagrant in the jenkins job console?

2016-06-16T20:03:31 <avtar> you\'re right though
2016-06-16T20:03:44 <avtar> the url issue is a pain
2016-06-16T20:04:52 <avtar> to add to the confusion i just created a new vm using gpii/windows master and ran the acceptance tests first followed by unit tests
2016-06-16T20:04:54 <avtar> https://gist.githubusercontent.com/anonymous/75eca90a0abbf8dfb9191cb24507b83b/raw/3bfa961237d7312f678d24c0381918b337abe64f/output.txt
2016-06-16T20:05:22 <avtar> no failures
2016-06-16T20:06:02 <gloob> yes, that is what we expected
2016-06-16T20:06:33 <gloob> 12:20:56.908:  FATAL ERROR: Uncaught exception: Cannot find module \'jqUnit\'
2016-06-16T20:06:37 <gloob> this is really weird
2016-06-16T20:08:07 <gloob> is it viable to do a vagrant reload?
2016-06-16T20:09:06 <avtar> you mean on the build node?
2016-06-16T20:09:22 <gloob> yes, in the jenkins job
2016-06-16T20:09:40 <gloob> I think it is worth to test at least
2016-06-16T20:10:06 <Justin_o> jhung: i\'ve been talking to gtirloni in the ops channel regarding the ownCloud issues i\'ve been having
2016-06-16T20:10:32 <avtar> gloob: yeah, the vm is still running so i can do that
2016-06-16T20:10:36 <jhung> Justin_o: ok
2016-06-16T20:10:56 <gloob> avtar: just curious to see if the same errors happens
2016-06-16T20:11:03 <Justin_o> jhung: it seems that the files i\'m having issues with were uploaded by you and it seems that the uploads didn\'t complete. Could you try to reupload them..
2016-06-16T20:11:15 <Justin_o> i can send you the files i\'m currently having trouble with
2016-06-16T20:11:38 <jhung> ok.
2016-06-16T20:11:43 <Justin_o> jhung: thanks
2016-06-16T20:12:00 <jhung> Odd that my client didn\'t figure that out and try to finish the upload Justin_o.
2016-06-16T20:12:10 <avtar> gloob: the issue will be getting access to the build node\'s display
2016-06-16T20:12:32 <gloob> you cannot rerun the unit tests jenkin job?
2016-06-16T20:13:09 <Justin_o> jhung: yah, not sure what happened
2016-06-16T20:13:21 <Justin_o> jhung: here is the current list, but there might be more afterwards
2016-06-16T20:13:25 <Justin_o> IDRC-Design/Projects/PhET/John-Travoltage/assets/John Travolta with mask.psd

2016-06-16T20:13:32 <avtar> only if i do this beforehand https://github.com/GPII/ci-service/blob/master/jenkins_jobs/windows.yml#L70
2016-06-16T20:13:42 <jhung> ok. I\'ll move that directory and move it back and see what happens.
2016-06-16T20:14:13 <Justin_o> jhung: good idea, thanks
2016-06-16T20:14:22 <avtar> since the tests require access to a windows\'s "console" session
2016-06-16T20:14:37 <gloob> avtar: meanwhile the system is rebooted would be fine
2016-06-16T20:14:48 <Justin_o> Bosmon, colinclark, michelled: i\'ve continued work on https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5832 by continuing on from the original pull request https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/662
2016-06-16T20:14:51 <jhung> ok it\'s syncing now Justin_o.
2016-06-16T20:15:01 <Justin_o> jhung: thanks
2016-06-16T20:15:35 <Justin_o> Bosmon, colinclark, michelled: my current branch is https://github.com/jobara/infusion/tree/FLUID-5832
2016-06-16T20:16:28 * anvk has quit
2016-06-16T20:16:49 <avtar> gloob: doing a vagrant reload on the build node now
2016-06-16T20:18:14 <Justin_o> Bosmon, colinclark, michelled: i\'m having some issues though. 1) source maps aren\'t supported by grunt-contib-stylus plugin (filed https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5918), 2) Uglify can\'t be used to create uncompressed files (source builds) https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2/issues/696 3) grunt-contrib-concat does support source maps, but they
2016-06-16T20:18:14 <Justin_o> aren\'t working. i get the "Failed to parse SourceMap" error in the chrome debugger, although the link it provides does download the map file. Interestingly, if i use the source map created by uglify it seems to work.
2016-06-16T20:20:44 <michelled> Justin_o: does it work FF?
2016-06-16T20:21:11 <Justin_o> michelled: same behaviour, but i don\'t think ff showed an error
2016-06-16T20:21:33 <avtar> gloob: ok, running the unit tests to confirm
2016-06-16T20:23:18 <Justin_o> michelled: double checked, i don\'t see an error in the console, but it doesn\'t work
2016-06-16T20:23:55 <Bosmon> Justin_o - that\'s great, thanks for looking into this!
2016-06-16T20:25:00 <Bosmon> I guess we can do without source maps for CSS now, since we had never had them before : P
2016-06-16T20:25:43 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yah, i think the CSS is probably less critical
2016-06-16T20:25:55 <Justin_o> but something that would be great to have later.. hopefully we can get it figured out eventually
2016-06-16T20:26:07 <Justin_o> Bosmon: what about the issue with source builds though?
2016-06-16T20:26:20 <Bosmon> I imagine when grunt-contrib-concat claims it supports source maps, it just means it can create them that refer to the concatting process that it operates itself
2016-06-16T20:26:43 <Bosmon> Not that it can combine source maps created by upstream processes into concatted source maps
2016-06-16T20:26:52 <michelled> Justin_o: why would we want source builds if we have source maps?
2016-06-16T20:27:02 <Bosmon> What is a "source build", inf act?
2016-06-16T20:27:30 <Justin_o> Bosmon: there do not seem to be any options to pass along source maps to it.. but i don\'t think we need to do that anyways
2016-06-16T20:28:03 <Justin_o> a source build is basically the same as regular build but without minifying the concatenated file.
2016-06-16T20:28:24 <Justin_o> in terms of tasks the source build uses concat instead of uglify
2016-06-16T20:29:04 <Justin_o> https://github.com/jobara/infusion/blob/FLUID-5832/Gruntfile.js#L231
2016-06-16T20:29:12 <Justin_o> https://github.com/jobara/infusion/blob/FLUID-5832/Gruntfile.js#L223
2016-06-16T20:32:19 <Justin_o> I have to run, but i\'ll try to check the logs when I\'m back on tomorrow if you have any thoughts.
2016-06-16T20:34:10 <alanharnum> Bosmon: I ran a quick spike of modifying floe.chartAuthoring.updateDataEntryPanelFromDataSet to work directly via the dataEntryPanel model, it works fine.
'

b'2016-06-16T17:39:00 <colinclark> killing works, the SPI tests fail the first time, and pass the second
2016-06-16T17:39:20 <gloob> I don\'t know, I didn\'t tested on it
2016-06-16T17:39:20 <colinclark> so now I"m going to try your branch in 64-bit to see if we still have the "fail first time" behaviour
2016-06-16T17:39:33 <colinclark> and THEN I\'ll see what happens in 32 bits
2016-06-16T17:39:43 <gloob> I\'m also spinning a new fresh 64bits machine
2016-06-16T17:39:47 <gloob> ok, perfect
2016-06-16T17:39:49 <Bosmon> 75 bits of a bus
2016-06-16T17:39:56 <colinclark> hahaha
2016-06-16T17:39:59 <gloob> I\'m more interested in the 32bits part
2016-06-16T17:40:16 <gloob> microbus
2016-06-16T17:40:28 <colinclark> one step at a time, this is becoming a bit clearer
2016-06-16T17:41:21 <colinclark> git remote add GLOOB
2016-06-16T17:41:24 <colinclark> GLOOOB
2016-06-16T17:41:35 <gloob> haha
2016-06-16T17:42:12 <gloob> pelaso    https://github.com/javihernandez/windows.git (fetch)
2016-06-16T17:42:22 <gloob> it\'s hard to explain the joke
2016-06-16T17:42:30 <gloob> what pelaso is xD
2016-06-16T17:43:27 <gloob> provisioning is slow
2016-06-16T17:43:50 <colinclark> yes, very
2016-06-16T17:43:56 <colinclark> it could be a drinking game!
2016-06-16T17:45:28 <gloob> it sounds like a good idea
2016-06-16T17:46:45 <jhernandez_> gloob: this is SEXY! --> https://github.com/javihernandez/windows/pull/3/files
2016-06-16T17:47:44 <gloob> that\'s
2016-06-16T17:49:03 <jhernandez_> what do I need to test and where?
2016-06-16T17:49:07 <jhernandez_> gloob: ?
2016-06-16T17:51:46 * bens joined the channel
2016-06-16T17:52:50 * clown joined the channel
2016-06-16T17:52:58 <gloob> jhernandez_: well, colinclark is testing in 64bits and I\'m spinning a new 64bits machine
2016-06-16T17:53:14 <gloob> 32bits and 64 with node32 would be great
2016-06-16T17:53:32 <colinclark> I\'m just testing gloob\'s branch straight up in vagrant
2016-06-16T17:53:43 <colinclark> so that should be 64-bit assuming avtar\'s patch hasn\'t been merged into it
2016-06-16T17:53:56 <gloob> no, it hasn\'t
2016-06-16T17:53:59 <colinclark> so jhernandez_ you could try combining gloob and avtar\'s branches
2016-06-16T17:54:03 <gloob> yes
2016-06-16T17:54:05 <jhernandez_> colinclark: "so now it passes the second time? but fails the first?" from my experience, it\'s still not clear to me, but it happens randomly :)
2016-06-16T17:54:06 <colinclark> and then you\'d have 32-bit
2016-06-16T17:54:14 <colinclark> jhernandez_: oooooh
2016-06-16T17:54:16 <colinclark> randomly!
2016-06-16T17:54:21 <gloob> RANDOM
2016-06-16T17:54:24 <colinclark> now that\'s interesting
2016-06-16T17:54:28 <gloob> random doesn\'t exists
2016-06-16T17:55:00 <jhernandez_> RANDOME
2016-06-16T17:55:54 * wannabeCitizen joined the channel
2016-06-16T17:56:05 <bens> hi colinclark, checking in here about something we were going to talk about about two weeks ago or so, but i forgot what it was about. Do you remember?
2016-06-16T17:56:13 <colinclark> bens: hey!
2016-06-16T17:56:26 <colinclark> we were going to talk about what\'d you be up to on the APCP :)
2016-06-16T17:57:06 <colinclark> but I never heard back from you
2016-06-16T17:57:06 <bens> colinclark, ah yes! I\'ve got some time now, today or tomorrow
2016-06-16T17:57:11 <colinclark> ok
2016-06-16T17:57:22 <colinclark> I\'m heading out shortly
2016-06-16T17:57:26 <colinclark> so let\'s look at the calendar for tomorrow
2016-06-16T17:57:30 <colinclark> when is good for you?
2016-06-16T17:57:45 <colinclark> I\'ve got 11-1 pm free
2016-06-16T17:57:47 <colinclark> or after 3 pm
2016-06-16T17:57:49 <colinclark> EDT
2016-06-16T17:58:20 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2016-06-16T17:58:20 <bens> Between 11-1 works for me,shall we say 11?
2016-06-16T17:58:51 <colinclark> sounds great, yes
2016-06-16T17:59:03 <colinclark> skype ok for you?
2016-06-16T17:59:04 <bens> colinclark, cool deal. skype?
2016-06-16T17:59:15 <colinclark> yup :)
2016-06-16T17:59:19 <bens> :)
2016-06-16T17:59:38 <colinclark> talk to you then
2016-06-16T17:59:54 <bens> colinclark, ok!
2016-06-16T18:01:26 <avtar> jhernandez_: i can send a pr again to your branch if that will make it easier for you to test with gloob\'s work
2016-06-16T18:02:13 <jhernandez_> avtar: thanks but don\'t worry, git and I are good friends ;)
2016-06-16T18:06:26 <colinclark> hahaha
2016-06-16T18:09:37 <colinclark> ok, so random or not, I\'ve seen the same behaviour in the two different branches
2016-06-16T18:10:41 <colinclark> In avtar\'s 32-bit node branch and in gloob\'s 64-bit fixes
2016-06-16T18:10:47 <colinclark> So we can kill stuff
2016-06-16T18:10:54 <colinclark> or rather, using better language
2016-06-16T18:10:59 <colinclark> we can stop processes
2016-06-16T18:11:01 <colinclark> successfully
2016-06-16T18:11:28 <colinclark> but the first time through I see the "testHighContrast" fail
2016-06-16T18:11:33 <gloob> we need to add to the tests a test for killing 32bits app in 64bits envoronment
2016-06-16T18:11:40 <gloob> umhh
2016-06-16T18:11:45 <gloob> registry values maybe?
2016-06-16T18:12:29 <gloob> ah, no, 64 bits apps in 64 bits environment, putty is 32bits
2016-06-16T18:12:40 * jhung joined the channel
2016-06-16T18:13:22 <jhernandez_> win64 with node32: tests passing
2016-06-16T18:16:04 <colinclark> jhernandez_: The first time? :)
2016-06-16T18:16:18 <jhernandez_> gloob: we can use the magnifier, and when in a 32bit OS, skip the test
2016-06-16T18:18:09 <jhernandez_> colinclark: well, let me re-provision it from the beginning, but yeah, just merged gloob\'s in, and they ran the first time
2016-06-16T18:18:12 <gloob> jhernandez_: yes, something like that
2016-06-16T18:18:23 <colinclark> jhernandez_: I\'m going to do the same
2016-06-16T18:18:47 <gloob> I\'m finishing it provisioning, but it get hung in universal.bat, is it known?
2016-06-16T18:19:41 <gloob> s/hung/paused
2016-06-16T18:20:27 <colinclark> I haven\'t ever noticed it, gloob
2016-06-16T18:21:04 <colinclark> jhernandez_: I\'ve been runing the tests a couple dozen times in my current VM
2016-06-16T18:21:07 <gloob> neither to me, but it\'s taking a long time
2016-06-16T18:21:16 <colinclark> and they pass consistently after the first time
2016-06-16T18:21:29 <colinclark> I did get stuck installing Chrome once
2016-06-16T18:21:34 <gloob> ==> default: c:\

2016-06-16T18:21:42 <jhernandez_> colinclark: weird
2016-06-16T18:22:15 <jhernandez_> colinclark: maybe a stupid question but, is your box up to date?
2016-06-16T18:22:22 <colinclark> jhernandez_: So next step is to provision the box a couple more times and verify that it always fails the first time
2016-06-16T18:22:28 <colinclark> well, I dunno
2016-06-16T18:22:37 <colinclark> I just type "vagrant destroy -f"
2016-06-16T18:22:43 <colinclark> for good luck, I delete node_modules
2016-06-16T18:22:47 <colinclark> and then I run "vagrant up"
2016-06-16T18:22:53 <jhernandez_> exactly
2016-06-16T18:23:05 <jhernandez_> and after is up, "vagrant reload"
2016-06-16T18:23:06 <colinclark> followed by "vagrant reload" after the box is first provisioned
2016-06-16T18:23:07 <colinclark> yup
2016-06-16T18:23:26 <jhernandez_> Progress: 20%
2016-06-16T18:23:37 <jhernandez_> heading the kitchen to cook some food
2016-06-16T18:23:41 <jhernandez_> tty later
2016-06-16T18:24:28 <colinclark> yup
2016-06-16T18:24:44 <gloob> the reload step should be documented in the readme meanwhile avtar or alfredo fix it
2016-06-16T18:25:56 <gloob> ok, new machine
2016-06-16T18:26:01 <gloob> acceptanceTests all green
2016-06-16T18:26:06 <gloob> unit tests all green
2016-06-16T18:26:19 <gloob> sadly I launched the acceptance first
2016-06-16T18:26:21 <gloob> :(
2016-06-16T18:26:53 * alanharnum joined the channel
2016-06-16T18:27:46 <gloob> so I didn\'t see any first problem with magnifier
2016-06-16T18:27:55 <gloob> with highcontrast, I mean
2016-06-16T18:32:31 <colinclark> gloob: the reload step is documented
2016-06-16T18:32:44 <colinclark> though perhaps not ideally
2016-06-16T18:33:01 <gloob> ah, didn\'t noticed, in this case GREAT
2016-06-16T18:33:14 <colinclark> https://github.com/gpii/windows#test-vm
2016-06-16T18:33:21 <colinclark> I didn\'t notice either, to be honest
2016-06-16T18:33:30 <colinclark> avtar is a wonderful prose writer
2016-06-16T18:33:34 <colinclark> the narrative just flows
2016-06-16T18:33:48 <colinclark> but we might want to break the commands out into a set of setps
2016-06-16T18:33:49 <colinclark> steps
2016-06-16T18:36:43 <gloob> yes
2016-06-16T18:40:46 <colinclark> ok, so if it really is random, I still don\'t have enough samples to be sure
2016-06-16T18:40:57 <colinclark> but I\'d be betting money that this isn\'t random at all
2016-06-16T18:41:33 <colinclark> and that the testHighContrast tests fail the first time
2016-06-16T18:41:45 <colinclark> i think i have time to provision the box one more time before I leave
2016-06-16T18:41:50 <colinclark> and that\'ll be four times
2016-06-16T18:42:01 <colinclark> so gloob, you rock
2016-06-16T18:42:09 <colinclark> here\'s my proposal for next steps:
2016-06-16T18:42:18 <colinclark> 1. We merge avtar\'s 32-bit switch
2016-06-16T18:42:37 <colinclark> 2. You and jhernandez_ can take some time to get your new PR all set to go
2016-06-16T18:42:45 <colinclark> 3. Bosmon will review it
2016-06-16T18:42:54 <colinclark> then we switch back to 64-bit
2016-06-16T18:43:06 <colinclark> in the meantime, we will need to figure out why the test fails the first time
2016-06-16T18:43:15 <colinclark> and if we suffered from this back in Windows 7 or if it is a new issue
2016-06-16T18:43:29 <colinclark> Does this seem reasonable?
2016-06-16T18:44:06 <gloob> sure, good for me
2016-06-16T18:44:28 <gloob> sounds like a plan
2016-06-16T18:45:10 <gloob> colinclark: you just run unit tests to trigger the problem with testHighContrast, right?
2016-06-16T18:45:33 <gloob> I mean, without calling acceptance tests first
2016-06-16T18:46:33 <colinclark> yup
2016-06-16T18:46:34 <colinclark> exactly
2016-06-16T18:46:50 <colinclark> if I had to guess, the acceptance tests will fail the first time
2016-06-16T18:46:55 <colinclark> if you didn\'t run the unit tests first
2016-06-16T18:46:59 <colinclark> but I also don\'t know that :)

2016-06-16T13:36:09 <colinclark> jhernandez_: thanks for the clarification
2016-06-16T13:36:46 <gloob> 16pm
2016-06-16T13:37:42 <gloob> I\'m currently working in fixing spi problems
2016-06-16T13:37:43 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2016-06-16T13:37:45 <gloob> BUT
2016-06-16T13:37:46 <Justin_o> Apple\'s new tool for teaching swift programming. It was announced at WWDC on Monday. http://www.apple.com/swift/playgrounds/
2016-06-16T13:38:06 <gloob> It\'ll get a while, I need to do other boring stuff
2016-06-16T13:38:19 <gloob> although I have isolated the spi problem so far
2016-06-16T13:38:48 <gloob> so, current merge from avtar execture by jhernandez_ is temporary
2016-06-16T13:39:06 * wale has quit
2016-06-16T13:41:15 <Justin_o> Here\'s another interesting link http://www.apple.com/education/everyone-can-code/
2016-06-16T13:41:20 <gloob> probably makes sense to extend the unit tests with one killing 64 bits application
2016-06-16T13:42:04 <gloob> what apple needs to do is release the new macbook pros NOW and stop doing emojis related development, thanks.
2016-06-16T13:42:16 <Justin_o> doesn\'t seem to be quite the "User Creativity" we\'ve been talking about in the community meetings though
2016-06-16T13:42:29 <Justin_o> gloob: lol
2016-06-16T13:43:39 <Justin_o> gloob: i agree, i don\'t see being able to change text into an emoji a very useful feature.. brings new meaning to the "telephone game"
2016-06-16T13:44:14 <gtirloni> alanharnum amatas: sending 301\'s on incorrect domains should help demoting these utoronto.ca URLs from google results and stop the confusion (https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/INFRA-83) -- like we do for ocad.ca vs. ocadu.ca, but instead of only serving the correct domain, we\'ll have to everything that\'s not the correct and ends up hitting our servers
2016-06-16T13:44:36 <gtirloni> *we\'ll have to serve
2016-06-16T13:45:39 * wale joined the channel

2016-06-16T13:46:34 <gloob> Justin_o: I don\'t use ios in my phone, so I don\'t bother so much but, yes, their innovation is pretty weak these days, I hope the hardware keeps being just good
2016-06-16T13:46:56 <gloob> besides now I need to search and replace any reference for Mac OS X by macOS
2016-06-16T13:48:00 <Justin_o> gloob: at least you\'ll save some characters
2016-06-16T13:48:32 <colinclark> Justin_o: There\'s something about the latter page that makes me shudder a bit
2016-06-16T13:48:38 <colinclark> it\'s just all too convenient
2016-06-16T13:49:45 <colinclark> to conflate generalized human values--"solve problems," "work together"--with "building apps"
2016-06-16T13:50:22 <colinclark> "a coding language for everyone"
2016-06-16T13:50:35 <colinclark> It\'s very very interesting to read
2016-06-16T13:55:20 <Justin_o> colinclark: I think the phrase "Everyone Can Code" sort of puts this all into context. That is, it\'s still all about coding. Where as, what we\'ve been talking about seems to be beyond code...
2016-06-16T13:55:25 <Justin_o> sorry that was pretty abstract

2016-06-16T14:00:23 <colinclark> that\'s exactly it
2016-06-16T14:00:53 <amatas> jhernandez_, my vidyo room can be a good place
2016-06-16T14:00:59 <simonjb> Justin_o: thanks for the Everyone Can Code link -- very interesting
2016-06-16T14:01:06 <simonjb> I just watched the movie
2016-06-16T14:01:07 <jhernandez_> amatas: is it tidy? :P
2016-06-16T14:01:11 <colinclark> Justin_o: To be fair, I think that playground probably has lots of interesting liveness
2016-06-16T14:02:03 <colinclark> be there in a sec, amatas
2016-06-16T14:02:43 * gtirloni joined the channel
2016-06-16T14:03:00 <simonjb> pretty interesting
2016-06-16T14:03:03 <Justin_o> colinclark: yes, i think that playgrounds could be quite beneficial. Although I\'m not sure it\'s as revolutionary as they make it sound
2016-06-16T14:03:35 <Justin_o> it is quite pretty though, which may help with adoption and encouraging engagement
2016-06-16T14:04:02 <amatas> avtar, gtirloni we are in my vidyo room

2016-06-16T17:10:50 <colinclark> I\'m sure I remember you mentioning this at some point
2016-06-16T17:11:01 <colinclark> but I guess it still implies that the system isn\'t working properly

2016-06-16T17:25:54 * jhung joined the channel
2016-06-16T17:26:16 <gloob> colinclark: probably my change also fix strange behaviours in 32bits
2016-06-16T17:26:36 <gloob> for me, it\'s a surprise that it could be working
2016-06-16T17:26:55 <gloob> probably because the equality of a pointer of 32bits and a pointer to an array of chars
2016-06-16T17:27:42 <gloob> I\'m commiting it through jhernandez repository to let him to add it in the current pull request and not create a new one
2016-06-16T17:27:55 <gloob> anyhow, windows port needs some love, I added some TODOs
2016-06-16T17:29:50 <colinclark> fascinating
2016-06-16T17:29:53 <colinclark> I was just having a look
2016-06-16T17:31:42 <colinclark> gloob: Can you explain what the new pull does?
2016-06-16T17:31:48 <colinclark> What issue does it fix?
2016-06-16T17:31:49 <gloob> jhernandez_: please linting the commits, I didn-t
2016-06-16T17:33:13 <gloob> colinclark: the breakage of some tests on testSpiSettingsHandler.js
2016-06-16T17:33:21 <colinclark> ok
2016-06-16T17:33:23 <colinclark> cool
2016-06-16T17:33:26 <colinclark> some but not all?
2016-06-16T17:33:30 <gloob> ALL
2016-06-16T17:33:34 <colinclark> oooh
2016-06-16T17:33:37 <gloob> no it\'s all green
2016-06-16T17:33:41 <colinclark> wowza
2016-06-16T17:33:42 <colinclark> hot stuff
2016-06-16T17:34:01 <gloob> windows is sane, again
2016-06-16T17:34:03 <gloob> "sane"
2016-06-16T17:34:07 <colinclark> and they pass the first time?
2016-06-16T17:34:11 <gloob> you know, as far as windows could be
2016-06-16T17:34:12 <gloob> no
2016-06-16T17:34:14 <colinclark> ah
2016-06-16T17:34:17 <colinclark> that is interesting
2016-06-16T17:34:18 <gloob> spi was failing ever
2016-06-16T17:34:21 <gloob> in 64bits
2016-06-16T17:34:34 <colinclark> yes
2016-06-16T17:34:38 <colinclark> so now it passes the second time?
2016-06-16T17:34:40 <colinclark> but fails the first?
2016-06-16T17:34:51 <gloob> with the testNonClientMetrics payloads
2016-06-16T17:34:54 <colinclark> right
2016-06-16T17:35:01 <gloob> with the ones that define a struct to be precise
2016-06-16T17:35:05 <colinclark> ok
2016-06-16T17:35:15 <gloob> now its works ever as far as I tested
2016-06-16T17:35:22 <gloob> what its that?
2016-06-16T17:35:31 <gloob> there\'s some tests failing the first time only?
2016-06-16T17:36:00 <gloob> let me recreate the machine
2016-06-16T17:36:02 <gloob> to be sure
2016-06-16T17:36:36 <colinclark> Yeah, it seems that, with 32-bit node, the SPI tests do pass
2016-06-16T17:36:37 <gloob> vagrant destroy, instead of machines I imagine I\'m destroying planets
2016-06-16T17:36:40 <colinclark> but not the first time they are run
2016-06-16T17:36:41 <colinclark> hahaha
2016-06-16T17:36:46 <gloob> umhhh
2016-06-16T17:36:53 <colinclark> yes, it\'s all very interesting
2016-06-16T17:37:00 <gloob> could be, for me is astonishing it works in 32bits also
2016-06-16T17:37:22 <colinclark> I just tested jhernandez_\'s GPII-1826 branch, which has the first half of your fix in it
2016-06-16T17:37:23 <colinclark> i.e. the one for killing
2016-06-16T17:37:25 <gloob> maybe could work because alignment
2016-06-16T17:37:28 <colinclark> and I do see that the SPI tests fail
2016-06-16T17:37:33 <gloob> exactly
2016-06-16T17:37:45 <colinclark> interestingly, I saw that 34/38 passed the first time
2016-06-16T17:37:48 <colinclark> and 35/38 the second
2016-06-16T17:37:50 <gloob> that is what this new pull (into jhernandez repo) fixs
2016-06-16T17:37:54 <colinclark> so now i\'ll try your new pull
2016-06-16T17:37:55 <colinclark> yes
2016-06-16T17:38:17 <gloob> you are checking in 32bits?
2016-06-16T17:38:25 <colinclark> I\'m checking in 64
2016-06-16T17:38:28 <gloob> ok
2016-06-16T17:38:35 <colinclark> i will eventually try all the variations
2016-06-16T17:38:43 <colinclark> so, to be clear
2016-06-16T17:38:47 <colinclark> with Avtar\'s pull request
2016-06-16T17:38:50 <colinclark> i.e. in 32 bits

2016-06-16T01:32:09 <jhernandez_> Bosmon: haha
2016-06-16T01:32:27 <Bosmon> jhernandez_ - use fluid.log!
2016-06-16T01:32:55 <jhernandez_> not that hard, had a few things to do that I couldn\'t do today as I was OUT trying to pay my TAXES!!!

2016-06-16T01:43:14 <jhernandez_> xDD
2016-06-16T01:46:13 <Bosmon> jhernandez_ - I don\'t know, perhaps you don\'t push the updates to github? : P
2016-06-16T01:48:38 <Bosmon> Ah, I see
2016-06-16T01:48:43 <Bosmon> I followed the link in the email thread

2016-06-16T01:49:06 <Bosmon> And once you follow a link like this, it doesn\'t matter how many times you refresh the view, it stays stuck at the old revision
2016-06-16T01:49:13 <jhernandez_> mistery solved!

2016-06-16T01:50:00 <Bosmon> No worries - thanks for your work on this important component!
2016-06-16T01:50:40 <jhernandez_> well, I\'m learning a lot about infusion
2016-06-16T01:51:11 <jhernandez_> but I\'ll keep being a ver bad programmer
2016-06-16T01:51:39 <jhernandez_> even worst than our beloved BELORUSSIAN
2016-06-16T01:51:44 <jhernandez_> xD
2016-06-16T01:52:19 <Bosmon> You will never be like that :)
2016-06-16T01:52:29 <Bosmon> I\'m sure you would never write a set of tests that pass whenever they fail :)
2016-06-16T02:02:30 <Bosmon> jhernandez_ - several of the comments on the outdated code are still relevant, even though they\'ve been displaced by the diff
2016-06-16T02:02:30 <jhernandez_> Bosmon: yup
2016-06-16T02:02:42 <jhernandez_> will take care of them too
2016-06-16T02:02:50 <jhernandez_> thanks again!
2016-06-16T02:03:11 <jhernandez_> now it\'s time to HIT THE HAY!

2016-06-16T13:07:55 <Dinuka> Bosmon: I have a small doubt about maintaining arrays in the model
2016-06-16T13:08:09 <Dinuka> will you be able to help me
2016-06-16T13:09:09 <Dinuka> actually what I want to know is whether there is any specific way to add model listeners for arrays.
2016-06-16T13:09:24 <Dinuka> or is it not allowed in infusion
2016-06-16T13:09:38 <jhernandez_> avtar: morning
2016-06-16T13:09:58 <jhernandez_> from my point of view, https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/73 is ready to go
2016-06-16T13:13:05 * wale joined the channel
2016-06-16T13:13:13 <jhernandez_> colinclark, Bosmon, gtirloni, gloob: wrt https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/73 - if there aren\'t any objections ... I\'ll  SHIP IT!
2016-06-16T13:15:45 <gtirloni> hi javi, no objection here. thanks!
2016-06-16T13:16:36 <avtar> jhernandez_: <ship emoji>
2016-06-16T13:17:02 <colinclark> jhernandez_: It looks good to me, save for one comment
2016-06-16T13:17:11 <colinclark> which I made on the pull request
2016-06-16T13:17:36 <colinclark> You can make the change when you push it, I think, without any trouble
2016-06-16T13:19:00 <gloob> and the next?
2016-06-16T13:19:11 <gloob> it was the last line, isn\'t it?
2016-06-16T13:19:14 <gloob> haha
2016-06-16T13:19:17 <jhernandez_> colinclark: oh, that\'s true, nice catch!
2016-06-16T13:19:24 <colinclark> no, there\'s one below it
2016-06-16T13:19:29 <gloob> ah
2016-06-16T13:19:36 <gloob> sad emoji
2016-06-16T13:19:39 <colinclark> haha
2016-06-16T13:19:46 <Bosmon> Dinuka - you can listen to changes in arrays, yes
2016-06-16T13:19:57 <gloob> ah the actual call
2016-06-16T13:19:59 <Bosmon> Although we don\'t yet have special "array-type" change events such as INSERT and DELETE
2016-06-16T13:20:19 <gloob> jhernandez_: go, I need it for test some crazy stuff
2016-06-16T13:20:37 <gloob> and I\'m lazy enough for not retrieving the PR by myself
2016-06-16T13:20:44 <jhernandez_> CRAZY  STUFFF
2016-06-16T13:20:53 <jhernandez_> COSAS LOCAS
2016-06-16T13:20:53 <Dinuka> Hi all, here is the blog and the wiki page of my GSOC project............ https://medium.com/@dinukadesilva    https://github.com/dinukadesilva/music-ctrls/wiki
2016-06-16T13:20:54 <gloob> CRASSSSSYY
2016-06-16T13:21:09 <colinclark> Dinuka: Looks awesome!
2016-06-16T13:21:20 <colinclark> I left you some code review feedback as issues on your Github repo yesterday
2016-06-16T13:21:24 <colinclark> I hope they make sense
2016-06-16T13:21:32 <colinclark> and are helpful, Dinuka :)
2016-06-16T13:22:02 <Dinuka> yeas....... they are really helpful
2016-06-16T13:22:38 <Dinuka> going forward, I\'l add pull requests for the changes I\'m working on
2016-06-16T13:22:48 <colinclark> oh great!
2016-06-16T13:22:49 <colinclark> good idea
2016-06-16T13:22:56 <Dinuka> so, I can get them reviewed
2016-06-16T13:23:14 <Dinuka> thanks colinclark
2016-06-16T13:23:23 <Bosmon> so to recap, jhernandez_ - in switching to 32 bit node, you didn\'t discover any problems in killing 64-bit processes as sgithens found?
2016-06-16T13:23:36 <Bosmon> Or do we just not use any in our acceptance tests?
2016-06-16T13:23:47 <Bosmon> Do you remember what process he had a problem killing?
2016-06-16T13:23:58 <colinclark> The one that failed was putty
2016-06-16T13:24:02 <jhernandez_> Bosmon: nope, acceptance tests make use of the magnifier, which it\'s a 64-bit process
2016-06-16T13:24:16 <colinclark> didn\'t putty get stuck, jhernandez_?
2016-06-16T13:24:22 <jhernandez_> colinclark: yup
2016-06-16T13:24:34 <Bosmon> But putty is 32-bit
2016-06-16T13:24:47 <jhernandez_> yes
2016-06-16T13:24:59 <jhernandez_> it wasn\'t even killed
2016-06-16T13:25:03 <colinclark> but we can also kill the magnifier, which is 64-bit?
2016-06-16T13:25:07 <jhernandez_> yes
2016-06-16T13:25:34 <Bosmon> [14:25] <jhernandez_> it wasn\'t even killed <-- so how do our tests pass?
2016-06-16T13:26:04 <jhernandez_> Bosmon: they weren\'t
2016-06-16T13:26:36 <jhernandez_> on windows 10 64bit + node 64bit we couldn\'t kill ANYTHING
2016-06-16T13:27:32 <jhernandez_> well, in fact gloob already fixed that, see https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/72/files
2016-06-16T13:27:33 <amatas> jhernandez_, colinclark, avtar are all of you ok if we start the linux package meeting in some minutes?
2016-06-16T13:27:51 * Yan_Hu joined the channel
2016-06-16T13:28:02 <colinclark> Bosmon: They didn\'t pass :)
2016-06-16T13:28:15 <colinclark> they would time out after 25 minutes
2016-06-16T13:28:38 <jhernandez_> amatas: 16pm CEST, isn\'t it?
2016-06-16T13:28:53 <jhernandez_> 4pm I mean
2016-06-16T13:29:34 <amatas> yes, but we can start half an hour earlier if everybody is ok
2016-06-16T13:29:51 <colinclark> so, in short, switching to 32-bit node mitigates the failure to kill things and the spi test failures
2016-06-16T13:30:09 <colinclark> gloob\'s #72 addresses the former in the 64-bit environment
2016-06-16T13:30:12 <colinclark> is that right, jhernandez_?
2016-06-16T13:31:24 * anvk joined the channel
2016-06-16T13:31:38 <gtirloni> amatas, i\'d like to participate in the linux pkg meeting if that\'s okay. sorry for not saying this yesterday in the arch mtg
2016-06-16T13:31:44 <Bosmon> I really wish we could get the utoronto folks to get rid of their faulty DNS record : P
2016-06-16T13:31:58 <Bosmon> https://project.courses.utoronto.ca/browse/GPII-1826
2016-06-16T13:32:05 <amatas> gtirloni, sure, please join us
2016-06-16T13:32:54 <amatas> project.courses.utoronto.ca?
2016-06-16T13:33:13 <colinclark> incredible
2016-06-16T13:33:23 <colinclark> michelled, alanharnum: Do you remember that? ^^
2016-06-16T13:33:50 <alanharnum> good lord
2016-06-16T13:33:54 <jhernandez_> colinclark: yes - switching to 32bit node solves the killing processes and spi fails. gloob\'s #72 solves the problem with killing processes in both archs
2016-06-16T13:34:07 <amatas> well the ssl certificate makes a dramatic warning of unsecured connection
2016-06-16T13:34:18 <alanharnum> was that the URL of the old CourseView bugzilla tracker?
2016-06-16T13:34:20 <colinclark> alanharnum: COURSIE IS ALIVE!
2016-06-16T13:34:40 <colinclark> After all these years, COURSIE IS ALIVE!
2016-06-16T13:34:47 <michelled> !!!!
2016-06-16T13:35:10 <colinclark> Apparently, it is now a WEBPAGE FOR EVERY GPII BUG
