b'2016-01-04T18:38:23 <jhung> ok
2016-01-04T18:38:37 <danayo> also zamcnema, putting it between back and next might also be confusing as it would seem to relate to these functions
2016-01-04T18:38:51 <danayo> would be better if it could be grouped with the adjuster itself
2016-01-04T18:39:43 <Justin_o> jhung, clown: on VoiceOver it announces it as an indeterminate progress indicator
2016-01-04T18:40:42 <clown> Justin_o, jhung, here are the AAPI mappings for <meter>:  http://rawgit.com/w3c/aria/master/html-aam/html-aam.html#el-meter
2016-01-04T18:41:04 <clown> Most of the mapping are to "progress bar".
2016-01-04T18:41:05 <clown> :-)
2016-01-04T18:41:40 <clown> which explains the VO result that Justin_o just reported.
2016-01-04T18:43:13 <Justin_o> clown: cool, so just using an aria progress role should work for us i think
2016-01-04T18:43:44 <clown> it\'s probably the only thing you can do for now.  I am looking to see what AT-SPI has to offer.

2016-01-04T18:46:50 <clown> Justin_o, jhung, I found a ROLE_DIAL, which is documented as "An object that allows a value to be changed via rotating a visual element, or which displays a value via such a rotating element."

2016-01-04T19:04:45 <clown> Justin_o, jhung, I\'m now asking joanie about <meter> and ROLE_DIAL, but I suspect it is early days in terms of developing that solution.
2016-01-04T19:05:38 <jhung> thanks clown.
2016-01-04T19:06:32 <clown> she says that using a progress bar is not ideal.  ATK has a ROLE_RATING as well, but it\'s not quite right either.
2016-01-04T19:07:50 * kasparnet has quit
2016-01-04T19:08:26 <clown> Justin_o, jhung, she found ROLE_LEVEL_BAR, defined as, "A bar that serves as a level indicator to, for instance, show the strength of a password or the state of a battery."
2016-01-04T19:08:42 <clown> but, it will take time to get the browsers to map to that role.
2016-01-04T19:09:15 <clown> And that\'s an ATK/AT-SPI role.  I\'ll check IA2; it may be there.  It\'s unlikely that it will be in AXAPI nor UIA.

2016-01-04T19:19:12 * clown checking MSAA
2016-01-04T19:19:15 <Justin_o> clown: okay, should we just use progress bar for now then?
2016-01-04T19:19:38 * alanharnum joined the channel
2016-01-04T19:19:53 <clown> yes, since even if there is a ROLE_LEVEL_BAR in one of the AAPIs, it\'s not being exposed by any browser.
2016-01-04T19:20:30 <clown> Justin_o: where is the page where you got VO to say "indeterminate progress"?  Is that the one I was looking at?
2016-01-04T19:20:40 * michelled has quit
2016-01-04T19:21:15 <Justin_o> no i just threw on a meter and tried it.. i\'ll give you a jsfiddle with a meter element... one second
2016-01-04T19:21:36 <clown> also, the mac keychain has a gizmo that shows the strength of various passwords.  I wonder what it comes out as?
2016-01-04T19:21:57 <Justin_o> clown: https://jsfiddle.net/2319uvva/
2016-01-04T19:24:08 <Justin_o> clown i checked something else like that in another app i have, it came out as AXLevelIndicator
2016-01-04T19:24:26 * jhernandez has quit
2016-01-04T19:24:26 <clown> So:  AXAPI does have something.
2016-01-04T19:24:45 <clown> but, safari is exposing it as a progress bar.
2016-01-04T19:25:12 <Justin_o> clown: yes, AXProgressIndicator
2016-01-04T19:25:20 * jhernandez joined the channel
2016-01-04T19:26:59 <Justin_o> clown, jhung: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTML/Element/progress
2016-01-04T19:27:21 <Justin_o> so there is a separate progress element as well, which makes it strange that meter is mapped to progressbar
2016-01-04T19:27:54 <clown> well, it is an editors\' draft.  And trying to find the correct role in the AAPIs is not always obvious.
2016-01-04T19:29:04 <Justin_o> clown: okay
2016-01-04T19:31:26 <Justin_o> clown, jhung: i\'m thinking for now to just use a progress element and set the aria-valuetext as needed.
2016-01-04T19:32:24 <clown> yeah,  you might also set the role thus:  role="levelindicator progress", but that\'s only a stopgap.
2016-01-04T19:32:53 <Justin_o> clown: is "level indicator" an actual role now?
2016-01-04T19:33:32 <clown> no, but the role attribute does take multiple values where the order given is "what I really want" followed by "fallback roles".
2016-01-04T19:33:45 <Justin_o> clown: okay
2016-01-04T19:34:48 <clown> and, the role string is copied verbatim to some property of the accessible object where an AT can look at that and use it over the actual ROLE property.  But, they have to parse the string, and decide if it\'s useful.
2016-01-04T19:35:07 <Justin_o> ah intersting, didn\'t know that it did that
2016-01-04T19:35:30 <clown> note that the value is a space separated list.  each whole "word" is another role.
2016-01-04T19:35:52 <clown> so, not "level indicator", but "levelindicator".
2016-01-04T19:36:21 <Justin_o> clown: thanks, that\'s good to know too
2016-01-04T19:36:52 <clown> Justin_o:  see the fifth item here:  http://www.w3.org/TR/core-aam-1.1/#roleMappingGeneralRules
2016-01-04T19:37:03 <clown> note that this does not work for MSAA nor AXAPI.
2016-01-04T19:38:21 <clown> Justin_o: also check out the first item in that list.
2016-01-04T19:39:01 <clown> just the first sentence in that item.

2016-01-04T20:08:10 <clown> Justin_o, I looked at the a11y tree for you <meter> test, and it doesn\'t expose anything other than a rather neutral "section".
2016-01-04T20:08:13 <clown> FF, that is.
2016-01-04T20:09:19 <Justin_o> that\'s unfortunate
2016-01-04T20:09:27 <Justin_o> i guess i\'ll stick with progress for now
2016-01-04T20:09:40 <Justin_o> hopefully meter will get better support in the future
2016-01-04T20:18:16 <Justin_o> jhung, clown: here\'s the example using a progress element http://jobara.github.io/john-travoltage-html/
2016-01-04T20:20:30 <clown> Justin_o, okay.  I find it a bit surprsing how fast the discharge occurs.
2016-01-04T20:20:43 <clown> but, I guess that\'s how static behaves.
2016-01-04T20:21:05 <Justin_o> clown: in the real sim it won\'t all discharge at once
2016-01-04T20:21:36 <clown> ah, I see.  no time to implement an animation yet?

2016-01-04T20:25:06 <colinclark> It looks like it\'s hidden behind a flag, as is the modern way
2016-01-04T20:25:14 <colinclark> but that\'s progress, anyway :)
2016-01-04T20:25:24 <Justin_o> clown: currently i\'m mocking up all the interactions though, so that it can be used for testing
2016-01-04T20:25:35 <clown> Justin_o:  understood
2016-01-04T20:25:52 <Justin_o> colinclark: cool, getting close then
2016-01-04T20:25:56 <colinclark> yup
2016-01-04T20:26:03 <Justin_o> maybe in a version or two it\'ll be fully supported
2016-01-04T20:26:08 <Justin_o> without the flag
2016-01-04T20:26:21 <colinclark> I hope so
2016-01-04T20:26:30 <colinclark> I don\'t know how these things work...
2016-01-04T20:26:35 * jhernandez has quit
2016-01-04T20:26:41 <colinclark> I guess either a vendor decides that their implementation is stable enough
2016-01-04T20:26:49 <colinclark> or they decide that the specification is stable enough
2016-01-04T20:27:19 <colinclark> one would imagine that it should be the latter, but it must be quite political
2016-01-04T20:27:26 <colinclark> almost makes you miss vendor prefixes :P

2016-01-04T14:59:49 <jhung> np
2016-01-04T15:00:26 <Justin_o> i was playing with the mock up of the sim with VoiceOver on Safari. The value text was working well and the alert was announced, although it kind of messed up the screen reader. as i was still able to use the keyboard to interact with the slider but it was no longer communicated by VoiceOver. Once i left the slider and came back, it was okay though.
2016-01-04T15:00:32 <Justin_o> jhung: ^
2016-01-04T15:01:29 <jhung> odd. You think the alert caused that in some way Justin_o?
2016-01-04T15:02:19 <Justin_o> It seemed to have, but i\'m not sure why, could have been a combination of the DOM injection and the alert, but i\'m not sure
2016-01-04T15:02:31 <simonjb> Justin_o: are we having floe planing now? do you know?

2016-01-04T15:03:42 <simonjb> jhung, Justin_o: ok, the google calendar says it\'s at 10 today
2016-01-04T15:03:49 <Justin_o> simonjb: hmm... so the calendar looks like it says 10am for the Floe meeting, but i thought we always did it at 11am
2016-01-04T15:03:58 <simonjb> yeah, me too
2016-01-04T15:04:02 <simonjb> it was 11 before
2016-01-04T15:04:08 <Justin_o> strange
2016-01-04T15:04:28 <Justin_o> anastasiac: any idea why the Floe Planning Meeting is at 10am on the calendar instead of 11am?
2016-01-04T15:04:55 <anastasiac> Justin_o: I was wondering about that myself; I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure if I was remembering incorrectly when we used to have it...
2016-01-04T15:05:23 <Justin_o> haha, i had that thought too for a minute
2016-01-04T15:06:09 <anastasiac> well, Justin_o, we should probably wait for michelle today
2016-01-04T15:06:27 <Justin_o> simonjb, anastasiac: i guess we can assume there is a problem with the calendar and expect to have the meeting at 11am today.

2016-01-04T17:17:45 <Justin_o> Bosmon: the GPII-1337 docs pull request is ready for more review https://github.com/GPII/docs-first-discovery/pull/3
2016-01-04T17:20:15 * michelled has quit
2016-01-04T17:23:10 <Bosmon> Thanks, Justin_o
2016-01-04T17:23:14 <Bosmon> I\'ll take a look
2016-01-04T17:23:22 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks

2016-01-04T17:40:54 <Justin_o> jhung: did you happen to come up with a range for the Charge values
2016-01-04T17:41:32 <Justin_o> so far i\'m using "no" = 0, "a small amount" < 34, "a moderate amount" < 67, "a large amount" >= 67
2016-01-04T17:41:42 <jhung> Justin_o: sorry I\'ve been working on the other descriptions.
2016-01-04T17:41:51 <jhung> Justin_o: that looks fine for the demo.
2016-01-04T17:42:08 <Justin_o> jhung: cool thanks

2016-01-04T18:01:06 <alanharnum> colinclark michelled Justin_o: made a wiki page at https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/First+Discovery+Server+Demo
2016-01-04T18:01:25 <alanharnum> in the process i also managed to get the "get a preference via FM" working
2016-01-04T18:02:27 <michelled> cool, thx alanharnum
2016-01-04T18:02:31 <alanharnum> so to sum up, you can go through the FD process, get a valid token, then use that to retrieve all the preferences you set (via the PS), or those for a specific application where they\'d be relevant (via FM)

2016-01-04T18:18:31 <Justin_o> clown: I\'m working on an html representation of a physics sim. Right now we are using sliders for moving a hand and foot. In this sim the foot rubs against the floor to build up electrons in the body. As the hand approaches the door knob the electrons will discharge from the hand. We\'re trying to find a way to represent the build up of the electrons.
2016-01-04T18:18:31 <Justin_o> Currently we have a read-only text field in the form with a category of the value (e.g. a small amount). http://localhost:7888/john-travoltage-html/
2016-01-04T18:18:43 <Justin_o> sorry, wrong url http://jobara.github.io/john-travoltage-html/
2016-01-04T18:19:11 <clown> Justin_o:  *looking*
2016-01-04T18:20:03 <Justin_o> clown: we\'re also thinking of updating the value text in the foot slider to indicate when a charge has been gained.
2016-01-04T18:20:05 <clown> Justin_o:  makes me think of a progress bar, but that\'s not quite right since it isn\'t progress.
2016-01-04T18:20:37 <Justin_o> clown: hmm.. could be, that\'s an interesting though
2016-01-04T18:20:38 <Justin_o> thought
2016-01-04T18:20:59 <clown> rhetorical question:  how does one represent (in a gui) sound levels on a recording deck.  They go up and down...
2016-01-04T18:21:00 <Justin_o> clown: there is a max and min amount of charge that can be gained
2016-01-04T18:21:35 <Justin_o> clown: might be a slider
2016-01-04T18:21:58 <clown> but a slider that the use doesn\'t directly control.
2016-01-04T18:22:03 <clown> *the user
2016-01-04T18:22:32 <Justin_o> clown: ah i thought you meant the volume controls themselves
2016-01-04T18:23:13 <clown> no, I mean the vertical columns in an equalizer that show the amplitude (?) of each band of frequencies.
2016-01-04T18:25:12 <clown> maybe it is a progress bar, but one where "progress" can increase and decrease as the user fiddles with the other controls.
2016-01-04T18:25:58 <clown> What other gui widgets show "quantity", or filling up at one time and depleting at another?
2016-01-04T18:27:21 <Justin_o> hmm.. good question.. i can\'t think of anything... maybe like a thermometer, but i think mostly they\'d just show the numbers
2016-01-04T18:28:50 <Justin_o> clown: maybe we could just make it an html meter
2016-01-04T18:29:22 <Justin_o> too bad the browser support isn\'t very good http://caniuse.com/#search=meter
2016-01-04T18:29:40 <Justin_o> sorry, it\'s good, just doesn\'t seem to cover all that we need it to
2016-01-04T18:30:28 <jhung> clown, that\'s an interesting thought of using a meter to indicate your quantity of charge.
2016-01-04T18:31:00 <clown> thanks jhung.
2016-01-04T18:31:40 <clown> Justin_o:  is that meter thing something like <input type="meter"> ?
2016-01-04T18:32:10 <jhung> Taking it a step further, it\'s almost like a breadcrumb where you can figure out how close or far you are from landmarks. The landmarks being "none, small, moderate, large, and maximum" number of charges.
2016-01-04T18:32:28 <Justin_o> clown: no, it\'s an actual element https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meter
2016-01-04T18:32:34 <clown> wow...
2016-01-04T18:33:28 * clown noting that the <meter> element has reached Rec status.
2016-01-04T18:33:44 * clown checking the AAPI mappings.
2016-01-04T18:34:49 <jhung> Justin_o: should we be concerned that iOS and IE don\'t support <meter>?
2016-01-04T18:35:15 <Justin_o> jhung: yes
2016-01-04T18:35:16 <Justin_o> :(
2016-01-04T18:35:27 <Justin_o> jhung: i\'m trying to see how they represent that element
2016-01-04T18:37:13 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2016-01-04T18:37:22 <Justin_o> jhung: looks like IE just treats it like a span
2016-01-04T18:37:28 <Justin_o> IE 11 that is
2016-01-04T18:37:47 <danayo> hi zamcnema, in response to your question about adding a preview button to the First Discovery tool - using an icon alone may be problematic given the context of the tool (first-time users etc)

2016-01-04T18:38:11 <Justin_o> jhung: but i guess we could see what clown finds out about the accessibility api mappings... that could suggest if we could use a progress bar or something else
