2016-01-22T16:27:21 <simonjb> cindyli1: do they pass for you?
2016-01-22T16:27:33 <simonjb> maybe I\'m missing something
2016-01-22T16:27:42 <cindyli1> simonjb: did you upgrade node to 4.2.1?
2016-01-22T16:27:49 <simonjb> ah!
2016-01-22T16:27:50 <simonjb> no
2016-01-22T16:27:57 <simonjb> hold on
2016-01-22T16:28:04 <simonjb> this is the browser test
2016-01-22T16:28:10 <simonjb> so should not matter
2016-01-22T16:28:23 <cindyli1> ah, web tests. let me try.
2016-01-22T16:29:26 <cindyli1> simonjb: all passed. what browser and which test failed?
2016-01-22T16:29:53 <simonjb> fail in Chrome and Firefox
2016-01-22T16:30:24 <cindyli1> simonjb: both passed on mine
2016-01-22T16:30:33 <cindyli1> strange. let me clear the cache again
2016-01-22T16:31:01 <cindyli1> btw, simonjb, the test i run - universal/gpii/node_modules/gpii-oauth2/gpii-oauth2-authz-server/webTests/all-tests.html
2016-01-22T16:31:11 <simonjb> actually, may be a problem with my infusion
2016-01-22T16:31:27 <simonjb> let me try wiping out my node-modules and reinstalling
2016-01-22T16:31:49 <cindyli1> ok, ya, need to reinstall so the new infusion etc can be re-fetched.
2016-01-22T16:33:36 <cindyli1> simonjb: I tried web/html/all-tests.html, AuthorizationServiceTests.html failed with this error: TypeError: fluid.contextAware is undefined

2016-01-22T18:25:50 <michelled> ah, who was reviewing them before?
2016-01-22T18:26:45 <anastasiac> there haven\xe2\x80\x99t been any in a very long time...

2016-01-22T18:28:43 <anastasiac> I\xe2\x80\x99ll ping him in the pull request, for now. We can check with him on Monday
2016-01-22T18:29:52 <michelled> cool
2016-01-22T18:31:26 <simonjb> cindyli: the AuthorizationServiceTests.html are now passing for me but I\'m still seeing an issue
2016-01-22T18:31:49 <simonjb> cindyli: the universal/tests/web/html/all-tests.html seems to get stuck and not finish
2016-01-22T18:32:13 <cindyli> simonjb: with both firefox and chrome?
2016-01-22T18:32:18 <cindyli> did you clear the cache?
2016-01-22T18:32:45 <cindyli> i modified the all-tests.html to run another all-tests.html for oauth components
2016-01-22T18:33:13 <cindyli> seems working fine on my machine
2016-01-22T18:34:02 <simonjb> it gets stuck with 3 panes: "GPII Universal framework complete tests runner", "oauth2 UI complete tests runner", and "Privacy Settings Test Suite"
2016-01-22T18:34:20 <simonjb> yes, both firefox and chrome and I cleared the caches
2016-01-22T18:34:35 <simonjb> and they are working for you?
2016-01-22T18:34:37 <simonjb> hmm
2016-01-22T18:34:46 <cindyli> interesting
2016-01-22T18:36:39 <cindyli> simonjb: would they work if you run them individually?
2016-01-22T18:36:51 <simonjb> maybe your change to all-tests.html is causing trouble -- running the test runner inside a test runner https://github.com/cindyli/universal/commit/85849baaba8dde59922e4a725af5e4b7745b9da5
2016-01-22T18:37:50 <cindyli> yes, that\'s the change i made to avoid the duplication of each test file being written in two runners
2016-01-22T18:38:01 <cindyli> would that cause trouble?
2016-01-22T18:38:21 <simonjb> don\'t know
2016-01-22T18:38:37 <simonjb> but actually I\'m having trouble with universal/gpii/node_modules/gpii-oauth2/gpii-oauth2-authz-server/webTests/all-tests.html
2016-01-22T18:38:53 <simonjb> getting stuck on Privacy Settings Test Suite
2016-01-22T18:39:03 <cindyli> ah ha. any error?
2016-01-22T18:40:11 <simonjb> ASSERTION FAILED:  Unable to look up name fluid.tabbable as a global function
2016-01-22T18:42:05 <simonjb> I\'m still running old Node.js so maybe it could be an issue on my computer and old npm when installing dependencies
2016-01-22T18:42:34 <simonjb> cindyli: ^
2016-01-22T18:43:41 <cindyli> simonjb: ok, did you have this issue before trying my new commit?
2016-01-22T18:44:27 <cindyli> simonjb: i mean at the time you saw "undefined contextAwareness"
2016-01-22T18:44:39 <simonjb> cindyli: I didn\'t get this far
2016-01-22T18:44:44 <cindyli> ok
2016-01-22T18:44:47 <simonjb> so first time seeing this issue
2016-01-22T18:44:53 <simonjb> I see other issues also
2016-01-22T18:45:10 <simonjb> GET fail for http://localhost/simon/gpii/node_modules/universal/gpii/node_modules/gpii-o\xe2\x80\xa6rver/public/src/components/privacySettings/js/editPrivacySettingsDialog.js
2016-01-22T18:45:31 <simonjb> in PrivacySettings-test.html
2016-01-22T18:46:25 <simonjb> actually just that and 2 instances of fluid.tabbable error

2016-01-22T18:52:27 * yzen_ joined the channel
2016-01-22T19:03:34 <cindyli> Bosmon: i made this change to run an all-tests.html inside another all-tests.html. it seems running fine. is there any other issues you can think of that we should NOT do this?
2016-01-22T19:03:42 <cindyli> https://github.com/cindyli/universal/commit/85849baaba8dde59922e4a725af5e4b7745b9da5#diff-7912c9b26aa39173c6764223ff673432
2016-01-22T19:04:31 <cindyli> the benefit of doing this is to avoid the same file list being written and maintained at multiple locations
2016-01-22T19:05:51 <Bosmon> cindyli - I imagine it will make it harder to integrate this with a CI server which is trying to run the tests
2016-01-22T19:06:02 <Bosmon> You should consult with avtar to see how he is planning to do this
2016-01-22T19:06:13 <cindyli> what is a CI server, Bosmon?
2016-01-22T19:06:20 <Bosmon> continuous integration
2016-01-22T19:06:24 <cindyli> ok
2016-01-22T19:06:48 <simonjb> for completeness, the issue I was having above was caused by a case-sensitivity mismatch -- html file referenced "editPrivacySettingsDialog.js" and file was called "EditPrivacySettingsDialog.js" small "e" vs big "E"
2016-01-22T19:07:20 <cindyli> avtar, gtirloni, alanharnum: could you have a look on our conversation above and\xe2\x80\xa6 thoughts?
2016-01-22T19:08:06 <simonjb> looks like my webserver is case sensitive but cindyli\'s is not (worked for her)
2016-01-22T19:08:56 <cindyli> ** looking up apache settings to make it more sensitive
2016-01-22T19:09:40 <alanharnum> i\'m not sure i totally understand the issue, but I think this is the issue cindyli https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_speling.html
2016-01-22T19:09:43 <avtar> cindyli: here\'s an example of how automated tests have been set up https://github.com/avtar/infusion/tree/GPII-1550#how-do-i-run-tests
2016-01-22T19:09:48 <alanharnum> er, i think that\'s your solution
2016-01-22T19:11:00 <avtar> cindyli: related changes https://github.com/avtar/infusion/commit/0f226e56725f1ebd6fdd5c27149b2fa3c22affa0 you may want to scroll all the way down to the \'tests/all-tests.html\' and \'tests/testem.json\' chages

2016-01-22T19:12:04 * clown joined the channel
2016-01-22T19:14:31 <cindyli> avtar: so if tests/all-tests.html collects and runs a bunch of other all-tests.html such as for framework module, component module etc, would that cause problem when running "tests/all-tests.html" in a CI server or any other issues you can think of
2016-01-22T19:14:47 <cindyli> we know "tests/all-tests.html" will be fine when running in browsers
2016-01-22T19:15:40 <cindyli> thanks alanharnum for the mod_spelling, looking into that
2016-01-22T19:17:28 <avtar> cindyli: not that i know of. as long as we can trigger tests from the command line and capture the reporting then jenkins doesn\'t have a preference
2016-01-22T19:17:46 <avtar> that\'s how the gpii/universal browser tests are set up to run using jenkins
2016-01-22T19:18:23 <gtirloni> cindyli: is your web server running on windows or macosx?
2016-01-22T19:18:31 <cindyli> macos, gtirloni
2016-01-22T19:18:56 <cindyli> thanks, avtar. seems now we have a green signal for this change. YAY!
2016-01-22T19:19:22 <simonjb> cindyli: https://github.com/cindyli/universal/pull/3
2016-01-22T19:19:40 <simonjb> cindyli: does not have doc updates -- will have those soon
2016-01-22T19:19:52 <cindyli> great. thanks, simonjb
2016-01-22T19:20:05 <gtirloni> is macosx case-insensitive by default?
2016-01-22T19:20:30 <cindyli> simonjb: can i merge this pull now? will you issue another pull request for the doc?
2016-01-22T19:20:36 <simonjb> cindyli: yes
2016-01-22T19:21:00 <cindyli> gtirloni: i don\'t recall i changed the case-insensitive setting, so i think by default case-insensitive with macos
2016-01-22T19:21:07 <cindyli> ok. thanks, simonjb
2016-01-22T19:21:58 <simonjb> it\'s either the filesystem is case-insensitive or apache could be configured with case-insensitivity turned on

2016-01-22T14:22:51 <Bosmon> non-use of ontology handler in prefs server: https://github.com/amb26/universal/blob/GPII-1318/gpii/node_modules/preferencesServer/src/preferencesPostHandler.js#L42
2016-01-22T14:23:14 <Bosmon> use of it: https://github.com/amb26/universal/blob/GPII-1318/gpii/node_modules/preferencesServer/src/preferencesGetHandler.js#L49
2016-01-22T14:23:54 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i'm trying to write a test case for that tooltip in the iframe issue i mentioned to you the other day. However, i'm running into a problem where it seems that my onCreate event handler is being triggered twice
2016-01-22T14:24:23 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i see this issue, but it seems like it should be fixed https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5559

2016-01-22T14:25:09 <Bosmon> Justin_o - this report refers to onTestCaseStart, not onCreate
2016-01-22T14:25:13 <Bosmon> onCreate can never be called more than once
2016-01-22T14:25:23 <Bosmon> If it is called more than once, there is more than one component being created
2016-01-22T14:25:32 <Justin_o> Bosmon: well i'm using onTestCaseStart to create my test component
2016-01-22T14:25:44 <Justin_o> so i'm assuming it's related
2016-01-22T14:25:58 <Justin_o> i'm just noticing that the handler bound to onCreate is being called twice
2016-01-22T14:26:01 <Bosmon> Justin_o - so in that case you might see two components being created
