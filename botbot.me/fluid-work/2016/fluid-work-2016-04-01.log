b'2016-04-01T16:33:22 <gloob> ok, great
2016-04-01T16:33:43 <the-t-in-rtf> OK, I don\'t see anything within JIRA\'s configuration that transitions on a PR.  I have always done that manually for my issues as well.
2016-04-01T16:33:47 <the-t-in-rtf> I think you still have to transition.
2016-04-01T16:34:06 <the-t-in-rtf> However, once the link is set up you\'ll see it in the right hand column in the issues and you\'ll see the commits in the commit tab  on the issue.
2016-04-01T16:34:40 <gloob> would be nice to trigger it automatically from github
2016-04-01T16:34:47 <gloob> after a PR with the ticket number
2016-04-01T16:35:01 <the-t-in-rtf> I think it\'s possible to set up
2016-04-01T16:35:11 <the-t-in-rtf> Send a note to the arch group and I\'ll do some digging on Monday
2016-04-01T16:35:25 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, here\'s an example of what the issue should look like if the link is set up:  https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-1253
2016-04-01T16:37:08 <the-t-in-rtf> A note like "Can we automatically transition GPII issues when a PR is submitted", for example...

2016-04-01T16:40:13 <colinclark> and he\'s just too modest to admit it

2016-04-01T17:54:19 <michelled> https://wiki.gpii.net/w/Architecture
2016-04-01T17:54:27 <michelled> https://wiki.gpii.net/w/Architecture_Dashboard
2016-04-01T17:54:38 <michelled> on the dashboard page, I\'ve added a section for diagrams
2016-04-01T17:55:02 <michelled> it links out to the google docs that we\'ve been passing around and which have become very important to the work we do in GPII
2016-04-01T17:55:24 <avtar> nice
2016-04-01T17:55:26 <avtar> thanks, michelled
2016-04-01T17:55:28 <michelled> Please start adding links to this page for anything that is relevant for people developing the GPII
2016-04-01T17:55:41 <michelled> cindyli: probably a link to your payloads is in order, for example :)
2016-04-01T17:56:31 <cindyli> good idea. michelled. the pages look great. lots of information. thanks for the good work
2016-04-01T17:57:28 <simonjb> thanks michelled

2016-04-01T18:07:02 <michelled> sounds good cindyli

2016-04-01T18:25:06 <dsharma> I was going through the code and noticed that we are not doing any exception handling in our code.
2016-04-01T18:26:48 <dsharma> If it will better to do the exception handling and log the message so we can have more detail about the problem if something un expected happen?
2016-04-01T18:27:09 <Bosmon> Hi there dsharma - thanks for the question
2016-04-01T18:27:23 <Bosmon> Exception handling is something that we tend to push into the framework layer
2016-04-01T18:28:16 <Bosmon> So, to start with, at the Windows API level, I\'m not aware that any exceptions are thrown - instead, the API style is to check return codes
2016-04-01T18:28:22 <Bosmon> Which are done at the following site: https://github.com/GPII/windows/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/WindowsUtilities/WindowsUtilities.js#L310
2016-04-01T18:28:36 <Bosmon> If we receive a non-zero return code, a message will be logged and a fatal exception will be triggered
2016-04-01T18:29:12 <Bosmon> At higher application levels, we register an uncaught exception handler within the base framework
2016-04-01T18:29:17 <Bosmon> This appears at this line: https://github.com/amb26/kettle/blob/KETTLE-32/lib/KettleUtils.js#L30
2016-04-01T18:29:44 <Bosmon> Eventually it dispatches to the following utility which will also cause a log and a fatal error: https://github.com/amb26/kettle/blob/KETTLE-32/lib/KettleUtils.js#L48
2016-04-01T18:30:06 <Bosmon> If you can find any sites within the architecture at which you think an exception will not cause a logged message, it would be very welcome if you can point them out
2016-04-01T18:33:55 <dsharma> Thanks Bosmon. I think using the framework ultimately we will log some message. My idea was to log low level info in function if that can be more helpful for analyzing
2016-04-01T18:34:14 <Bosmon> dsharma - yes, certainly such log messages are useful during the development process
2016-04-01T18:34:22 <Bosmon> YOu will find several such messages left lying around....
2016-04-01T18:35:06 <Bosmon> You might find the framework logging function http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/CoreAPI.html#fluid-log-loglevel-arg1-argn- useful
2016-04-01T18:35:19 <Bosmon> Although of course you are welcome to use console.log for quick and dirty logging
2016-04-01T18:35:32 <Bosmon> In general we strip out any console.log messages before a pull request is merged into the core architecture
2016-04-01T18:36:02 <dsharma> Thanks Bosmon will go through with these documents

2016-04-01T16:05:17 <gloob> I don\'t know if we are using that, to be honest
2016-04-01T16:07:15 <cindyli> gloob: can you expand your question?
2016-04-01T16:08:19 <gloob> cindyli: oh yes, I just saw that you updated that issue refering to a new PR creation in github
2016-04-01T16:08:45 <cindyli> gloob: right
2016-04-01T16:08:50 <gloob> in Jira the issues\'s workflow have a state that is Pull Request Created
2016-04-01T16:09:13 <gloob> I guess is just for that
2016-04-01T16:09:18 <gloob> and I\'m crazy for push the button
2016-04-01T16:09:34 <gloob> but I\'m polite and asking to you if that should be in that state or not, that I guess yes
2016-04-01T16:09:36 <cindyli> ah. ok, right. always forget that. thanks for reminding me. will update.
2016-04-01T16:09:43 <gloob> and my second question is, are we using it?
2016-04-01T16:09:46 <gloob> give any value?
2016-04-01T16:09:57 <gloob> that workflow state
2016-04-01T16:09:58 <cindyli> are we using gpii paylods u mean?
2016-04-01T16:10:01 <gloob> nono
2016-04-01T16:10:06 <gloob> that state, pull request stated
2016-04-01T16:10:13 <gloob> just talking about jira
2016-04-01T16:10:18 <cindyli> i c
2016-04-01T16:10:45 <cindyli> it\'s a helpful information, i think
2016-04-01T16:11:16 <gloob> well, I\'m creating a ton of new issues in Jira now
2016-04-01T16:11:31 <gloob> to model somehow what we need to do for installers and concretely windows installer
2016-04-01T16:11:36 <cindyli> i know with issues.fliudproject.org, jira states are automatically updated when an PR for them are issued
2016-04-01T16:11:42 <gloob> ah ok
2016-04-01T16:11:54 <gloob> could I press it and play with your issue? :-)
2016-04-01T16:12:00 <cindyli> certainly
2016-04-01T16:12:08 <gloob> (bow)
2016-04-01T16:12:26 <gloob> ok, this just change the state, nothing more
2016-04-01T16:12:31 <gloob> maybe it\'s not connected to github
2016-04-01T16:12:42 <gloob> thanks cindyli!
2016-04-01T16:13:38 <cindyli> maybe it is but only watching repos owned by "gpii". my pull request is against a repo owned by me
2016-04-01T16:13:51 <cindyli> thank YOU, gloob
2016-04-01T16:13:58 <gloob> \\o/
2016-04-01T16:14:42 * the-t-in-rtf joined the channel
2016-04-01T16:14:51 <gloob> let\'s see how we can connect that in the same way that fluid
2016-04-01T16:15:07 <gloob> the-t-in-rtf: T, hi, do you know if gpii jira is connected to github?
2016-04-01T16:15:21 <gloob> the-t-in-rtf: you are the first jira expert in my list :-)
2016-04-01T16:15:42 <gloob> we are discussing this: cindyli: should be transitioned to PR created this issue https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-1646 ?
2016-04-01T16:15:57 <gloob> the PR workflow of the issue and github
2016-04-01T16:16:02 <gloob> or anyone?
2016-04-01T16:17:42 <the-t-in-rtf> @gloob, yes, it is, but only for select projects and repositories.
2016-04-01T16:17:49 <gloob> I imagine that
2016-04-01T16:18:00 <the-t-in-rtf> And for the record, I only wrote a very small part of JIRA\xe2\x80\xa6 ;)
2016-04-01T16:18:00 <gloob> and how is the match?
2016-04-01T16:18:05 <gloob> project <-> repo?
2016-04-01T16:18:11 <the-t-in-rtf> I think so, let me check.
2016-04-01T16:18:19 <the-t-in-rtf> I am in the middle of cooking, so it may be a minute.
2016-04-01T16:18:20 <gloob> the-t-in-rtf: well, at least is more than the median
2016-04-01T16:18:21 <gloob> haha
2016-04-01T16:18:27 <gloob> the-t-in-rtf: no, problem, full async
2016-04-01T16:18:42 <gloob> but I wanted for the new installers works, and new projects
2016-04-01T16:19:17 <gloob> and the cindyli\'s issue appears and wanted to see what happens
2016-04-01T16:19:51 <gloob> the-t-in-rtf: are you in in CEST timezone?
2016-04-01T16:20:33 * sepidehshahi has quit
2016-04-01T16:22:18 * Blagoj joined the channel
2016-04-01T16:22:41 <the-t-in-rtf> Yes.
2016-04-01T16:23:19 <gloob> so is it dinner?
2016-04-01T16:23:27 <gloob> I\'m in post-lunch time xD
2016-04-01T16:23:35 <the-t-in-rtf> Yes, it\'s dinner.
2016-04-01T16:23:40 <gloob> awesome
2016-04-01T16:23:41 <the-t-in-rtf> Also my day off\xe2\x80\xa6
2016-04-01T16:23:48 <gloob> ouch
2016-04-01T16:23:57 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, she is merging a PR against master in her own repo
2016-04-01T16:24:02 <the-t-in-rtf> That repo is not tracked.
2016-04-01T16:24:11 <gloob> don\'t worry about this, we can talk in Monday
2016-04-01T16:24:16 <the-t-in-rtf> No, I know the answer.
2016-04-01T16:24:20 <gloob> where is the mapping set?
2016-04-01T16:24:46 <the-t-in-rtf> Under "DVCS Accounts" in the administration control panel.
2016-04-01T16:24:57 <the-t-in-rtf> I think it\'s global, any repo can reference any ticket.
2016-04-01T16:25:04 <the-t-in-rtf> sorry, a commit in any repo.
2016-04-01T16:25:32 <the-t-in-rtf> The problem in this case is that she\'s merging into https://github.com/cindyli/gpii-payloads
2016-04-01T16:25:40 * michelled joined the channel
2016-04-01T16:25:40 <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. her personal repo.
2016-04-01T16:25:42 <the-t-in-rtf> which isn\'t set up.
2016-04-01T16:26:41 <gloob> ah, true
2016-04-01T16:27:16 <gloob> so, any gpii githib group repo will trigger that workflow state?
2016-04-01T16:27:23 <gloob> s/githib/github
2016-04-01T16:28:11 <the-t-in-rtf> Any registered repo.
2016-04-01T16:28:35 <gloob> ok
2016-04-01T16:28:45 <gloob> the-t-in-rtf: good, thanks!
2016-04-01T16:29:02 <the-t-in-rtf> Not sure about the workflow state triggering, BTW, I didn\'t check that.
2016-04-01T16:29:11 <the-t-in-rtf> I only know why JIRA didn\'t know about that PR/commit
2016-04-01T16:29:27 <the-t-in-rtf> Ordinarily it would show up in the "commits" tab as well.
