2016-02-01T18:06:19 <jhung> ping alanharnum and anyone else - we\'re starting the Design Crit.
2016-02-01T18:07:21 <jhung> For design crit we\'re taking a look at this article I am working on about Modal dialogs and interactions: https://github.com/jhung/docs-inclusive-learning/blob/FLUID-5851/src/documents/ModalDialogs.md
2016-02-01T18:07:31 <alanharnum> is anyone else getting "Failed to establish connection with the router (error 1003)" when trying to connect to fluid_standup?
2016-02-01T18:07:58 <jhung> alanharnum: it\'s fine here.
2016-02-01T18:08:07 <alanharnum> ya i see Simon is on as well
2016-02-01T18:08:08 <jhung> simonjb has made it into the room
2016-02-01T18:15:28 <alanharnum> vidyo problem fixed by logging in through my laptop, then logging in on the desktop again
2016-02-01T18:15:44 <alanharnum> it took several minutes, but the laptop session was eventually booted and i was successfully logged in through desktop
2016-02-01T18:33:43 <sepidehshahi> alanharnum: now I got the 1003 error.
2016-02-01T18:49:44 <jhung> ping clown.
2016-02-01T18:52:31 <jhung> For someone implementing an accessible modal dialog, how should the "blocked" content be marked up using aria? aria-disabled doesn\'t seem appropriate in this case. Any thoughts?
2016-02-01T18:54:14 <clown> jhung, there is nothing currently in aria to indicate that a dialog is modal.
2016-02-01T18:54:33 <clown> there is discussion about adding an aria-modal attribute in ARIA 1.1
2016-02-01T18:54:50 <clown> jhung, how are desktop modal dialogs marked as "modal"?
2016-02-01T18:56:28 <jhung> clown, good question. I don\'t know. I can check. But how does this approach strike you? https://github.com/jhung/docs-inclusive-learning/blob/FLUID-5851/src/documents/ModalDialogs.md#html-and-aria-accessibility-guidelines-for-modal-dialogs
2016-02-01T18:57:02 <clown> re: the addition of aria-modal to 1.1, see:  https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/track/issues/568
2016-02-01T18:57:03 <jhung> *note, it\'s work in progress
2016-02-01T18:57:58 <clown> jhung, also:  http://rawgit.com/w3c/aria/master/core-aam/core-aam.html#ariaModalTrue
2016-02-01T18:58:30 <jhung> clown: Good to know. Thanks!
2016-02-01T18:58:31 <clown> jhung, it remains to be see if the browsers have implemented yet.
2016-02-01T18:58:45 <jhung> clown: ok
2016-02-01T18:59:06 * yzen has quit
2016-02-01T18:59:30 <jhung> But if someone were creating a modal "window" for web and using HTML and ARIA, how would they indicate that content in the background is disabled or obscured?
2016-02-01T18:59:34 <jhung> ^clown
2016-02-01T18:59:34 <clown> but, there is a desire by all stake holders that this be in place soon, jhung.  Likely late 1st quarter to early 2nd quarter this year.  (but don\'t quote me on that :-) )
2016-02-01T19:00:10 <jhung> That\'s pretty soon. I\'ll make sure to mention that in the doc I\'m writing clown.
2016-02-01T19:00:21 <jhung> well that there\'s a draft anyway.
2016-02-01T19:00:29 <clown> jhung, dojo, and I believe jQuery, just capture all mouse/key events and make sure the user cannot navigate outside of the dialog.
2016-02-01T19:01:08 <clown> html5 used to have an "inert" attribute just for this, but it was removed from their spec.
2016-02-01T19:01:30 <clown> but, you should check html5 drafts since it may have been added back.
2016-02-01T19:02:14 <clown> back to:  "jhung:  But if someone were creating a modal "window" for web and using HTML and ARIA, how would they indicate that content in the background is disabled or obscured?"  \xe2\x80\x94 I\'m thinking.
2016-02-01T19:02:16 <jhung> ah. "inert" sounds like the appropriate state. I\'ll check to see if they are adding that back clown.
2016-02-01T19:04:14 <clown> jhung, this may also provide some help:  http://rawgit.com/w3c/aria/master/practices/aria-practices.html#alertdialog

2016-02-01T19:07:11 <jhung> clown: thanks. There\'s both role dialog and alertdialog. Why is there a distinction?
2016-02-01T19:08:14 <clown> I think it goes all the way back to xerox parc, and the first GUIs.  Certainly Apple and Java made the distinction.
2016-02-01T19:08:33 <clown> Alert are sometimes known as system dialogs \xe2\x80\x94 the system posts them because of some issue.
2016-02-01T19:09:19 <clown> For example, if you quit an application but have unsaved changes, the system puts up a modal "alert" saying, "You have unsaved changes, save or quit?"
2016-02-01T19:09:54 <clown> that\'s different from a user requesting a dialog in order to, for example, make some settings changes.
2016-02-01T19:10:36 <clown> the former is used to alert the user as to some special condition.  the latter is invoked by the user for their own purposes.
2016-02-01T19:11:07 <clown> make sense?
2016-02-01T19:11:37 <jhung> Thanks clown. I\'ll mention those roles in the doc since users will want to know what to use one over the other.
2016-02-01T19:11:39 <clown> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alert_dialog_box
2016-02-01T19:15:34 <jhung> thanks. Aria-modal would simplify things a lot once it\'s implemented by all major browsers. If you come across any additional info on how to describe "inert" content, please pass it on clown.
2016-02-01T19:15:58 <clown> jhung, you\'re welcome.  I\'ll keep it mind.
2016-02-01T19:20:19 <jhung> clown, I came across this example. They use aria-hidden=true to hide the background page content when the modal dialog is present. https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wiki/Using_ARIA_role%3Ddialog_to_implement_a_modal_dialog_box
2016-02-01T19:20:53 <clown> well, I doubt it works with FF.
2016-02-01T19:30:44 <michelled> simonjb: are you able to meet now?
