b'2016-01-15T21:24:07 <cindyli> where? in the component or the test
2016-01-15T21:24:58 <Bosmon> cindyli - looks like it is just a typo actually
2016-01-15T21:25:02 <cindyli> i see, instead of using
2016-01-15T21:25:02 <cindyli> spec: {priority: "last:testing"},
2016-01-15T21:25:03 <Bosmon> You only use "spec" for changeEvents
2016-01-15T21:25:04 <cindyli> i should use
2016-01-15T21:25:09 <cindyli> priority: "last"
2016-01-15T21:25:11 <Bosmon> Yes
2016-01-15T21:25:14 <cindyli> cool
2016-01-15T21:25:19 <cindyli> trying
2016-01-15T21:25:51 <cindyli> yay!! genius Bosmon!!
2016-01-15T21:26:07 <cindyli> sometimes i do need another pair of eyes
2016-01-15T21:26:09 <Bosmon> Hardly genius to take 10 minutes to spot a typo : P
2016-01-15T21:26:54 <cindyli> oh, what a shame on me. it took me half an hour trying around and didn\'t even spot that ;)

2016-01-15T22:05:49 <cindyli> suggestions on a better name?

2016-01-15T12:53:40 <alanharnum> i\'m glad it was all successful (minus the internet connection)
2016-01-15T12:53:57 <alanharnum> all these networked applications would be so much easier if we didn\'t have to deal with the network :(

2016-01-15T13:12:03 <Justin_o> jhung: later on this year we might explore working on an interactive exemplar. I\'ve started a wiki page for ideas and best practices for this, but so far don\'t have much on the page. Please feel free to fill it out with anything you can think of https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Interactive+Exemplar+Brainstorming
2016-01-15T13:12:18 <Justin_o> and we should try to add to this over time too
2016-01-15T13:12:50 <jhung> sure Justin_o
2016-01-15T13:14:24 <Justin_o> thanks
2016-01-15T13:27:09 <Justin_o> Bosmon: does https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/654 completely fix all of the JIRAS mentioned in the various commits?

2016-01-15T14:02:20 <gtirloni> hi, where\'s the UIO meeting happening?
2016-01-15T14:02:42 <michelled> Bosmon, Justin_o ^
2016-01-15T14:03:01 <Bosmon> Justin_o - well you can verify the deduping stuff by checking out my branch of GPII universal, running npm install on it, and starting it
2016-01-15T14:03:50 <Bosmon> The node stack trace stuff can be checked by inserting a fluid.fail somewhere into a node all and then seeing what it looks like
2016-01-15T14:04:06 <Bosmon> Unfortunately these are two aspects of behaviour that are pretty hard to write test fixtures for
2016-01-15T14:04:07 <Justin_o> gtirloni: good, question.. fluid-standup okay?
2016-01-15T14:04:13 <gtirloni> cool

2016-01-15T15:13:31 <anastasiac> Justin_o: regarding the VIdeoPlayer test failing in my minification pull request: the failures seem to have been present already. Given that, and the fact that the VP is going to go through a significant upgrade, do you think we should worry about addressing these test failures as part of this minification pull request?
2016-01-15T15:13:58 <Justin_o> anastasiac: i think if there is nothing new that\'s fine
2016-01-15T15:14:10 <Justin_o> provided it still actually works
2016-01-15T15:14:57 <anastasiac> I\xe2\x80\x99ll have another round of running it through its paces manually, just in case, but the failures seem to be related to timing issues in the tests themselves.
2016-01-15T15:15:15 <anastasiac> Justin_o: the one thing that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work is the Amara retrieval, since they\xe2\x80\x99ve changed their API again. I\xe2\x80\x99ve filed a JIRA for that
2016-01-15T15:15:30 <Justin_o> anastasiac: okay, thanks
2016-01-15T15:15:37 <anastasiac> https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/VP-335
2016-01-15T15:15:43 <Justin_o> anastasiac: does that mean we had no transcripts?
2016-01-15T15:15:58 <anastasiac> for things that rely on Amara, yes
2016-01-15T15:16:05 <Justin_o> :(
2016-01-15T15:16:15 <Justin_o> do we have any time to fix that as well, or do you have an idea of how long that would take?
2016-01-15T15:17:00 <anastasiac> I can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine it would take horribly long, but I haven\xe2\x80\x99t looked into just how different the api is, yet
2016-01-15T15:17:09 <anastasiac> if it\xe2\x80\x99s just a different URL form, no problem
2016-01-15T15:17:20 <anastasiac> if it\xe2\x80\x99s a different sequence of communications, that\xe2\x80\x99s a bit more involved
2016-01-15T15:17:31 <anastasiac> I can have a quick look, to get a time estimate
2016-01-15T15:17:45 <anastasiac> but I suggest we do that under the separate JIRA, and not as part of this minification work, Justin_o
2016-01-15T15:22:49 <Justin_o> anastasiac: sure, just wondering if we could get to it in short order
2016-01-15T15:22:58 <anastasiac> I\xe2\x80\x99ll look at it today
2016-01-15T15:23:04 <Justin_o> anastasiac: thanks

2016-01-15T16:52:36 <gtirloni> found a little utility that creates an animation of repository activity
2016-01-15T16:52:52 <gtirloni> so i\'ve created one for gpii/universal just for fun: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Stt-rV_YPK8
2016-01-15T16:52:53 <Justin_o> gtirloni: sounds cool
2016-01-15T16:54:16 <gtirloni> infusion\'s git log was too big, so the 15GB video was a bit painful to upload, if anyone ones to try, this is the tool: gource.io
2016-01-15T16:55:37 <alanharnum> that\'s really neat
2016-01-15T16:56:29 <gtirloni> it should look in 1080p full screen too
2016-01-15T16:56:34 <gtirloni> +look good
2016-01-15T16:56:39 <alanharnum> surprise alanharnum appearance in the final five seconds!

2016-01-15T21:15:40 <cindyli> Bosmon: i have a component that has 2 sub-components being created at "afterRender". in the test, I use afterRender with priority "last:testing" to test their existence. the strange thing is they were not yet instantiated but the debugging msg tells that they somehow are instantiated later on after "last:testing"
2016-01-15T21:15:50 <cindyli> tried "last" as well, same
2016-01-15T21:16:12 <cindyli> might be something silly i did. let me get the code
2016-01-15T21:16:42 <cindyli> the creation of one subcomponent - https://github.com/cindyli/infusion/blob/FLUID-5837/src/framework/preferences/js/GpiiPanel.js#L90
2016-01-15T21:17:47 <cindyli> the test - https://github.com/cindyli/infusion/blob/FLUID-5837/tests/framework-tests/preferences/js/GpiiPanelTests.js#L84
2016-01-15T21:21:56 <Bosmon> cindyli - doesn\'t seem possible, really
2016-01-15T21:22:17 <cindyli> that\'s what i think. i use this all the time
2016-01-15T21:22:50 <Bosmon> Why don\'t you put a breakpoint in fluid.tests.gpiiPanel.testDefault and take a look at the list of listeners
2016-01-15T21:23:22 <Bosmon> ah wait
2016-01-15T21:23:30 <cindyli> i\'m thinking if it\'s related to the fact that afterRender is fired twice for fluid.prefs.panel. but that should only be for the composit panels
2016-01-15T21:23:39 <Bosmon> You\'re using the wacky IoCSS syntax for event registration...
2016-01-15T21:23:49 <cindyli> wacky??
