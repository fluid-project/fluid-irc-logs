2016-12-09T13:40:07 <jhung> Justin_o, Bosmon - I\'ve added the SVG to the PR 103 for infusion docs. https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/pull/103
2016-12-09T13:41:30 <jhung> * the SVG is in the comments.
2016-12-09T13:41:54 <Justin_o> Bosmon: I\'ll continue the review, after you\'ve had a chance to add that to the document
2016-12-09T14:02:02 <the-t-in-rtf> Morning.  How\'s it looking in Maryland?
2016-12-09T14:02:16 <the-t-in-rtf> I\'m waiting for Room 3 to open, just confirming that\'s the right place.

2016-12-09T17:39:28 <cindyli> gtirloni, i got ur msg about the web test failure on PrivacySettings-test.html
2016-12-09T17:40:40 <cindyli> would you be able to run this test in a browser on linux?

2016-12-09T17:48:42 * alanharnum joined the channel
2016-12-09T17:50:17 <gtirloni> cindyli: it passes when i run it directly on the browser
2016-12-09T17:51:31 <cindyli> gtirloni: right, it fails when it gets run as a part of all-tests.html, i believe it\'s related to the QUnit running all tests environment. i sometimes have the same issue with firefox on mac
2016-12-09T17:52:25 <cindyli> but i haven\'t seen this failure with CI
2016-12-09T17:52:49 <gtirloni> i believe CI was using firefox 48 up until recently
2016-12-09T17:53:58 * alanharnum has quit
2016-12-09T17:55:16 <gtirloni> cindyli: i just ran it again in the VM through `grunt tests` and it passed. might be a flaky test... i guess we can wait the next PR update that gets submitted
2016-12-09T17:57:21 <cindyli> gtirloni: has our CI VM been updated to use the new version of firefox? if I run "grunt tests" with my universal VM, do i need to fetch the new VM to use firefox 50?
2016-12-09T17:58:03 <gtirloni> yes, it has
2016-12-09T17:58:28 <gtirloni> you can update firefox by running: vagrant ssh -c "sudo dnf update -y firefox"
