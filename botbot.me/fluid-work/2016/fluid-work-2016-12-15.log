2016-12-15T17:22:08 <Justin_o> colinclark: for https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6094, I was talking to michelled and we were thinking of swapping the VP box for chart authoring. What do you think?

2016-12-15T17:47:03 <colinclark> chart authoring would be great
2016-12-15T17:48:24 <Justin_o> colinclark: thanks, i\'ll update that JIRA with that
2016-12-15T17:49:27 <michelled> colinclark: on a similar topic - do you think we should continue to use our VP on our sites?
2016-12-15T17:49:33 <michelled> it locks us to a very old version of UIO
2016-12-15T17:50:05 <michelled> hmmm\xe2\x80\xa6 I suppose we could use our VP without the UIO integration
2016-12-15T17:50:13 <michelled> Justin_o: maybe that\'s what we should do?
2016-12-15T17:50:36 <colinclark> which sites, specifically?
2016-12-15T17:50:44 <Justin_o> michelled: hmm.. that\'s an option, i can\'t remember how it tries to inject into UIO
2016-12-15T17:50:50 <colinclark> I mean, the answer to that question is essentially universal at this point, as much as it pains me
2016-12-15T17:50:52 <colinclark> "use youtube"
2016-12-15T17:51:19 <Justin_o> colinclark: http://inclusivedesign.ca and I think the snow site
2016-12-15T17:51:23 <Justin_o> not sure about others
2016-12-15T17:57:29 <Justin_o> cindyli: i updated the FLOE-494 PR

2016-12-15T16:21:25 <stegru> i\'ll have a quick look at it, i\'ve been working in the display settings handler already
2016-12-15T16:23:30 * alanharn_ has quit
2016-12-15T16:24:12 <cindyli> Justin_o: for the wordpress plugin, i found when using the wordpress admin feature to manage plugins, there\'s an "EDIT" feature to allow users to edit the source code of that plugin, but the edit window only detects files in the plugin root dir, not sub-dirs. one disadvantage of moving html, css, js, php into their own subdirectories is those files become un-editable thru wordpress admin interface
2016-12-15T16:24:38 <cindyli> but i\'m not sure how many ppl would really use that interface to alter source code
2016-12-15T16:25:07 <cindyli> a convenient way for small tweaks maybe
2016-12-15T16:30:18 <Justin_o> cindyli: good question
2016-12-15T16:32:03 <cindyli> Justin_o: so the question is, how do we weigh in whether or not to move files into sub-dirs?
2016-12-15T16:32:33 * colinclark_ joined the channel
2016-12-15T16:33:12 <cindyli> i personally think it\'s a cleaner structure using sub dirs, but we might introduce confusion to plugin admins that uio wordpress plugin only has one source code file, Justin_o
2016-12-15T16:33:49 * colinclark has quit
2016-12-15T16:33:49 * colinclark_ is now known as colinclark
2016-12-15T16:33:52 <gtirloni> yeah, wp\'s code editor is extremely limited
2016-12-15T16:34:04 <gtirloni> is it expected webdev\'s will be editing the uio code frequently?
2016-12-15T16:34:19 <gtirloni> if not, this might be a good alternative if someone is doing active development from within WP: https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-code-editor/
2016-12-15T16:35:17 <cindyli> gtirloni: this editor seems able to detect code from subdirs
2016-12-15T16:35:20 <cindyli> nice
2016-12-15T16:47:51 <Justin_o> cindyli, gtirloni: i\'m not sure what the expectation is for editing the plugin code
2016-12-15T16:49:18 <Justin_o> but i guess it would help a user to edit the setting and configuration of UIO until https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLOE-495

2016-12-15T17:07:07 <Justin_o> cindyli: well that was more of a reason to go back to all the files being at root level, at least until we expose the options through the WP interface
2016-12-15T17:08:44 <cindyli> well\xe2\x80\xa6 ok. r u going to update the pull request, Justin_o

2016-12-15T17:09:51 <Justin_o> cindyli: sure i will, if you think that\'s the best thing to do.. i\'m just guessing at what\'s best in this case as I don\'t know much about WP Plugin usage
2016-12-15T17:10:09 <Justin_o> but it seems easier for the plugin user if it\'s not in subdirectories
2016-12-15T17:10:18 <cindyli> Justin_o: i\'m not sure if that\'s the best thing to do tho
2016-12-15T17:11:05 <Justin_o> cindyli: okay, what is your recommendation
2016-12-15T17:12:47 <cindyli> with this wordpress feature, it seems wordpress encourages to use root dir, although i feel it might be problematic with a plugin having many files. i wanna ask if you have a preferred way, Justin_o
2016-12-15T17:17:16 <Justin_o> cindyli: hmm.. in terms of me being the plugin author I\'d rather have them in subdirectories... but if I\'m the plugin user who also wants to change the UIO configuration / settings, i\'d probably want to be able to use the WP feature to edit the plugin
2016-12-15T17:17:19 <Justin_o> i think
2016-12-15T17:18:24 <cindyli> Justin_o: sounds better to switch back to root dir
