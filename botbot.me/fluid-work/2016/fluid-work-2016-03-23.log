b'2016-03-23T15:17:25 <dins> things like writing research papers about work
2016-03-23T15:17:34 <dins> or any other work
2016-03-23T15:17:56 <dins> I just wanted to know
2016-03-23T15:20:54 <michelled> you\'ll need to write some accompanying documentation
2016-03-23T15:20:54 * kasparnet has quit
2016-03-23T15:21:27 <Justin_o> dins: well the work you are required to do would all be related to the project, for example weekly update/progress report (e.g. a blog post) and documentation at the end.

2016-03-23T16:47:59 <Awesome_A> I submitted a draft proposal at GSoc site
2016-03-23T16:48:12 <Awesome_A> Please I need feedback

2016-03-23T17:19:51 <wale> qq colinclark
2016-03-23T17:20:03 <colinclark> hey wale
2016-03-23T17:20:05 <wale> or perhaps the larger team
2016-03-23T17:20:06 <colinclark> how\'s it going?
2016-03-23T17:20:09 <wale> good good
2016-03-23T17:20:28 <wale> wondering if we have workstations issued for any GPII work?
2016-03-23T17:21:56 <colinclark> wale: Can you elaborate? What do you mean by "issued?"
2016-03-23T17:22:47 <wale> dedicated machines intended for development
2016-03-23T17:28:03 <kasparnet> wale: I think we have scripts to set up VMs
2016-03-23T17:28:12 <colinclark> It\'s getting quite nice in that regard
2016-03-23T17:28:18 <colinclark> Clone the repository
2016-03-23T17:28:22 <colinclark> and run "vagrant up"
2016-03-23T17:28:24 <colinclark> and that\'s about it
2016-03-23T17:28:59 <colinclark> There is also an installer, but probably not suitable for development--only for testing it
2016-03-23T17:33:18 <gloob> and we have the machines where jenkins deploy?
2016-03-23T17:33:26 <colinclark> yes, that\'s true too, gloob
2016-03-23T17:33:31 <colinclark> using the same vagrant infrastructure
2016-03-23T17:34:07 <gloob> wale: we have some continuous integration (CI) with jenkins
2016-03-23T17:34:16 <gloob> is interesting because all the tests should run there
2016-03-23T17:34:22 <gloob> I don\'t know current state, to be honest
2016-03-23T17:35:00 <gloob> wale: but the main question is like colinclark pointed, for what? :-D
2016-03-23T17:35:41 <colinclark> gloob: avtar can tell you all about the current state of the CI work
2016-03-23T17:36:04 <gloob> avtar: is it documented or reported the progress somewhere?
2016-03-23T17:36:26 <gloob> I saw and have the jenkins url but not the MASTER PLAN
2016-03-23T17:36:26 <avtar> gloob: https://github.com/gpii/ci-service
2016-03-23T17:36:29 <gloob> chan chan
2016-03-23T17:36:30 <gloob> MASTER
2016-03-23T17:36:32 <gloob> PLAN
2016-03-23T17:36:35 <gloob> :-P
2016-03-23T17:37:02 * kasparnet has quit
2016-03-23T17:37:14 <gloob> avtar: ok, cool
2016-03-23T17:37:34 <avtar> please let me know if there\'s anything that doesn\'t seem clear
2016-03-23T17:37:42 <gloob> sure I will
2016-03-23T17:38:05 * kasparnet joined the channel
2016-03-23T17:38:11 <gloob> avtar: are you free to build a team of 2 or 3 people to think about this?
2016-03-23T17:38:17 <gloob> I think it could work
2016-03-23T17:39:16 <avtar> gloob: i\'m not sure what "this" is :P
2016-03-23T17:39:34 <gloob> CI/CD for GPII and specially for APCP project :-D
2016-03-23T17:39:44 <avtar> ah ok
2016-03-23T17:40:13 <gloob> or invite me if is stablished that team <forever alone sticker>
2016-03-23T17:41:21 <avtar> kasparnet is the info from your google doc on the gpii wiki? or can gloob be invited as an editor?
2016-03-23T17:41:34 <gloob> I think I have that document
2016-03-23T17:42:52 * styki has quit
2016-03-23T17:42:55 <avtar> gloob: i\'ve primarily been doing the ci work. it sounds like amatas will be tackling a few of the tasks in kasparnet\'s doc. alanharnum and gtirloni did some of the cd work that builds and deploys docker containers for gpii components such as the preferences server and flow manager
2016-03-23T17:43:35 <avtar> as stated in kasparnet\'s doc the cd pieces will be moved to the gpii jenkins server so that process will be more transparent going forward
2016-03-23T17:46:17 <gloob> avtar: ok, thanks for the summary
2016-03-23T17:47:18 <avtar> gloob: np
2016-03-23T17:47:32 <avtar> we\'ll be sure to ping you for any upcoming ci/cd discussions
2016-03-23T17:48:21 <gloob> avtar: ok, thumbs up

2016-03-23T18:10:24 <gloob> the problem I see
2016-03-23T18:10:51 <gloob> is that we don\'t consolidate so much, IMHO

I would appreciate some help from you as I am also into writing WebRTC proposal as you suggested.

2016-03-23T13:35:01 <PaliwalSparsh> @Justin_o What do you think should we include integration testing in the project using IoC testing framework. I feel for the summers that might be too much for the timeline.

2016-03-23T13:40:54 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: if you don\'t think you have time, i guess mention that and why, and maybe a reason for why it is being pushed off and if there are plans to address it afterwards as part of the ongoing contribution stuff you mentioned.. something like that i guess

2016-03-23T13:46:10 <PaliwalSparsh> @Justin_o I have actually sometime towards the last week but I have no idea about the time involved in writing these tests. Unit tests are relatively straight forward, I have never got my hands dirty with integration testing.
2016-03-23T13:50:12 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: okay
