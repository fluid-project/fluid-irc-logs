2016-06-03T14:06:31 <Justin_o> hello
2016-06-03T14:12:12 * danayo joined the channel
2016-06-03T14:16:45 <kasparnet> morning avtar and gtirloni
2016-06-03T14:16:50 <gtirloni> hi!
2016-06-03T14:16:55 <gtirloni> good morning
2016-06-03T14:16:55 <avtar> hey kasparnet
2016-06-03T14:17:07 <kasparnet> I'm trying to make a test that involves the preferences server (in production mode)
2016-06-03T14:17:44 <kasparnet> and tony atkins has build this nice little pouchdb repo to make that possible
2016-06-03T14:18:07 * clown joined the channel
2016-06-03T14:18:09 <kasparnet> but I need to fill the pouchdb with entries along the lines of those we have in our couchdb
2016-06-03T14:18:25 <kasparnet> is there any way to see the actual entries?
2016-06-03T14:19:13 <gtirloni> preferences.gpii.net is loaded with data from GPII/universal/testData
2016-06-03T14:19:56 <gtirloni> or do you mean access the couchdb console?
2016-06-03T14:20:09 <kasparnet> yeah - the latter
2016-06-03T14:20:16 <kasparnet> ... or, I dont know if it's necessary
2016-06-03T14:20:23 <kasparnet> i take it the DB name is called preferences
2016-06-03T14:20:33 <kasparnet> and the _id of each entry would contain the token
2016-06-03T14:20:42 <kasparnet> but what is the content keyed by?
2016-06-03T14:21:04 <kasparnet> (ie. the stuff you get presented with when you go to a URL like http://preferences.gpii.net/preferences/carla
2016-06-03T14:22:28 <gtirloni> inside the VM you should be able to go to http://localhost:5984/_utils and see that i think
2016-06-03T14:23:04 * alanharnum joined the channel
2016-06-03T14:24:38 <gtirloni> if shouldn't ask for a password.. but if it does, it's probably couchdb/couchdb
2016-06-03T14:24:51 <avtar> kasparnet: regarding access to preferences.gpii.net's futon, there really shouldn't be any data in the preferences.gpii.net instance that isn't in the git repo
2016-06-03T14:26:22 <avtar> whenever it's deployed all data gets overwritten by what's in the testData directory
2016-06-03T14:27:26 <avtar> this https://github.com/gpii-ops/ansible-preferences-server-data-loader/blob/master/tasks/deploy.yml#L22 is how those test preference sets get uploaded
2016-06-03T14:27:38 * colinclark joined the channel
2016-06-03T14:28:16 <avtar> before that each set has an _id property added as you mentioned https://github.com/gpii-ops/ansible-preferences-server-data-loader/blob/master/templates/uploadedData.j2
2016-06-03T14:29:37 <kasparnet> gtirloni, avtar: ok cheers! I'll try it out and get back to you if I get stuck again (which is quite likely :) )
2016-06-03T14:30:10 <gtirloni> :)
