b'2016-01-05T17:12:30 <michelled> thx jhung
2016-01-05T17:17:18 <Justin_o> zamcnema: hope i\'m getting the right person here, this is the link to an example of a prefs editor with preview http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/tests/manual-tests/framework/preferences/fullPage-schema/
2016-01-05T17:18:03 <Justin_o> and the component for it is here https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/preferences/js/FullPreviewPrefsEditor.js
2016-01-05T17:18:43 <Justin_o> and the preview component itself https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/preferences/js/PrefsEditor.js#L478
2016-01-05T17:21:51 <alanharnum> michelled: after a quick chat with colinclark and gtirloni i\'m going to spend a little time this afternoon looking at the functioning of https://github.com/GPII/gpii-wix-installer in a Windows VM
2016-01-05T17:22:19 <alanharnum> want to check i\'m not overlapping work with you by doing this - this will just be short exploration, nothing substantial
2016-01-05T17:24:22 <michelled> nope - you aren\'t alanharnum
2016-01-05T17:24:34 <alanharnum> okay cool - thanks michelled
2016-01-05T17:26:47 <brendan_d> cindyli: hi cindy im back if you are able to continue that would be great
2016-01-05T17:30:34 <cindyli> sure, brendan_d
2016-01-05T17:30:46 <brendan_d> great
2016-01-05T17:31:32 <brendan_d> so the las thing i did was add gpii.firstDiscovery.panel.confirm in panels.js
2016-01-05T17:32:12 <cindyli> ok. what\'s the next? to customize the template?
2016-01-05T17:32:22 <brendan_d> yea
2016-01-05T17:32:57 <brendan_d> right now, im still using the yesNo.html code inside of confirmTemplate.heml
2016-01-05T17:33:56 <cindyli> brendan_d: finding docs about the renderer component
2016-01-05T17:34:26 <cindyli> brendan_d: http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/Renderer.html
2016-01-05T17:36:04 <cindyli> panels use renderer component "fluid.rendererComponent" to render templates. i didn\'t see the confirm page but i think it probably lists all user selected preferences
2016-01-05T17:36:45 <cindyli> in that case, you probably need one selector being repeatedly rendered for each preference
2016-01-05T17:36:56 * michelled has quit
2016-01-05T17:37:44 <brendan_d> cindyli: yes thats the goal. presenting the preferences back to them, and links to take them back to the previous panels where chages can be made
2016-01-05T17:38:37 <cindyli> ok. let me see if i can find a code example. in the meantime, you can read about the renderer component
2016-01-05T17:38:47 <brendan_d> ok
2016-01-05T17:41:25 * kasparnet has quit
2016-01-05T17:47:14 * clown has quit
2016-01-05T17:47:31 <cindyli> brendan_d: what kind of html elements do you plan to render those prefs? checkboxes, radio buttons or static html?
2016-01-05T17:48:11 <cindyli> or links?
2016-01-05T17:49:06 <brendan_d> its going to have links.
2016-01-05T17:49:30 * clown joined the channel
2016-01-05T17:49:43 <brendan_d> it will have the preference and then the selection, where the preference is a link to a previous panel where they can change it
2016-01-05T17:50:01 <cindyli> ok
2016-01-05T17:50:10 <brendan_d> i.e. Language: English, where \'language\' is a link
2016-01-05T17:51:14 * michelled joined the channel
2016-01-05T17:51:29 * kasparnet joined the channel
2016-01-05T17:54:01 * michelled has quit
2016-01-05T17:54:08 * anastasiac has quit
2016-01-05T17:59:41 <cindyli> brendan_d: all perfs selection can be found at "{prefsEditor}.model.preferences" that would be an object like {"gpii_firstDiscovery_speak": true, \xe2\x80\xa6}
2016-01-05T18:01:14 <cindyli> in ur template, you can have a div for the preference row
2016-01-05T18:02:40 <cindyli> in the panel component, an event handler can be added for the "afterRender" event. It loops thru the object, clone the div, and fill up the preference and the selection
2016-01-05T18:03:46 <cindyli> the hard part is to figure out which pref is associated with which panel
2016-01-05T18:06:01 <brendan_d> where exactly are the prefrence selections?
2016-01-05T18:06:32 <brendan_d> im confused how to get tehre
2016-01-05T18:07:18 <cindyli> https://github.com/GPII/first-discovery/blob/master/src/js/firstDiscoveryEditor.js#L71
2016-01-05T18:08:01 <cindyli> brendan_d: "prefsEditor" is a subcomponent of the tool
2016-01-05T18:08:26 <brendan_d> ok
2016-01-05T18:08:28 <cindyli> the selections are reflected and saved into prefsEditor.model.preferences
2016-01-05T18:08:48 <cindyli> the way to access it on the component tree is "{prefsEditor}.model.preferences"
2016-01-05T18:13:17 <brendan_d> oki think im following. so i need to create an event handler that loops though the object by using "{prefsEditor}.model.preferences"?
2016-01-05T18:17:25 <cindyli> brendan_d: i was talking to Justin_o just now, actually instead of using the event handler, you can use the renderer expander to repeatedly render each pref. the doc - http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/RendererComponentTreeExpanders.html
2016-01-05T18:24:17 <brendan_d> cindyli: im a bit confused by this, why is it necessary to repeatedly render each preference?
2016-01-05T18:26:34 <Justin_o> brendan_d: cindyli means that you can use the renderers repeat expander... it will allow you to render out all the "repeated" elements for example, this might be a list of preferences and their values. so each list item would be the repeated part with each preference represented.
2016-01-05T18:26:38 <Justin_o> did that make sense?
2016-01-05T18:28:11 <Justin_o> brendan_d: here\'s the direct link to the repetition expander http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/RendererComponentTreeExpanders.html#repetition-expander
2016-01-05T18:28:20 * jtworkme joined the channel
2016-01-05T18:28:50 <brendan_d> ok i think i understand
2016-01-05T18:29:11 * kasparnet has quit
2016-01-05T18:29:45 <brendan_d> so when would each repeat take place?
2016-01-05T18:33:15 * anastasiac joined the channel
2016-01-05T18:33:30 <cindyli> brendan_d: the repeat is handled automatically by the renderer component at component instantiation
2016-01-05T18:34:22 <brendan_d> so would this be when a preference is selected?
2016-01-05T18:34:47 <cindyli> in cases where you\'d like to manually trigger a re-rendering, your can call a component method refreshView()
2016-01-05T18:35:15 <cindyli> brendan_d: the first discovery tool is set up in the way that all panels are re-rendered when any preference is changed
2016-01-05T18:36:38 <cindyli> so that the selected pref can be applied to the entire tool. such as when the contrast is modified, the entire tool and all panels will pick up that change
2016-01-05T18:36:40 <brendan_d> cindyli: yes i understand that. but this page would not be changing any of the preferences. it is only a list of the preference values at that point
2016-01-05T18:37:05 <cindyli> that\'s true, but you still want the changed pref to be reflected on the panel
2016-01-05T18:38:08 <cindyli> on the confirm panel i meant
2016-01-05T18:38:09 <cindyli> brendan_d: Justin_o and i will be back in 20 mins
2016-01-05T18:38:28 <brendan_d> ok

2016-01-05T19:40:05 <cindyli> yes, do you have questions about that?
2016-01-05T19:42:42 <brendan_d> well since this is about rendering, im not sure how it will help to display the values of the preferences in a string like on, off, or numeric value
2016-01-05T19:53:06 * Jess_ joined the channel
2016-01-05T19:57:46 <cindyli> brendan_d: the displayed values can be customized with the repetition expander: http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/RendererComponentTreeExpanders.html#example

2016-01-05T20:43:23 <jhung> hey colinclark. I\'m wondering if there are any wicked presentations you have given in the past that I can leverage in my meetings with EdReady later this month?
2016-01-05T20:43:44 <colinclark> I have some stuff, yes
2016-01-05T20:43:51 <colinclark> I don\'t know whether they\'re wicked-worthy or not
2016-01-05T20:43:58 <colinclark> but I can share some ideas and some old presentation
2016-01-05T20:43:59 <colinclark> s
2016-01-05T20:44:20 <colinclark> the one challenge is that I often just use pictures or quotes or other "mental triggers" in my slides
2016-01-05T20:44:25 <colinclark> so that they\'re not super descriptive
2016-01-05T20:44:28 <jhung> I\'d settle for mildly wicked, or chaotic neutral colinclark.
2016-01-05T20:44:33 <colinclark> hahaha
2016-01-05T20:45:02 <colinclark> I have a few older ones on web accessibility and ARIA that are pretty much useful as-is
2016-01-05T20:45:06 <colinclark> though they\'d need to be updated a bit
2016-01-05T20:45:10 <jhung> colinclark: they\'re all on the wiki?
2016-01-05T20:45:16 <colinclark> I\'ll have to check
2016-01-05T20:45:28 <colinclark> is it ok if I send you some stuff later in the day?
2016-01-05T20:45:50 <colinclark> I also have some stuff on inclusive design methods and on Infusion and the Fluid community that may be helpful
2016-01-05T20:46:10 <jhung> Awesome. Later is fine colinclark.
2016-01-05T20:46:16 <colinclark> what kinds of topics do you think you want to cover with the EdReady team, jhung?
2016-01-05T20:47:14 <jhung> colinclark: aria is a good one. I know they have some interactive content, but they\'re in Flash I think.
2016-01-05T20:47:59 <colinclark> Justin_o and I gave a talk about ARIA and HTML5 a few years ago
2016-01-05T20:48:13 <colinclark> it\'s, again, dated, but probably has useful stuff in it that you could adapt and expand upon
2016-01-05T20:48:38 <colinclark> even older is a full-day accessibility workshop that we gave to the Jasig/uPortal community
2016-01-05T20:48:43 <jhung> ok. What I\'m hoping to do is see what topics you\'ve covered and the tailor something specifically for EdReady once we\'ve had a chat w them later this week.
2016-01-05T20:48:59 <colinclark> but I think it covered everything from models of accessibility to labelling and markup-based accessibility techniques to ARIA
2016-01-05T20:49:04 <colinclark> cool
2016-01-05T20:49:14 <colinclark> I\'m happy to talk through it if you want, too
2016-01-05T20:49:37 <colinclark> though I will be quite scarce for the next few weeks, but I can pop up next week after you\'ve talked to EdReady
2016-01-05T20:49:57 <colinclark> or i can just give you the raw material and you can rock it from there
2016-01-05T20:50:14 <colinclark> Justin_o is really good at this stuff, too, so he\'ll probably have lots of ideas for what to cover
2016-01-05T20:50:47 <jhung> colinclark: that would be generous. How about you give me the raw stuff and I\'ll shoot you an email if I need anything?
2016-01-05T20:50:57 <jhung> and yes, Justin_o is available too.

2016-01-05T15:08:26 * clown joined the channel
2016-01-05T15:09:19 <Justin_o> brendan_d: hello, i could probably help in a bit,  just in a meeting at the moment. Maybe cindyli might be able to give you a bit of help in the meantime
2016-01-05T15:10:27 <brendan_d> ok thanks
2016-01-05T15:11:48 <cindyli> brendan_d: if you look into schema.js, all templates are sitting in src/html/ directory - https://github.com/GPII/first-discovery/blob/master/src/schemas/schemas.js#L28
2016-01-05T15:12:52 <cindyli> brendan_d: finding some docs for you for adding a new panel \xe2\x80\xa6
2016-01-05T15:13:21 <brendan_d> i created a new panel alread y using this tutorial http://acheetham.github.io/docs-first-discovery/adding.html
2016-01-05T15:13:34 <brendan_d> currently i have a panel with a yesNo template
2016-01-05T15:14:00 <cindyli> cool
2016-01-05T15:15:04 <cindyli> brendan_d: so are you looking for ways to replace the yesNo template with your own template?
2016-01-05T15:15:53 <cindyli> btw, brendan_d, here\'s the formal site for the first discovery docs - http://gpii.github.io/docs-first-discovery/
2016-01-05T15:16:09 <brendan_d> yes. the yesNo template doesnt fit what i need this panel to do, which is display the previously selected preferences in list
2016-01-05T15:17:53 <brendan_d> im looking to try to either change the template for this panel to an already existing one that could accomidate this, or to make a custom one
2016-01-05T15:19:12 <cindyli> brendan_d: this would depend on the design of the confirmation page, i think very likely you need to make a custom one
2016-01-05T15:19:50 <cindyli> brendan_d: do you have a link to the design of the confirmation page?
2016-01-05T15:20:08 <brendan_d> cindyli: yea i figured that would be the more likely option
2016-01-05T15:21:15 <cindyli> ok, brendan_d, to replace yesNo template with your own custom one, two steps:
2016-01-05T15:21:49 <cindyli> 1. place your own template in src/html directory
2016-01-05T15:22:21 <cindyli> 2. modify the corresponding panel definition in schema.js to point to your own template.
2016-01-05T15:23:06 <cindyli> given the example of swapping out the template for the congrats panel, modify this line in schema.js - https://github.com/GPII/first-discovery/blob/master/src/schemas/schemas.js#L153
2016-01-05T15:23:17 <cindyli> the new line looks like:
2016-01-05T15:23:30 <cindyli> "template": "%templatePrefix/confirmationTemplate.html",
2016-01-05T15:23:49 <cindyli> does this make sense, brendan_d?
2016-01-05T15:25:01 <brendan_d> cindyli: yes it does, this was brought up in the tutorial i did previously when adding the yesNo template to the panel
2016-01-05T15:25:35 <cindyli> ok
2016-01-05T15:26:41 <brendan_d> cindyli: then after the template is created, i need to structure the message json file to fit it right?
2016-01-05T15:27:11 <cindyli> exactly, brendan_d. also, you need to create your own panel component to work with your custom template, then change schema.js to hook up that component
2016-01-05T15:27:28 <cindyli> it will be this line for the congrats panel - https://github.com/GPII/first-discovery/blob/master/src/schemas/schemas.js#L151
2016-01-05T15:28:45 <brendan_d> cindyli: so something like "gpii.firstDiscovery.panel.confirm"
2016-01-05T15:28:50 * simonjb joined the channel
2016-01-05T15:28:52 <cindyli> that\'s right
2016-01-05T15:32:27 <brendan_d> cindyli: alright im going to start by creating a template html file and linking the panel to it
2016-01-05T15:32:50 <cindyli> cool. let us know if you have questions, brendan_d
2016-01-05T15:36:09 <brendan_d> cindyli: what about the panel container? we changed the type to "gpii.firstDiscovery.panel.confirm" but do i need to change the container option?
2016-01-05T15:36:26 <cindyli> yes, you do, brendan_d
2016-01-05T15:36:47 <cindyli> that\'s the container for rendering ur new template
2016-01-05T15:37:40 <brendan_d> cindyli: ok so something like ".gpiic-fd-prefsEditor-panel-confirm"
2016-01-05T15:38:13 <cindyli> yes, brendan_d, i think you will need to add a new line in this file https://github.com/GPII/first-discovery/blob/master/src/html/firstDiscovery.html with the new selector
2016-01-05T15:40:24 <brendan_d> cindyli: right, i have this when i origianlly added the panel <section class="gpiic-fd-prefsEditor-panel-confirm gpiic-fd-prefsEditor-panel gpii-fd-prefsEditor-panel-confirm gpii-fd-main"></section>
2016-01-05T15:40:40 <cindyli> awesome
2016-01-05T15:42:49 <brendan_d> i have a template html file called confirmTemplate.html which the panel points to. i used the same code from the yesNo template to temp fill it
2016-01-05T15:43:39 <brendan_d> cindyli: so i have the panel pointing to this new template file, so i can go in here and chage the format/
2016-01-05T15:48:23 <brendan_d> cindyli: do you know of any documentation or help for actually coding this html file? for example there are paragraph classes and div classes like in the yesNo.html template that im not sure how to work with
2016-01-05T15:51:35 <brendan_d> like this code here: <p class="gpiic-fd-yesNo-instructions gpiic-fd-instructions gpii-fd-instructions"></p>
2016-01-05T15:53:02 <brendan_d> i realize that it is pointing to the "instructions" section in the message.json file, but simply changing the yesNo to confirmTemplate breaks the code
2016-01-05T15:55:29 * the-t-in-rtf has quit
2016-01-05T16:07:05 <Justin_o> brendan_d: when you say breaks the code, what sort of error are you getting?
2016-01-05T16:08:26 <brendan_d> when i change yesNo to confirmTemplate in that line of code, the instrusctions do not appear in the panel
2016-01-05T16:09:13 <cindyli> brendan_d: did you change the name of the panel component in schema.js?
2016-01-05T16:09:41 <cindyli> brendan_d: the classes defined in the template are mapped and used by the corresponding panel component, such as, the component gpii.firstDiscovery.panel.yesNo deals with yesNo template

2016-01-05T16:10:54 * alanharnum joined the channel
2016-01-05T16:10:58 <brendan_d> yea i changed the template option to confirmTemplate

2016-01-05T16:11:33 * alanharnum has quit
2016-01-05T16:11:54 <brendan_d> which is why im confused its still reading from yesNo
2016-01-05T16:14:00 <brendan_d> "type": "gpii.firstDiscovery.panel.confirm", "container": ".gpiic-fd-prefsEditor-panel-confirm", "template": "%templatePrefix/confirmTemplate.html",
2016-01-05T16:14:00 <brendan_d> "message": "%messagePrefix/confirm.json"
2016-01-05T16:14:51 * alanharn_ is now known as alanharnum
2016-01-05T16:15:22 <cindyli> brendan_d: is the confirmTemplate a copy of yesNo, or it has new content?
2016-01-05T16:16:05 <cindyli> also, have you created "gpii.firstDiscovery.panel.confirm"?
2016-01-05T16:16:54 * jhernand1z joined the channel
2016-01-05T16:17:14 <brendan_d> when i originally made the new doc, i copied the yesNo.html code to just fill it before i started making changes
2016-01-05T16:18:01 <cindyli> ok, is "gpii.firstDiscovery.panel.confirm" a copy of "gpii.firstDiscovery.panel.yesNo"?
2016-01-05T16:18:14 <clown> Justin_o: where or how did you find the AXLevelIndicator?

2016-01-05T16:20:47 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2016-01-05T16:21:52 <cindyli> brendan_d: the panel components are defined in panels.js
2016-01-05T16:22:23 <cindyli> brendan_d: u need to create "gpii.firstDiscovery.panel.confirm" in there too
2016-01-05T16:22:59 <brendan_d> ok hold on let me take a look
2016-01-05T16:23:05 <cindyli> "add" is more appropriate than "create"
2016-01-05T16:24:19 <cindyli> for now, you can make a copy of "gpii.firstDiscovery.panel.yesNo" and renamed it to "gpii.firstDiscovery.panel.confirm"
2016-01-05T16:26:49 <cindyli> brendan_d: sorry, "gpii.firstDiscovery.panel.yesNo" is used as a base component for all yes no panels, you should actually copy a component that uses "gpii.firstDiscovery.panel.yesNo" as a base grade, such as "gpii.firstDiscovery.panel.speakText"
