2016-08-02T16:10:52 <the-t-in-rtf> @Justin_o, any time before 17:30 CET is usually fine, but I have something specifically from 16:00-17:00 CET on Tuesdays
2016-08-02T16:11:07 <the-t-in-rtf> so 15:00-16:00 is a good time on Tuesday.
2016-08-02T16:12:25 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: will have to check with Dana, she might\'s a bit further back in time than us, so not sure if that will work from her and she might want to join.

2016-08-02T18:55:37 <the-t-in-rtf> I have a different meeting at that time, and they\'re not around until Monday morning for me to try and shift the time.
2016-08-02T18:55:43 <the-t-in-rtf> I don\'t usually have that one.
2016-08-02T18:56:07 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, later in the week makes it more likely I\'d have more to show, but I can do 15:00-16:00 CET on Monday.

2016-08-02T18:57:30 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: hmm.. we could try for the following week maybe.. it would give me time to check in on dana\'s schedule too...
2016-08-02T18:58:37 <the-t-in-rtf> That\'s fine.  I\'m super excited about the topic, but honestly, I have a million other things I\'m supposed to be doing.
2016-08-02T18:58:37 <the-t-in-rtf> :)
2016-08-02T18:59:01 <the-t-in-rtf> I\'ll keep my "prep for the meeting by writing the loader" reminder on even if we don\'t meet next week\xe2\x80\xa6 ;)
2016-08-02T19:00:20 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: we can still keep our meeting for next wednesday, but maybe move the larger group meeting to the following week.
2016-08-02T19:00:41 <the-t-in-rtf> Sounds good.
2016-08-02T19:00:49 <the-t-in-rtf> We\'ll do another pairing session.
2016-08-02T19:00:59 <the-t-in-rtf> If I finish before we meet, we\'ll review what I\'ve done and make notes for next steps
2016-08-02T19:01:04 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: cool :)

2016-08-02T14:14:06 <avtar> bens__: amatas is currently troubleshooting the issue
2016-08-02T14:15:03 <avtar> the jobs were cancelled because more than the expected amount were queued up and were spamming the ci list :/
2016-08-02T14:15:37 <avtar> that\'s why the unit tests in that case were skipped

2016-08-02T14:53:01 <the-t-in-rtf> OK, the eye of Sauron has passed me by, my part of the meeting is done.
2016-08-02T14:53:10 <the-t-in-rtf> still need help, @alanharnum?
2016-08-02T14:53:36 <alanharnum> the-t-in-rtf: yeah, real quick: am I correct that as currently implemented, gpii-binder only does binding for form elements?
2016-08-02T14:53:41 <the-t-in-rtf> @Justin_o, got and accepted the invite.
2016-08-02T14:54:06 <the-t-in-rtf> In theory it works with any element that fluid.value works with, as I have accidentally discovered when goofing up selectors.
2016-08-02T14:54:45 <alanharnum> i suppose then it\'s a question of what fluid.value works with :)
2016-08-02T14:54:49 <the-t-in-rtf> It is tested extensively with form values.
2016-08-02T14:54:55 <the-t-in-rtf> I have also used it with messages
2016-08-02T14:55:10 <the-t-in-rtf> for example, a view that has a message in its model and rerenders when the message changes.
2016-08-02T14:55:17 <the-t-in-rtf> in those cases it\'s just divs
2016-08-02T14:55:22 <the-t-in-rtf> (that hold the value)
2016-08-02T14:55:23 <alanharnum> yeah that was my question
2016-08-02T14:55:36 <the-t-in-rtf> actually, I don\'t think those use the binder.
2016-08-02T14:55:38 <the-t-in-rtf> hmmm.
2016-08-02T14:55:40 <alanharnum> it didn\'t seem to work for divs/spans when I was experimenting on Friday, but it\'s possible I wasn\'t using it correctly
2016-08-02T14:55:53 <the-t-in-rtf> it\'s all down to what fluid.value can work with, AFAIK
2016-08-02T14:56:01 <alanharnum> are those messages going through the handlebars template rendering, perhaps?
2016-08-02T14:57:12 <alanharnum> it seemed glancing at http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/ViewAPI.html#fluid-value-nodein-newvalue- that fluid.value is an extension / generalization of jQuery.val(), that is to say dealing with form element "value" attributes only
2016-08-02T14:57:20 <alanharnum> "If the supplied element is not an HTML radio button or checkbox, the implementation will defer to jQuery.val. "
2016-08-02T14:57:44 <alanharnum> so it\'s going to deal gracefully with checkable elements, but not do anything with a <div>, etc.
2016-08-02T14:57:49 <the-t-in-rtf> Yes, those are going through template rendering, and don\'t actually use the binder
2016-08-02T14:57:52 <alanharnum> ok cool
2016-08-02T14:58:08 <alanharnum> wanted to be sure i wasn\'t misunderstanding what the binder does/doesn\'t do
2016-08-02T14:58:09 <the-t-in-rtf> I just confirmed that it\'s fluid.value on both ends (reading and writing values that are in the DOM)
2016-08-02T14:59:08 <alanharnum> so gpii-handlebars do its own model binding or similar for non-form elements like messages, is that understanding correct?
2016-08-02T14:59:54 <the-t-in-rtf> yes.
2016-08-02T15:00:08 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, I do think that jQuery.val will work for non-form elements as well. http://api.jquery.com/val/
2016-08-02T15:00:51 <the-t-in-rtf> yup.
2016-08-02T15:01:00 <the-t-in-rtf> for example:  $("body").val("foo")
2016-08-02T15:01:50 <the-t-in-rtf> fluid.value($("body"))
2016-08-02T15:01:55 <the-t-in-rtf> returns "foo"
2016-08-02T15:02:30 <the-t-in-rtf> fluid.value($("body"), "bar") also works
2016-08-02T15:02:52 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, not sure what your use case is, but I don\'t see any reason why it shouldn\'t work.
2016-08-02T15:03:51 <the-t-in-rtf> That\'s based on actually trying it with jQuery and Fluid just now.
2016-08-02T15:04:16 <the-t-in-rtf> and by Fluid I mean the most recently published version available via npm.
2016-08-02T15:04:27 <the-t-in-rtf> "infusion": "2.0.0-dev.20160519T222603Z.754d2c6",
2016-08-02T15:04:41 <alanharnum> it\'s for building UIs for projects falling under this umbrella: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/(Floe)+Preference+Exploration+and+Self-Assessment
2016-08-02T15:05:01 <alanharnum> ok, i\'ll take a look at that
2016-08-02T15:05:19 <alanharnum> it may make sense to use the entire gpii-handlebars
2016-08-02T15:06:01 <the-t-in-rtf> I have worked hard to make it safe to use the client-side grades without using the server-side grades, hopefully you can just use the bits you want without needing gpii-express.
2016-08-02T15:06:06 <the-t-in-rtf> Try it out and of course let me know if there are questions.
2016-08-02T15:06:32 <alanharnum> will do - the binder looked really great when I was experimenting with it on Friday
2016-08-02T15:06:34 <the-t-in-rtf> (the server side grades include the express handlebars middleware, which only works with gpii-express).
2016-08-02T15:06:41 <the-t-in-rtf> Cool, glad it\'s getting used.
2016-08-02T15:07:07 <the-t-in-rtf> it\'ll probably be updated a bit this week to use the new webdriver test library and to address some small issues Antranig pointed out.
2016-08-02T15:07:17 <the-t-in-rtf> Most are housekeeping and should not affect anyone actually using the library
2016-08-02T15:07:38 <the-t-in-rtf> In fact, I think all of them are updating dependencies and tests, and not changing the code itself.
2016-08-02T15:07:59 <the-t-in-rtf> you can follow it here:  https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-1886
2016-08-02T15:08:17 <alanharnum> i did a little bit of experimentation with building a Knockout.js-type thing with it that could generate the bindings automagically from a template, which was pretty neat
2016-08-02T15:08:41 <alanharnum> thanks the-t-in-rtf!
2016-08-02T15:09:06 <the-t-in-rtf> Sure, if you have links to work that uses it, I look at other people\'s work just to compare approaches.
2016-08-02T15:09:20 <the-t-in-rtf> it\'s a good way to start thinking for the day.
2016-08-02T15:09:29 <the-t-in-rtf> I mean, if you have links, please share them.

2016-08-02T15:11:57 <alanharnum> it\'s pretty crude
2016-08-02T15:12:56 <the-t-in-rtf> Cool, thanks.
2016-08-02T15:13:09 <the-t-in-rtf> I need to tie up loose ends today, but I\'ll have it to read through over coffee tomorrow.
2016-08-02T15:13:10 <the-t-in-rtf> :)

2016-08-02T15:26:04 <the-t-in-rtf> Here\'s the branch we paired on today: https://github.com/the-t-in-rtf/fluid-sandbox/tree/GPII-1893
2016-08-02T15:26:17 <the-t-in-rtf> As you saw, it\'ll work with the reorderer at least.
2016-08-02T15:29:16 <the-t-in-rtf> @Justin_o, if you can put together a design crit time that doesn\'t conflict, I\'d love to follow up on that.
2016-08-02T15:29:31 <the-t-in-rtf> I could also probably skip my usual meeting with good cause\xe2\x80\xa6 ;)

2016-08-02T16:02:30 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf:  thanks for the link.
2016-08-02T16:03:10 <Justin_o> I\'m not sure if we can change the design crit times or not, sepidehshahi, jhung do you have thoughts on changing the time of the design crit for one week?
2016-08-02T16:03:36 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: would you like to meet now?
2016-08-02T16:03:43 <PaliwalSparsh> Justin_o: Surely Justin_o
2016-08-02T16:04:27 <sepidehshahi> jhung: and Justin_o I think if we send out the email early enough, there should be no problem changing the design crit time for one week. What time are you thinking of?
2016-08-02T16:04:38 <PaliwalSparsh> i was abt to type that only, we should skype.
2016-08-02T16:04:55 <jhung> Justin_o: we don\'t have to move the design crit, maybe just schedule another meeting? Sort of what we did for PhET a few days ago?
2016-08-02T16:05:06 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: what time would work better for you?
