b'2016-07-01T00:00:07 <Bosmon> Not yet
2016-07-01T00:00:10 <colinclark> ok
2016-07-01T00:00:13 <gtirloni> colinclark, i guess it\'s prudent to let the mini cool down, yes. that shouldn\'t be a problem since dev\'s can run vagrant on their machines (i.e. the mini won\'t be a blocker)
2016-07-01T00:00:37 <colinclark> when you do get it to provision, i\'m curious to hear what happens when you type "grunt test" in your linux directory
2016-07-01T00:01:02 <colinclark> Bosmon: ^
2016-07-01T00:01:15 <Bosmon> colinclark - ok
2016-07-01T00:01:17 <Bosmon> Starting again now
2016-07-01T00:03:49 <colinclark> gtirloni: ok, so i\'m just mulling this over
2016-07-01T00:03:56 <colinclark> I\'d really love to merge these PRs
2016-07-01T00:04:10 <colinclark> since they\'re interdependent and much-needed
2016-07-01T00:04:18 <colinclark> but I don\'t want to overheat the mini
2016-07-01T00:04:24 * gabrielmancini joined the channel
2016-07-01T00:04:27 <colinclark> i\'m tempted to turn off the CI webhook and merge them tomorrow
2016-07-01T00:04:29 <gtirloni> i wouldn\'t worry about overheating it
2016-07-01T00:04:54 <colinclark> ok
2016-07-01T00:04:55 <gtirloni> i mean, things will either work, fail because of code or have weird errors because it\'s overheated
2016-07-01T00:05:00 <colinclark> right
2016-07-01T00:05:01 <colinclark> ok
2016-07-01T00:05:09 <colinclark> I\'m not doing anything at 8 pm right before a long weekend
2016-07-01T00:05:17 <colinclark> but I think on Saturday I will go ahead and merge everything
2016-07-01T00:05:19 <gtirloni> agreed 100%
2016-07-01T00:05:32 <Bosmon> colinclark - ok, for some reason provisioning the linux repo appears to work this time
2016-07-01T00:06:21 <colinclark> Bosmon: that\'s great!
2016-07-01T00:06:37 <colinclark> what\'ll happen when you type "grunt tests"
2016-07-01T00:06:41 <colinclark> gtirloni: got it
2016-07-01T00:06:44 <colinclark> avtar: you\'re cool with this?
2016-07-01T00:06:47 <Bosmon> We\'ll see
2016-07-01T00:06:51 <Bosmon> Still a long way to go before that point
2016-07-01T00:07:06 <avtar> colinclark: sounds good
2016-07-01T00:07:38 <gtirloni> Bosmon, i\'ll be around tomorrow if you want to have a shared desktop session where i look into any issues you might be having with vagrant
2016-07-01T00:07:51 <Bosmon> I\'m not sure you\'d enjoy seeing my desktop :)
2016-07-01T00:08:07 <gtirloni> you can share just the command prompt window so i\'m not traumatized :P
2016-07-01T00:08:13 <Bosmon> hahahaha
2016-07-01T00:08:47 <gtirloni> anyway, i\'ll be around so just let me know. we can do it over chat too. i\'m logging off for the day now
2016-07-01T00:08:55 <Bosmon> ok, thanks
2016-07-01T00:08:58 <Bosmon> I should be around a bit
2016-07-01T00:09:05 <gtirloni> ok, see you
2016-07-01T00:09:11 <colinclark> Bosmon: I\'m goign to hit the road too
2016-07-01T00:09:19 <Bosmon> IF THERE WERE NO GIOVANNI TIRLONI
2016-07-01T00:09:22 <colinclark> and avtar looks like he\'s already closed his laptop lid

2016-07-01T11:48:52 <DinukaDeSilva> Hi all. how about having a generic component for generating a demo of a code
2016-07-01T11:48:55 <DinukaDeSilva> http://dinukadesilva.github.io/music-ctrls/demo/piano.html
2016-07-01T11:49:06 <DinukaDeSilva> same as which is in this page
2016-07-01T11:49:32 <DinukaDeSilva> so, that we can integrate it to our documentation pages as well
2016-07-01T11:50:38 <DinukaDeSilva> which also makes easier to run an example without setting up things separately
2016-07-01T11:52:48 <DinukaDeSilva> also I think, having a live example which can be edited and re-run makes the user easier to understand a code than understanding textual descriptions
2016-07-01T11:53:07 <DinukaDeSilva> let me know your thoughts
