2016-04-05T20:03:18 <cindyli> sgithens: i was talking to Justin_o, alanharnum, gtirloni about the email you sent to the arch list regarding whether http://preferences.gpii.net/ is still configured for adding preferences. here are their answers:
2016-04-05T20:03:36 <cindyli> from gtirloni
2016-04-05T20:03:36 <cindyli> "yeah, i saw it. we don\'t have oauth enabled in those instances. it\'s a question we wanted to ask in the arch meeting tomorrow"
2016-04-05T20:03:47 <sgithens> cindyli: cool
2016-04-05T20:03:51 <cindyli> from alanharnum: "should be https://flowmanager.gpii.net I think"
2016-04-05T20:03:53 <sgithens> the bug is not with me then
2016-04-05T20:04:22 <sgithens> so I should give it a go with flowmanager.gpii.net?
2016-04-05T20:04:42 <sgithens> let me try it out quick
2016-04-05T20:05:04 <cindyli> sgithens: you could give it a try. we will talk about it in tomorrow\'s arch meeting anyway
2016-04-05T20:06:33 * yzen has quit
2016-04-05T20:07:33 <sgithens> cindyli: Trying it now quick
2016-04-05T20:07:40 <cindyli> thanks, sgithens
2016-04-05T20:11:02 <sgithens> cindyli: Would the port for that be 443 then I assume?
2016-04-05T20:11:38 <cindyli> alanharnum: ^ do you know the port configured for https://flowmanager.gpii.net
2016-04-05T20:11:50 * jhung has quit
2016-04-05T20:12:09 <alanharnum> it\'s default ports for the front-facing stuff, yeah
2016-04-05T20:13:20 <sgithens> so, for the Oauth connections and stuff from a first-discovery-tool it would be 443 or 80?
2016-04-05T20:13:45 <sgithens> I realize the answer should be obvious, but I want to expllicity confirm what you\xe2\x80\x99d expect it to be
2016-04-05T20:15:35 <cindyli> sgithens: do you mean from first-discovery-server to flow manager? or first discovery tool to first discovery server?
2016-04-05T20:15:53 <sgithens> first-discovery-server to the flow manager
2016-04-05T20:15:57 * jhung joined the channel
2016-04-05T20:16:33 <sgithens> https://gist.github.com/sgithens/edbbcd299c2d9f8cf8593608b06fddb9
2016-04-05T20:16:43 <sgithens> I tried 443 first
2016-04-05T20:17:01 <sgithens> I just get: 13:14:57.171:  {
2016-04-05T20:17:02 <sgithens> "code": "ECONNREFUSED",

2016-04-05T20:17:09 <sgithens> }
2016-04-05T20:17:53 <sgithens> maybe the actual secrets I need to use are different for a real server...
2016-04-05T20:18:05 <cindyli> cool. thanks for sharing that. Justin_o is right now on a call, he would know better of that configuration
2016-04-05T20:18:24 <Justin_o> cindyli: what was that for?
2016-04-05T20:18:25 <alanharnum> sgithens: have you seen https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/First+Discovery+Server+Demo?
2016-04-05T20:18:42 <cindyli> Justin_o: to config FD server to connect to the remote flow manager
2016-04-05T20:18:44 <alanharnum> though that may not be helpful
2016-04-05T20:18:57 <alanharnum> it\'s somewhat old
2016-04-05T20:19:00 <cindyli> we are trying to figure out if https://flowmanager.gpii.net still can be used
2016-04-05T20:19:14 <alanharnum> let me look at exactly what\'s being built for flowmanager.gpii.net
2016-04-05T20:19:27 <Blagoj> Is it strange that I cannot reproduce the original demos when I run them on local server at my PC? I got some of the functionalities and some of the designs, the console says no errors :(
2016-04-05T20:19:52 <alanharnum> those are from the Review 4 demo & were configured pretty specifically for that
2016-04-05T20:20:08 <cindyli> hey, this demo is still live. i did get a token at the end - http://first-discovery.floeproject.org/demos/prefsServerIntegration/
2016-04-05T20:20:17 <cindyli> so, it must be connecting to a remote flow manager
2016-04-05T20:20:44 <sgithens> cool
2016-04-05T20:20:45 <sgithens> I guess the difference is that I need to host the fdserver because I want to configure a custom set of panels for the fdtool
2016-04-05T20:20:46 <alanharnum> yeah, it\'s a closed loop - not sure it\'s useful to sgithens purposes
2016-04-05T20:20:48 <cindyli> if alanharnum can look at the FD server configuration for running this demo, then we are good to go
2016-04-05T20:20:57 <Justin_o> Blagoj: are you running it through a web server?
2016-04-05T20:21:13 <alanharnum> I also don\'t know a huge amount about the code itself, just about how to build Docker containers that will ultimately talk to each other :)
2016-04-05T20:21:23 <cindyli> ok
2016-04-05T20:21:32 <Blagoj> Justin_o: through wamp
2016-04-05T20:22:06 <Justin_o> cindyli, sgithens, alanharnum: i\'m guess the the flow manger instance you mentioned doesn\'t have all the security workflow running in it.
2016-04-05T20:22:15 <gtirloni> sgithens: are you getting connection refused while trying to access "flowmanager.gpii.net" on port 443 using https protocol, is that it?
2016-04-05T20:22:20 <Justin_o> the one for the FD demo is a separate instance, a closed loop as alanharnum says.
2016-04-05T20:22:32 <cindyli> ok, i see
2016-04-05T20:22:41 <Blagoj> Here is what I get when I run the uiOptions demo
2016-04-05T20:22:44 <Blagoj> https://i.gyazo.com/26dea4c2aa0150de77799732fbb3a7e8.png
2016-04-05T20:23:17 <Justin_o> Blagoj: that\'s unexpected
2016-04-05T20:23:38 <Justin_o> Blagoj: what is the URL you are using?
2016-04-05T20:23:49 <cindyli> and which browser, Blagoj
2016-04-05T20:24:33 <Blagoj> Browser: Chrome, Url: http://localhost/infusion-master/demos/uiOptions/index.html, I\'ve copied the infusion-master to www directory from the wamp server
2016-04-05T20:25:01 <gtirloni> sgithens: just saw the gist you pasted, so you\'re connecting to localhost right. i don\'t know which port you\'ve got flowmanager running on, but it should be the same
2016-04-05T20:25:02 <Blagoj> it\'s separate from the github repo, but I thought I could try this one for testing
2016-04-05T20:25:51 <gtirloni> sgithens: i don\'t think we have any oauth support in the instances we\'re running live (preferences.gpii.net and flowmanager.gpii.net), so using them for oauth use cases probably won\'t work
2016-04-05T20:26:07 <Justin_o> Blagoj: i think that should be okay... super weird could be something to do with the configuration of your web server i guess
2016-04-05T20:26:43 <Justin_o> can you double check the console to make sure there\'s no errors and maybe also check the network tab in the dev tools to make sure all the CSS, JS, and HTML are coming through
2016-04-05T20:27:23 <sgithens> gtirloni: Yeah, it works ok using my local GPII.  I just have the local one commented out and am trying to use the hosted one: https://gist.github.com/sgithens/edbbcd299c2d9f8cf8593608b06fddb9#file-config-js-L11-L12
2016-04-05T20:28:48 <gtirloni> sgithens: got it, 443 should work (if it can talk HTTPS). if you\'re getting conn refused, i\'d try access https://flowmanager.gpii.net/login to test it through a browser.. but it\'s odd
2016-04-05T20:29:18 <sgithens> oh
2016-04-05T20:29:23 <sgithens> yeah I see the login
2016-04-05T20:29:41 <sgithens> I\xe2\x80\x99m guess I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure how you actually get a username and password...

2016-04-05T20:30:09 <sgithens> honestly, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what even happesn when the fdtool gets a generated token since you never actually use a username/password
2016-04-05T20:31:32 <Blagoj> Justin_o: Thanks for the answer, the network tab is okay, from the console, I get just a warning:
2016-04-05T20:31:32 <Blagoj> chrome-extension://nocpfkkbaekckhcoekockfbidpcjgkbd/jquery2.js:3 Synchronous XMLHttpRequest on the main thread is deprecated because of its detrimental effects to the end user\'s experience. For more help, check https://xhr.spec.whatwg.org/.
2016-04-05T20:31:51 <gtirloni> sgithens: that just caused a kernel panic in my brain because i\'m not sure how that works either.. haven\'t used the fdtool extensively here
2016-04-05T20:32:27 <sgithens> :)

2016-04-05T20:35:24 <Justin_o> Blagoj: intersting. i don\'t think there is a synchronous ajax call in that file.. perhaps it is something with the way WAMP is configured... i\'m also not using a Windows machine so could be something specific to that
2016-04-05T20:37:07 <Justin_o> Blagoj: oh looking at your error again, it looks like it\'s coming from a chrome extension you\'re running

2016-04-05T20:40:48 <Justin_o> Blagoj: good luck

2016-04-05T16:51:15 <cindyli> "the application registration to get the client id and client secret" is not done yet

2016-04-05T16:52:12 <Katy> cindyli. Are there a list of authorization servers (facebook, twitter, etc)  GPII is planning on using

2016-04-05T16:53:45 <Blagoj> Justin_o: I\'ve just created new pull request. I think I will close and re-open the previous two that are not merged yet
2016-04-05T16:54:27 * PaliwalSparsh1 has quit
2016-04-05T16:54:46 <Justin_o> Blagoj: okay, just make sure to leave  comment on the one you close with a link to the new one. That way we can better keep track of comments and etc.
2016-04-05T16:55:47 <Blagoj> Justin_o: Thanks, I will do that too. I think I am on the right track now :D
2016-04-05T16:56:11 <cindyli> Justin_o, alanharnum, gtirloni, did you see gloob\'s email to the arch list about whether http://preferences.gpii.net/ is still configured for adding preferences? I rmb we did have a live remote flow manager to handle this request. is it still alive?
2016-04-05T16:56:23 <cindyli> gloob\'s email - http://preferences.gpii.net/
2016-04-05T16:56:25 <Justin_o> Blagoj: cool, thanks
2016-04-05T16:56:41 <cindyli> sorry, wrong link. Justin_o, alanharnum, gtirloni, gloob\'s email - http://lists.gpii.net/pipermail/architecture/2016-April/004047.html
2016-04-05T16:56:56 <gtirloni> cindyli: yeah, i saw it. we don\'t have oauth enabled in those instances. it\'s a question we wanted to ask in the arch meeting tomorrow
2016-04-05T16:57:04 <gloob> it was from steven cindyli :-)
2016-04-05T16:57:23 <cindyli> sorry, gloob, u r not steven?
2016-04-05T16:57:34 <cindyli> might be a stupid question :)
2016-04-05T16:57:37 <gloob> haha, no

2016-04-05T16:58:01 <gloob> no problem
2016-04-05T16:58:03 <gloob> all is fine
2016-04-05T16:58:05 <gloob> all is good
2016-04-05T16:58:13 <cindyli> cool. good to know, thanks, gloob
2016-04-05T17:01:04 * lliskovoi has quit
2016-04-05T17:01:49 <alanharnum> cindyli: should be https://flowmanager.gpii.net I think
2016-04-05T17:02:10 <alanharnum> IIRC you have to do your integration (for something like the FDS) through that rather than hitting preferences server directly, correct?

2016-04-05T17:07:01 <jhung> alanharnum: does the custom build of infusion for qi dashboard demo include UIO?
2016-04-05T17:09:50 <alanharnum> jhung: no - it\'s got the same build as the chartAuthoring library, which doesn\'t have UIO
2016-04-05T17:12:17 <jhung> ok. just curious. If there\'s time I\'d like to consider adding UIO into the demo, but it would add additional time for testing and theming which we may not have time for.

2016-04-05T17:15:47 <alanharnum> jhung: I think it would be great if we could do that - i\'ve never implemented UIO, so I\'m not sure how long it takes
2016-04-05T17:16:25 <alanharnum> if you want to use a full build of Infusion rather than custom one for your fork to assess the difficulty of that, i\'d go right ahead
2016-04-05T17:17:15 <jhung> alanharnum: will do.
2016-04-05T17:22:15 <jhung> alanharnum: I\'ve pushed styling changes to my branch. You can check it out and let me know if there are any changes. I\'m going to switch gears onto PhET now and back onto this later (and maybe look into UIO).

2016-04-05T17:55:27 <colinclark> I\'m free from 2-4 pm
2016-04-05T17:55:33 <alanharnum> how about 3:00?
2016-04-05T17:55:37 <colinclark> works great for me
2016-04-05T17:55:42 <avtar> alanharnum: sounds good
2016-04-05T17:56:23 <michelled> works for me too
2016-04-05T17:56:49 <jhung> colinclark: I\'m going into a phet meeting in 4 minutes.
2016-04-05T17:57:44 <colinclark> oh yes!
2016-04-05T17:57:51 <colinclark> when will you be free?
2016-04-05T17:58:53 <jhung> I\'m going to try to leave early. Going to try for 2:30p colinclark.
2016-04-05T17:59:37 <colinclark> ok, so it sounds like we\'ll need to fill you in later?
2016-04-05T18:00:13 <jhung> ok. sounds fine. Thanks
2016-04-05T18:01:29 <jhung> colinclark,alanharnum, avtar - so are we meeting at 3p?
2016-04-05T18:01:34 <colinclark> yup
2016-04-05T18:01:39 <colinclark> I\'ve put it in the fluid-work calendar
2016-04-05T18:01:44 <colinclark> let\'s meet in fluid-standup
2016-04-05T18:01:59 <jhung> Ok. That should be fine. I\'ll leave the PhET meeting early and can join.
2016-04-05T18:02:04 <jhung> Cool.
2016-04-05T18:02:10 <colinclark> ok--only if it\'s convenient, jhung
2016-04-05T18:02:15 <colinclark> if the PhET meeting is awesome, stay there :)
2016-04-05T18:02:26 <jhung> Will do.

2016-04-05T18:15:03 <alanharnum> i\'ll show to others at the update meeting
2016-04-05T18:15:11 <jhung> ok great.
2016-04-05T18:18:25 <jhung> alanharnum: left on my todo is to try adding UIO and get contrast theming working. Then if there\'s time I\'d like to spice up the demo by adding some css transitions when moving between desktop to mobile so it matches the fluidity of chart animations.

2016-04-05T19:00:50 <colinclark> our meeting is going late
2016-04-05T19:00:55 <avtar> ok
2016-04-05T19:00:58 <colinclark> we\'re just entering our third hour
2016-04-05T19:01:10 <colinclark> and it\'s useful enough that I don\'t want to drop off
2016-04-05T19:01:14 <colinclark> so can we hold off a bit?
2016-04-05T19:01:18 <alanharnum> 3:30 or 4:00 is fine with me
2016-04-05T19:01:19 <colinclark> but we\'ll be in fluid_standup
2016-04-05T19:01:26 <colinclark> I have a very important 4 pm meeting
2016-04-05T19:01:32 <colinclark> so it\'ll have to be 3:30 or before :)
2016-04-05T19:02:12 <colinclark> I\'m really sorry about the unpredictability
2016-04-05T19:02:15 <colinclark> it\'s been one of those days
2016-04-05T19:02:49 <alanharnum> ok, let\'s target 3:30

2016-04-05T14:13:48 <Justin_o> alanharnum: i see there is a suggestion for you to lead a community meeting on "introduction to programming" would you be interested in doing that on April 27th or May 4th?
2016-04-05T14:15:12 <alanharnum> Justin_o: I could do it for May 4
2016-04-05T14:15:50 <Justin_o> alanharnum: great thanks, i\'ll put you down for that
2016-04-05T14:15:55 <PaliwalSparsh> Justin_o I didn\'t get your comment "the outline should be added on hover and focus" , please help me with it.
2016-04-05T14:15:56 <PaliwalSparsh> Here .fl-pager-currentPage has no outline this was to make sure that the outlines from the adjacent page link don\'t touch the current page outlines on hover
2016-04-05T14:15:56 <PaliwalSparsh> Also the current-page:hover has outline to make sure that outline is there when we hover on the selected page. So outline is on hover f"ocus" I am not able to get it here what it refers to.
2016-04-05T14:16:57 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: for the current page link i\'m getting the outline when the mouse hovers, but not what i use the keyboard to put focus on it.
2016-04-05T14:18:10 <PaliwalSparsh> Justin_o ok i\'ll have a look at it. Thanks
2016-04-05T14:18:26 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: thanks
2016-04-05T14:18:39 <Justin_o> let me know if you have more questions..
2016-04-05T14:18:56 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: also, in regards to removing the hover/focus styling from the disabled prev/next
2016-04-05T14:19:33 <Justin_o> that makes sense, but they are still focusable, which makes it confusing, as you don\'t know where you are when using only the keyboard

2016-04-05T14:20:34 <PaliwalSparsh> Justin_o my bad I didnt know about the keyboard focus thing I will fix both of them.
2016-04-05T14:21:31 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: i think for the disabled prev/next links they should probably be removed from the tab order when they are disabled.. this will require changes to the javascript code
2016-04-05T14:22:01 <Justin_o> danayo: do you agree that the prev and next buttons should not be in the tab order when they are disabled. for the pager component.
2016-04-05T14:23:44 <PaliwalSparsh> Justin_o we can do it, then I will wait for danayo to make the change.
2016-04-05T14:24:06 <PaliwalSparsh> **then I will wait for danayo\'s reply to make the change
2016-04-05T14:25:17 <danayo> Justin_o PaliwalSparsh: they are disabled when you are on first or last page, right?
2016-04-05T14:25:58 <PaliwalSparsh> @danayo yes disabled and grey in color as we discussed earlier
2016-04-05T14:27:19 <danayo> yes I agree they should not be in the tab order Justin_o PaliwalSparsh
2016-04-05T14:27:29 <Justin_o> Bosmon: It\'s been suggested that you lead a couple of community meetings for the "Case Studies of User Creativity in Computing" for the specific topics of "Self" and "Logo" would you be able to do one of those for the April 27th community meeting?
2016-04-05T14:28:05 <Bosmon2> Justin_o - sure
2016-04-05T14:28:28 <Justin_o> Bosmon2: thanks... do you have a preference for which one you\'ll talk about?
2016-04-05T14:28:36 <Bosmon2> I imagine I\'ll talk about Logo
2016-04-05T14:28:46 <Bosmon2> I don\'t know much more about Self than one can grasp from the "Self video"
2016-04-05T14:28:57 <PaliwalSparsh> @danayo So we will completely remove them right.
2016-04-05T14:29:32 <Justin_o> Bosmon2: okay thanks... i\'ll put you down for "Logo" on April 27th
2016-04-05T14:29:48 * Bosmon2 is now known as Bosmon
2016-04-05T14:29:49 <Justin_o> Bosmon2: what\'s the "Self Video" is it something we could/should watch at a  community meeting?
2016-04-05T14:29:56 <Bosmon> Sure, we could
2016-04-05T14:30:03 <Bosmon> I think it\'s about 20 mins long?
2016-04-05T14:30:21 <PaliwalSparsh> @danayo or when person is on first link previous disappears and when goes to second it appears again. Similar for next.
2016-04-05T14:30:40 <Justin_o> Bosmon: cool, do you have a link to that?
2016-04-05T14:31:58 <Bosmon> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox5P7QyL774
2016-04-05T14:32:21 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks :)
2016-04-05T14:32:28 <Bosmon> It\'s pretty funny
2016-04-05T14:32:39 <Bosmon> We watched it at the GPII Hackathon in Copenhagen last year
2016-04-05T14:35:51 <Justin_o> Bosmon: :) should be fun to watch. Hopefully the vidyo conferencing will be able to stream it okay, or we\'ll have to let the remote participants watch it themselves and just agree on a time to sync back up
2016-04-05T14:39:25 <colinclark> It\'s a pretty interesting video, Justin_o
2016-04-05T14:40:07 <alanharnum> hey folks - I\'ve sent an email to the fluid-work list asking for opinions about what I should do for an "Introduction to Programming" community meeting (http://lists.idrc.ocad.ca/pipermail/fluid-work/2016-April/009921.html) - I\'d appreciate any feedback
2016-04-05T14:40:35 <alanharnum> so that the meeting is not just everyone watching me program live or something like that :)

2016-04-05T14:46:23 <colinclark> Justin_o: Do we know if there\'s a version of the Self video with audio descriptions?
2016-04-05T14:46:48 <Justin_o> colinclark: i\'m not sure
2016-04-05T14:47:33 <colinclark> I suppose we can stop the video at points and describe the key action
2016-04-05T14:49:28 <michelled> danayo, Justin_o, colinclark: it looks like the APCP security meeting is regularly scheduled on top of our PGA check in
2016-04-05T14:49:32 <michelled> do we want to check in today?
2016-04-05T14:50:09 <Justin_o> michelled: was there anything interesting from the meeting yesterday?
2016-04-05T14:50:10 <colinclark> I\'d really like to, yes
2016-04-05T14:50:37 <Justin_o> colinclark: i\'ll take a quick look to see if i can find a version of the video with audio descriptions.. i haven\'t watched it before so i\'m not sure what the content is like
