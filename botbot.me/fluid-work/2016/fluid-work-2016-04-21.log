2016-04-21T14:00:21 <dins> I feel like it's nice to have it integrated into pull requests
2016-04-21T14:00:52 <dins> is there any similar thing like that have implemented in infusion
2016-04-21T14:02:07 <avtar> dins: there is a jenkins instance that runs tests and generates builds but after merges take place
2016-04-21T14:02:41 <dins> avtar: has it integrated into pull requests
2016-04-21T14:03:31 <dins> I mean, is there anyway I can see the results of test cases
2016-04-21T14:03:58 <dins> through that jenkins instance
2016-04-21T14:06:32 <avtar> dins: https://ci.fluidproject.org/job/fluid-infusion/
2016-04-21T14:07:22 <avtar> the test runs aren't triggered for pull requests at the moment, just merges
2016-04-21T14:08:33 <dins> yeah...  Thanks for sharing avtar
2016-04-21T14:09:16 <dins> it's nice to have integrated even into pull requests too
2016-04-21T14:09:20 <avtar> it runs the tests this way: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/README.md#run-tests-using-browsers-installed-in-a-vm
2016-04-21T14:09:54 <avtar> which you can use on your computer to view test results

2016-04-21T15:43:25 <jhung> alanharnum: regarding UIO being ahead of it's time\xe2\x80\xa6 I'm starting to use Foundation 6 and it seems they've made some significant improvements to their CSS, including using rems instead of ems. So UIO should work even better now with Foundation.
2016-04-21T15:43:45 <alanharnum> Foundation = Zurb Foundation?
2016-04-21T15:43:55 * the-t-in-rtf has quit

2016-04-21T15:44:06 <alanharnum> cool
2016-04-21T15:44:10 <alanharnum> i hadn't realized we used Zurb for us
2016-04-21T15:44:15 * alanharnum really likes Zurb.
2016-04-21T15:45:59 <jhung> alanharnum: we use Foundation in many of our websites and a few of our demos. However we're using Foundation 5 for those. We have yet to use Foundation 6 for anything yet. I've been using F6 for a personal project and it's been good.
