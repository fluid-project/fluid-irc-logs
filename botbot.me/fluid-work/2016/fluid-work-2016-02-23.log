b'2016-02-23T17:37:44 <bens01> Justin_o, the root issue seems to be on infusion-custom.js:16508. The component.id is not in instatiator.idToShadow, thus returning null up the stack

2016-02-23T19:04:27 <alanharnum> i\'m getting that "failed to establish connection with router (error 1003)" problem

2016-02-23T19:22:40 <alanharnum> gtirloni: workaround seems to be to log in from another machine and then log out
2016-02-23T19:22:49 <alanharnum> it might be OK to just sign out, but I didn\'t specifically try that
2016-02-23T19:24:24 <gtirloni> every time i log in from my phone, the next time i try to login from my laptop, it takes a while, times out and i have to login again... maybe it\'s similar? (the same happens if i was logged in through the laptop and next try to login from the phone)

2016-02-23T20:05:49 <alanharnum> gtirloni: i think they\'re probably connected yeah - it\'s making sure you can\'t be logged in on two machines under the same account, I believe
2016-02-23T20:06:29 <alanharnum> if you\'re logged into Vidyo on computer #1 and then log in from computer #2, it boots you from computer #1
2016-02-23T20:06:57 <alanharnum> i suspect what might be happening is a scenario where it boots you from computer #1, but the client doesn\'t properly log you out client-side
2016-02-23T20:07:10 <alanharnum> so you appear to be successfully logged in, but when you try to connect you get blocked
2016-02-23T20:50:01 <bens01> Justin_o, any plans to be in the first-discovery.mybluemix.net site tonight, i\'d like to have some downtime tonight to deploy bug fixes that are ready and increase fd-server logging. I\'d like to take 7 PM EST to 12 AM EST, but thats very flexible
2016-02-23T20:50:28 <Justin_o> bens01: thanks for the heads up.. i shouldn\'t be on at that time
2016-02-23T20:50:51 <bens01> Justin_o, thx!
2016-02-23T20:51:27 <Justin_o> bens01: i\'m still trying to look into the issue with the reset short cut
2016-02-23T20:51:36 <Justin_o> been a bit delayed by some meetings though..
2016-02-23T20:54:34 <bens01> Justin_o, thanks, i am really interested in what your thoughts are on it.. the keyboardInput component has a lifecycleStatus of destroyed.. so my first thought is that since its destroyed we shouldn\'t be attempting to include it in the model change transaction.. but i\'m at the limit of my infusion knowledge there
2016-02-23T20:54:59 <bens01> or that it is destroyed but should have been kept alive..

2016-02-23T21:34:35 <Justin_o> not really sure what\'s happened, the version that we had did work http://build.fluidproject.org/first-discovery/demos/prefsServerIntegration/
2016-02-23T21:34:40 * clown joined the channel
2016-02-23T21:34:56 <Justin_o> so there must have been some change along the way that has caused something to break, but not sure what it is
2016-02-23T21:35:46 <Justin_o> bens01: I can\'t remember, did you guys upgrade infusion at all?
2016-02-23T21:38:54 * yzen_ joined the channel
2016-02-23T21:41:23 <bens01> Justin_o, i\'ll have to check in the repo history. i did checkout some commits at different points in the past few months and in some of them there is a bug we introduced on the confirm panel that breaks reset, then in others there is one related to keyboardInput
2016-02-23T21:42:27 <bens01> Justin_o, is it odd to you that the keyboardInput component is lifecycleStatus: destroyed
2016-02-23T21:43:23 <Justin_o> bens01: well yes, it tends to be an issue when you try to access a destroyed component
2016-02-23T21:43:50 <Justin_o> but that\'s not to say that the component shouldn\'t be destroyed.. there may be something that is just happening at the wrong time now, if you know what i mean
2016-02-23T21:45:19 <bens01> Justin_o, yes i follow. is there a trace functionality in infusion for debugging component creation/destroy and other lifecycle events?
2016-02-23T21:45:48 <bens01> Justin_o, such as this I suppose: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Debugging+in+Fluid+Infusion
2016-02-23T21:46:45 * jhung has quit
2016-02-23T21:53:01 <Justin_o> bens01: you could take a look at this http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/CoreAPI.html#logging-and-error-handling
2016-02-23T21:53:26 <Justin_o> bens01: you could change the log level with http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/CoreAPI.html#fluid-setlogging-loglevel-
2016-02-23T21:53:39 <Justin_o> to one of the values from this table http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/CoreAPI.html#fluid-loglevel
2016-02-23T21:53:44 <Justin_o> warning, you may get a lot of logs
2016-02-23T21:54:39 <bens01> thank you

2016-02-23T16:02:22 <Bosmon> Hi there cindyli - I\'ve finally merged in your pull request https://github.com/amb26/universal/pull/2/
2016-02-23T16:02:26 <Bosmon> Sorry it took me so long to get to it
2016-02-23T16:02:37 <cindyli> yay! thanks, Bosmon
2016-02-23T16:02:42 <Bosmon> DO you think you could now close and regenerate your https://github.com/amb26/universal/pull/3 against the current of my GPII-1318 branch?
2016-02-23T16:02:46 <Bosmon> That will make it much easier to review
2016-02-23T16:02:48 <cindyli> exactly, Bosmon
2016-02-23T16:03:10 <cindyli> i will bring the pull #3 up to date with your merged branch and let you know. doing it now
2016-02-23T16:04:35 <bens01> Justin_o, can you attempt to replicate it now? I am watching logs
2016-02-23T16:06:42 <Justin_o> bens01: sure... I just cleared my browser history and cache and loaded up the electron version of the tool
2016-02-23T16:07:03 <cindyli> done, Bosmon, https://github.com/amb26/universal/pull/3 is ready for review
2016-02-23T16:07:20 <Justin_o> bens01: i turned off the self voicing and proceeded to the end of the tool.
2016-02-23T16:07:29 <Justin_o> i got the 502 error
2016-02-23T16:07:57 <bens01> Justin_o, and if you reload from there?
2016-02-23T16:08:30 <Bosmon> cindyli - how did you do that?

2016-02-23T16:09:01 <bens01> Justin_o, just saw set with id 932be06570ad8f1e6f35b6f7a4388c68 get created in server
2016-02-23T16:09:07 <cindyli> Bosmon: i fetched ur GPII-1318 branch and merged into my 1521 branch, that\'s all i did
2016-02-23T16:09:16 <Bosmon> cindyli - very strange
2016-02-23T16:09:25 <Bosmon> They must have changed the behaviour in github
2016-02-23T16:09:33 <Bosmon> It always used to stay fossilized at the original target branch state
2016-02-23T16:09:38 <Justin_o> bens01: yes, that is the one that is written to the USB after reloading the page
2016-02-23T16:10:16 <bens01> Justin_o, the first attempt didn\'t hit the flowmanager or preferences server.. the second attempt did
2016-02-23T16:10:39 <Justin_o> bens01: it might be failing in the FD server then
2016-02-23T16:10:41 <bens01> Justin_o, i\'m going to look at logging some additional info in the first discovery server to see if we can get more details
2016-02-23T16:10:48 <Justin_o> thanks :)
2016-02-23T16:11:26 <cindyli> nah, Bosmon, from what i noticed from very beginning with github, the pull is always updated up to date based on the latest branch state
2016-02-23T16:11:41 <Bosmon> Ah
2016-02-23T16:11:52 <Bosmon> I guess it is changes in the target branch it doesn\'t track
2016-02-23T16:11:59 <bens01> Justin_o, could you also try to replicate from your Mac when you get a chance?
2016-02-23T16:12:00 <Bosmon> But if the pull request branch is updated, it will update both
2016-02-23T16:12:16 <cindyli> ah, ok
2016-02-23T16:15:59 <Justin_o> bens01: seems to work from my mac

The systems need to be more open, he says, so professors can understand and trust them without having to get an advanced degree in computer science.\'
2016-02-23T16:19:31 <alanharnum> love that last sentence
2016-02-23T16:20:26 <Justin_o> bens01: now i\'m getting it working in the Windows VM as well without the page reload...
2016-02-23T16:22:07 <Justin_o> bens01: not sure what happened, but it seems to be working now
2016-02-23T16:22:53 <bens01> Justin_o, both zach and I have intermittently replicated, but its working for us now too
2016-02-23T16:23:29 <bens01> if you get a failure again could you copy the request as curl from chrome\'s network tab?
2016-02-23T16:23:30 <Justin_o> bens01: strange... some sort of load or concurrency issue maybe?
2016-02-23T16:25:48 <bens01> Justin_o, an odd one for sure. I\'m going to add some logging to the fd-server to gather more info
2016-02-23T16:26:12 <bens01> Justin_o, I also have a curl version that failed at first, but works now, going to put that in a loop and see how it behaves
2016-02-23T16:26:42 <Justin_o> bens01: great thanks

2016-02-23T17:09:57 <cindyli> simonjb, with UIO and GPII integration, (wireframe: https://www.dropbox.com/s/i4c3pni6cnnwuts/uioptions%20GPII%20integration.pdf?dl=0), the export saves the UIO adjusted prefs to GPII. Just wanna double check that the OAuth ways for creating a new GPII pref set and updating ann existing GPII pref set haven\'t been implemented at GPII, right?

2016-02-23T17:34:43 <bens01> Justin_o, info on the ctrl+alt+r issue:
2016-02-23T17:34:52 <bens01> Justin_o, Set up: load https://first-discovery.mybluemix.net/demos/prefsServerIntegration/index.html?preview=electron. Set breakpoint at infusion-custom.js:32713. Enable pause on exceptions in source tab of chrome dev tools.
2016-02-23T17:35:08 <bens01> Justin_o, Replicate: Click on first discovery tool and press ctrl+alt+r. You will break at infusion-custom.js:32713. The ctrl+alt+r keypress works. Click continue in the debugger. You\'ll break at infusion-custom.js:18080. The fluid.shadowForComponent(that) call returns null for the component typeName="gpii.firstDiscovery.keyboardInput". Execution haults and the remainder of of the fluid.prefs.prefsEditor.reset does not execute.
2016-02-23T17:37:35 <Justin_o> bens01: thanks, i\'ll take a look at that
