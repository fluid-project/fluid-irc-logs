2016-08-08T16:10:52 <PaliwalSparsh> Hi Please can anyone help me i was trying to save cookie using infusion built in component fluid.prefs.cookieStore, which can be found here
2016-08-08T16:10:59 <PaliwalSparsh> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/preferences/js/Store.js#L109
2016-08-08T16:11:50 <PaliwalSparsh> Please can anyone clear why we need path. I think there is a default folder ie place where cookies are stored.

2016-08-08T16:41:07 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: regarding the cookie path, it\'s optional. So you don\'t need to include it. Here\'s an answer as to what it was for http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/12439/cookie-path-protection-within-same-domain

2016-08-08T16:46:07 <PaliwalSparsh> Justin_o: Thanks for the link. I had set the path to "/", though it is optional for clearity.
2016-08-08T16:46:13 <jhung> Justin_o: I guess it can be closed. It\'s been a while.
2016-08-08T16:46:19 <jhung> I\'ll close it Justin_o

2016-08-08T17:39:51 <danayo> great, thanks TPark
2016-08-08T17:56:44 <michelled> alanharnum: I was thinking your 3L wiki page should be linked to from here https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/%28Floe%29+Preference+Exploration+and+Self-Assessment

2016-08-08T17:57:04 <alanharnum> michelled: yup, i think so too
2016-08-08T17:57:29 <michelled> please add it when you get a chance, thx!
2016-08-08T17:58:26 <michelled> danayo, sepidehshahi: do you think that Floe wiki page is the best thing to link to from the Floe project site?
2016-08-08T17:58:36 <michelled> for My3L work https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/%28Floe%29+Preference+Exploration+and+Self-Assessment
2016-08-08T17:59:42 <sepidehshahi> michelled: I think the page that alanharnum has created is a better landing page for MyL3 and from there we can link to the page that you just shared
2016-08-08T17:59:49 <sepidehshahi> what do you think danayo

On the card we say: inclusive communities can create new strategies to enhance credit and ownership, for example, designing in the open can result in greater recognition by creating a living portfolio of contributions to the work.
