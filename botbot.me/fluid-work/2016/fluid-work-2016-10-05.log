b'2016-10-05T22:01:24 <gloob> colinclark: sure it will, have fun!
2016-10-05T22:01:42 <gloob> simonjb: thank you
2016-10-05T22:02:00 <avtar> gloob: thanks for your ps1 work
2016-10-05T22:02:31 <avtar> i don\'t know if you were online when simon and i were wondering if batch files had a bash equivalent of "set -e"
2016-10-05T22:02:32 <gloob> avtar: it is not landed, wait for it, maybe it is going to create more problems that solutions
2016-10-05T22:02:42 <gloob> avtar: no
2016-10-05T22:02:50 <gloob> avtar: I mean, I didnt read that
2016-10-05T22:03:10 <avtar> gloob: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13859311/is-there-a-set-e-for-a-dos-batch-script
2016-10-05T22:03:17 <gloob> si, environment?
2016-10-05T22:03:50 <gloob> ah ok
2016-10-05T22:04:00 <gloob> yes, that works in PS too
2016-10-05T22:04:09 <gloob> in fact I guess with only one pipe
2016-10-05T22:04:15 <gloob> but I see code doing that
2016-10-05T22:04:37 <gloob> although you also have functions, you have exit codes, you have try/catchs and throws
2016-10-05T22:05:07 <gloob> try/catch and throws is the most solid approach and repetitive strategy I saw in the powershell things I read
2016-10-05T22:05:42 <gloob> but also the set -e thing with the OR thing
2016-10-05T22:06:09 * jessm has quit
2016-10-05T22:06:28 <gloob> which is the problem you want to solve?
2016-10-05T22:06:44 <avtar> well
2016-10-05T22:07:22 <avtar> ideally i would want these scripts to fail reliably without adding pipes everywhere
2016-10-05T22:07:51 <gloob> well, currently with the ps stuff they are bubbling up the errors
2016-10-05T22:08:21 <gloob> or you can explicitely break the execution
2016-10-05T22:08:40 <gloob> and return a non-zero exit code
2016-10-05T22:09:06 <gloob> I tried to minimize the code in the "client side" and rely on the functions of the module
2016-10-05T22:09:14 <avtar> stopping everything and freaking out seems like a reasonable thing to do for the build
2016-10-05T22:09:18 <gloob> yes
2016-10-05T22:09:27 <gloob> in fact we take that decision
2016-10-05T22:09:45 <gloob> I think I documented it in one of the issue
2016-10-05T22:10:04 <gloob> but giovanni and alfredo and I gess you too said ok to break
2016-10-05T22:10:07 <gloob> always
2016-10-05T22:10:12 <gloob> if something fails
2016-10-05T22:10:39 <gloob> 00:10 < gloob> but giovanni and alfredo and I gess you too said ok to break                                                                                                          \xe2\x94\x82\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7
2016-10-05T22:10:47 <gloob> I mean, alfredo and you

2016-10-05T19:28:04 <simonjb> awesome
2016-10-05T19:28:46 <simonjb> and does this provide a workaround/fix for the npm stack issue?

2016-10-05T19:58:35 <cindyli> gtirloni: in ur GPII-2060 branch, the flag of nodejs_npm_symlinks is there. Is it still needed?
2016-10-05T19:58:38 <cindyli> https://github.com/gtirloni/ansible-role-nodejs/blob/GPII-2060/defaults/main.yml#L20
2016-10-05T19:59:35 <cindyli> i think it\'s no longer needed to switch that flag based on the platform of the host machine, right?
2016-10-05T19:59:50 <gtirloni> cindyli: good catch, i should remove that, thanks
2016-10-05T20:07:45 <avtar> stegru: ping
2016-10-05T20:08:20 <cindyli> gtirloni: i was also trying this branch. what i did: rm -rf node_modules/; vagrant destroy; npm install; vagrant up

2016-10-05T20:12:05 <gtirloni> seems unrelated to these changes. ansible is failing to install the \'facts\' module.
2016-10-05T20:12:28 <gtirloni> try: vagrant ssh.. then go to the universal directory and run: sudo ansible-galaxy install -fr provisioning/requirements.yml

2016-10-05T20:15:59 <cindyli> - nodejs was installed successfully
2016-10-05T20:16:04 <cindyli> so permission issue
2016-10-05T20:16:34 <gtirloni> that\'s what vagrant up does as well.. i\'m at a loss here :)
2016-10-05T20:16:45 <cindyli> umm..

2016-10-05T20:33:50 <alanharnum> gtirloni cindyli: I\'m uncertain if it tells us anything but I ran the same sequence of commands and didn\'t get an error
2016-10-05T20:35:44 <cindyli> alanharnum, gtirloni, avtar just helped to figure out what\'s wrong with my provisioning/requirements.yml, in my paste of that file above, note there\'s such line: - src: git+https://github.com/gtirloni/ansible-role-nodejs.git
2016-10-05T20:36:05 <cindyli> replacing "git+https" with "git" fixes that
2016-10-05T20:36:51 <avtar> alanharnum, cindyli, gtirloni: this works as well https://www.pastery.net/muamgv/
2016-10-05T20:38:44 <alanharnum> avtar: this worked for me: https://gist.github.com/waharnum/beca374dcf566e425d137b84fab47abb

2016-10-05T20:43:07 <gtirloni> maybe a transient failure to download the role got fixed by the time you changed the file and ran vagrant again? are you on wireless?
2016-10-05T20:44:22 <gtirloni> glad it worked anyway :) that won\'t be necessary if this gets accepted

2016-10-05T21:38:47 <avtar> i\'ll close my pr

2016-10-05T21:39:52 <avtar> imo fixing the build sooner than later seems preferable

2016-10-05T13:01:44 <Bosmon> But an extra pair of eyes on the pull would be very helpful
2016-10-05T13:03:09 <Justin_o> Bosmon: cool thanks

2016-10-05T13:43:37 <cindyli1> gtirloni: there\'s an issue with the new fix for the stack error - https://github.com/idi-ops/ansible-nodejs/pull/33. "npm install" passes at least the module of "gpii-pouchdb" was not pulled correctly so that running universal tests (node tests/all-tests.js) fails with this error:
2016-10-05T13:43:39 <cindyli1> Unhandled rejection Error: Error: /home/vagrant/sync/node_modules/universal/node_modules/leveldown/build/Release/leveldown.node: invalid ELF header: unable to import leveldown
2016-10-05T13:43:49 <cindyli1> "invalid ELF header"
2016-10-05T13:44:05 <gtirloni> ok, let me check
2016-10-05T13:44:17 <cindyli1> i searched on this error and found one work around: https://github.com/Level/levelup/issues/340
2016-10-05T13:53:55 * jhung has quit
2016-10-05T13:54:05 <gtirloni> cindyli1: they all pass here using your branch
2016-10-05T13:54:36 <gtirloni> cindyli1: the ELF header error indicates the architecture/operating system is different form the one the OS expects
2016-10-05T13:54:56 * cindyli1 is now known as cindyli
2016-10-05T13:54:57 <gtirloni> cindyli1: maybe you had node_modules created on OSX and when running the tests Linux tried to load it?
2016-10-05T13:55:10 <gtirloni> in which case, deleting node_modules and running `vagrant provision` should fix that
2016-10-05T13:55:10 <cindyli> very possible
2016-10-05T13:55:17 <cindyli> trying

2016-10-05T14:06:24 <cindyli> gtirloni: yes, that fixes "invalid ELD header". thanks. did you try running tests in the vagrant VM? I tried again and hit the error of "pouch component error:the \'leveldown\' package is not available. install it, or, specify another storage backend using the \'db\' option"
2016-10-05T14:06:48 <cindyli> this file: node_modules/leveldown/build/Release/leveldown.node, was not pulled out at all
2016-10-05T14:07:02 <gtirloni> yes, inside the VM.. what I did: git pull, vagrant destroy -f, vagrant up, grunt tests
2016-10-05T14:07:39 <gtirloni> destroy/up shouldn\'t be required, `vagrant provision` will pick up from where `vagrant up` left and continue installing things

2016-10-05T14:08:22 <cindyli> yes, gtirloni, i did destroy then up. what i did:
2016-10-05T14:08:23 <cindyli> rm -rf node_modules
2016-10-05T14:08:28 <cindyli> vagrant destroy
2016-10-05T14:08:33 <cindyli> vagrant up

2016-10-05T14:09:35 <cindyli> of course, if on my local machine, running "ls node_modules/leveldown/build/Release/leveldown.node" doesn\'t find that file too
2016-10-05T14:09:38 <gtirloni> I think I ran a different set of tests here with `grunt tests`
2016-10-05T14:10:26 <cindyli> right, gtirloni, u need to run "grunt node-tests"
2016-10-05T14:10:39 <gtirloni> let me run that
2016-10-05T14:10:49 <cindyli> umm. task "tests" should run both browser and node tests
2016-10-05T14:10:58 <gtirloni> yeah, they look similar
2016-10-05T14:11:00 <cindyli> interesting. i\'m trying too
2016-10-05T14:11:27 <gtirloni> are there any changes you have to push to your repo? just double checking
2016-10-05T14:12:10 <cindyli> no, gtirloni
2016-10-05T14:12:20 <cindyli> just the change to use ur pull
2016-10-05T14:12:50 <gtirloni> ok. the most drastic well to clean everything: vagrant destroy -f; rm -rf .vagrant; rm -rf node_modules; vagrant up
2016-10-05T14:13:12 <gtirloni> node-tests passed
2016-10-05T14:13:44 <gtirloni> $ file node_modules/leveldown/build/Release/leveldown.node

2016-10-05T14:15:27 <cindyli> weird u cannot produce this issue. the CI triggered by my pull request fails the node tests at the same spot: https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/464#partial-pull-merging
2016-10-05T14:16:52 <gtirloni> i\'ll try to retrieve that PR specifically and build from it, one sec
2016-10-05T14:16:59 * lliskovoi joined the channel
2016-10-05T14:19:41 <gtirloni> still using your branch, i entered the VM, cleaned node_modules, ran `npm install` and leveldown is missing.. very interesting
2016-10-05T14:22:21 <gtirloni> the error i see is a missing \'prebuild\' executable, see this: https://github.com/level/leveldown/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20prebuild
2016-10-05T14:24:22 <cindyli> gtirloni: the error you get tells it\'s a missing \'prebuild\' executable? i don\'t see that error
2016-10-05T14:24:48 <cindyli> my error complaints "\'leveldown\' package is not available."
2016-10-05T14:24:50 <gtirloni> rm -rf node_modules && npm install ... once it\'s down, scroll up all the way past the dependency tree
2016-10-05T14:25:02 <gtirloni> s/down/done
2016-10-05T14:25:05 <cindyli> ah
2016-10-05T14:27:50 <gtirloni> it seems leveldown needs the gyp package (and the node-pre-gyp), which is not installed by GPII/universal (but is by GPII/linux)
2016-10-05T14:28:06 <gtirloni> https://github.com/GPII/linux/blob/master/provisioning/vars.yml#L32
2016-10-05T14:28:59 <gtirloni> try this inside the VM: sudo dnf install -y gyp && sudo npm install -g node-gyp && rm -rf node_modules && npm install
2016-10-05T14:29:53 <gtirloni> (from universal\'s dir)
2016-10-05T14:30:30 <gtirloni> the problem is... GPII/universal is becoming Linux-only now
2016-10-05T14:32:18 <gtirloni> I\'m not sure that was always the case, it might have been anyway
2016-10-05T14:33:46 <gtirloni> i also had to install prebuild: sudo npm install -g prebuild

2016-10-05T14:35:54 <Justin_o> cindyli, simonjb: Bosmon is the primary reviewer of this PR ( https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/pull/86 ); however, due to its size, he\'s hoping that someone else could provide a second set of eyes on it. Would either or both of you have time to look it over and leave any necessary comments on it?

2016-10-05T14:44:37 <cindyli> i will try, gtirloni. just to make sure i understand, as i rmb, you use a linux machine, right? does this error happen with your host machine without gyp? just wanna get a sense if it\'s vagrant or vm related
2016-10-05T14:45:28 <cindyli> Justin_o, simonjb, i will have a look
2016-10-05T14:45:33 <gtirloni> cindyli: i use linux, but i didn\'t try installing/building it locally, i\'m always using vagrant up/destroy here.. in any case, it\'s weird leveldown got installed for me but when i attempted `npm install` inside the VM, it didn\'t
2016-10-05T14:46:03 <cindyli> gtirloni: ok, sounds like it\'s vagrant related
2016-10-05T14:46:25 <cindyli> well, it\'s vagrant vm related from very beginning
2016-10-05T14:46:39 <gtirloni> not sure it\'s vagrant\'s fault, i think the pouchdb dependency is adding some requirements which are not being installed
2016-10-05T14:47:21 <cindyli> right, but those requirements are not required with a local machine, gtirloni
2016-10-05T14:47:28 <gtirloni> no?
2016-10-05T14:48:05 <gtirloni> it seems leveldown needs node-gyp, etc..
2016-10-05T14:48:20 <cindyli> well, isn\'t it true that with ur local linux system, "npm install" pulls leveldown without requiring node-gyp?
2016-10-05T14:48:32 <cindyli> but when running in vm, gyp is required?
2016-10-05T14:48:53 <gtirloni> no, i never tried npm install on my local system. the weird part is that `vagrant up` pulled leveldown, but from inside the VM running `npm install` manually.. it didn\'t.
2016-10-05T14:49:26 <gtirloni> gyp should be required inside and outside the VM.. I didn\'t try npm install locally. sorry, i may haven\'t been clear about that
2016-10-05T14:49:58 <cindyli> gtirloni: can i call u?
2016-10-05T14:51:00 <gtirloni> sure, vidyo opened

2016-10-05T16:06:13 <clown> gtirloni: Regarding: your question, "Have you updated all Fedora packages by any chance?"  (https://github.com/idi-ops/packer-fedora/pull/8#issuecomment-251718283), I\'m not sure what you mean.
2016-10-05T16:06:43 <clown> I build the box based on this pull request using the makefile in idi-ops.
2016-10-05T16:06:46 <gtirloni> if you ran `dnf update` or asked the package manager to update everything. it may have notified you there were updates
2016-10-05T16:06:47 <clown> *built
2016-10-05T16:07:01 <gtirloni> ahh, you\'re building the actual box
2016-10-05T16:07:07 <gtirloni> ok, then you definitely got all the updates
2016-10-05T16:07:18 <clown> okay, good.

2016-10-05T16:26:44 <Justin_o> simonjb: was looking over https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Infusion+Merge+Checklist
2016-10-05T16:30:51 <Justin_o> I have a few comments. 1) it doesn\'t mention testing the demos and etc. which may be affected by the changes 2) I think there are probably a bunch of different flows for ensuring a clean branch so we may want to be general and suggest a few ways of doing that 3) I also think it\'s important to verify that your master branch is clean, again we can be general
2016-10-05T16:30:51 <Justin_o> and suggest ways of doing that 4) there are some post merge tasks like commenting on the PR with the merge commit hash and making sure that the JIRAs are set the correct status (it should automatically switch to resolved, but we should close it if possible too )
2016-10-05T16:31:37 <Justin_o> simonjb: oh and another thing, we should make sure that we\'re testing with the branch merged with the code from master, in case the PR branch is out of date
