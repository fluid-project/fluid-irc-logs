2016-08-26T15:56:36 <stegru> it\'s amazing how many problems where created by that single issue

2016-08-26T16:40:07 <kavya> cindyli: Hi
2016-08-26T16:40:14 <cindyli> hi kavya
2016-08-26T16:42:20 <kavya> I am trying to understand how to workaround with payloads..and want to ask if you can give me demo on this
2016-08-26T16:44:55 <cindyli> sure, kavya, vidyo or skype?
2016-08-26T16:45:13 <cindyli> first i need to understand what the problem is
2016-08-26T16:45:26 <kavya> skype
2016-08-26T17:20:33 <kavya> Thanks cindy.. :)
2016-08-26T17:24:53 <simonjb> hi Bosmon7, I\'ve started on some manual testing of the journalling work and had some questions
2016-08-26T17:26:36 <simonjb> there are some differences between GPII-101 and what has been implemented -- is GPII-101 relevant here? I mention it because Sandra included it in the description of the PR
2016-08-26T17:26:52 <simonjb> in her plan
2016-08-26T17:27:10 <simonjb> Bosmon also ^ :)
2016-08-26T17:29:29 <Bosmon7> simonjb - yes, the specific implementation strategy ended up diverging a bit from the description in GPII-101
2016-08-26T17:29:41 <Bosmon7> It is relevant, but that JIRA was written over 3 years ago : P
2016-08-26T17:30:06 <Bosmon7> Looks like I\'d already thought better by the time of the 1st comment
2016-08-26T17:30:13 <Bosmon7> Which describes a system more similar to the one implemented
2016-08-26T17:30:20 <simonjb> cool, thanks, I won\'t bother with noting differences then :)
2016-08-26T17:31:18 <simonjb> it seems when I apply a journal, the system logs in a user "restore" and I can\'t log that user out or log anyone else in
2016-08-26T17:31:34 <simonjb> what\'s the expected behaviour here?
2016-08-26T17:33:15 <Bosmon7> simonjb I see
2016-08-26T17:33:30 <Bosmon7> This seems faulty
2016-08-26T17:33:41 <simonjb> ok, I\'ll make a note on the PR
2016-08-26T17:33:44 <Bosmon7> Thanks
2016-08-26T17:33:51 <Bosmon7> I\'ll add a fix and test cases for this scenario
2016-08-26T17:33:54 <simonjb> wanted to check in case I was missing something
2016-08-26T17:34:09 * the-t-in-rtf joined the channel
2016-08-26T17:34:11 <Bosmon7> I\'d generally assumed that starting up the GPII for the purposes of making a restore was a "one-shot deal"
2016-08-26T17:34:28 <Bosmon7> But we can\'t tolerate the system being jammed in this way
2016-08-26T17:34:33 <simonjb> start up GPII, restore, restart?
2016-08-26T17:34:50 <Bosmon7> Yes - my original idea was that the restore would just be a command-line utility or so
2016-08-26T17:34:58 <simonjb> got it
2016-08-26T17:35:04 <Bosmon7> But I imagine it will in the end be some kind of task tray menu item or so
2016-08-26T17:35:28 <Bosmon7> And it will naturally expect the GPII to keep functioning...
2016-08-26T17:38:48 <kavya> Great..I will make a note of it
2016-08-26T17:44:26 <simonjb> Bosmon7 and kavya, I\'ve added some notes to the PR https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/463 and will keep testing and looking over the code
2016-08-26T17:44:39 <simonjb> apologies for not getting to it sooner
