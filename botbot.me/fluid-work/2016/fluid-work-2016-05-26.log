b'2016-05-26T22:37:04 <colinclark> if not, I really don\'t have much to do tonight
2016-05-26T22:37:10 <colinclark> so I\'ll grab something to eat and keep chipping away
2016-05-26T22:37:15 <colinclark> right, yes
2016-05-26T22:37:38 <Bosmon7> We\'d need to change our requires to read fluid.require("%universal")
2016-05-26T22:38:03 <Bosmon7> After 5 years we finally find what fluid.require is for....
2016-05-26T22:38:30 <colinclark> :) :)
2016-05-26T22:38:31 <colinclark> i\'m so excited
2016-05-26T22:38:33 <colinclark> we\'re getting close
2016-05-26T22:38:39 <Bosmon7> Just as npm 3 makes it *almost*, but not quite irrelevant :)
2016-05-26T22:38:54 <colinclark> I think our Windows vagrant box is missing Python, which I believe is required for building any Windows native modules
2016-05-26T22:39:02 <colinclark> but I wonder why that wasn\'t an issue with Node 0.10.x
2016-05-26T22:39:04 <Bosmon7> But it has VS 2013 on it?
2016-05-26T22:39:07 <colinclark> yes
2016-05-26T22:39:08 <colinclark> it does
2016-05-26T22:39:19 <Bosmon7> It wasn\'t an issue because we NEVER BUILT ANY WINDOWS NATIVE MODULES :)
2016-05-26T22:39:22 <colinclark> ah!
2016-05-26T22:39:24 <colinclark> :)
2016-05-26T22:39:27 <Bosmon7> Because we widely believed this to be impossible
2016-05-26T22:39:30 <Bosmon7> They were all committed as binaries
2016-05-26T22:39:57 <Bosmon7> Although it\'s slightly astonishing that stuff like express and socket.io would build
2016-05-26T22:40:05 <Bosmon7> I never quite understood through what accident this happened
2016-05-26T22:40:07 <colinclark> not to pressure you but only beause I\'m excited... do you have a blind fix yet, Bosmon7
2016-05-26T22:40:13 <Bosmon7> colinclark - yes I committed a while ago
2016-05-26T22:40:22 <colinclark> ok
2016-05-26T22:40:24 <colinclark> in your 1318?
2016-05-26T22:40:26 <Bosmon7> [23:33] <Bosmon7> Ok, well I\'ve updated my branch
2016-05-26T22:40:27 <Bosmon7> Yes
2016-05-26T22:40:30 <colinclark> ah sorry
2016-05-26T22:40:32 <colinclark> i missed that
2016-05-26T22:41:10 <Bosmon7> Evidence suggests that under node 0.10 there was some kind of thing as a "weak native module" that didn\'t seem to require the full build chain to be available
2016-05-26T22:42:04 <Bosmon7> Ok, so if I merge in your branch to mine, I should be able to run "vagrant up" and have it go?
2016-05-26T22:42:13 <colinclark> I believe so, yes
2016-05-26T22:42:20 <colinclark> perhaps eat dinner beforehand :)
2016-05-26T22:42:24 <colinclark> you have vagrant installed
2016-05-26T22:42:24 <colinclark> ?
2016-05-26T22:43:14 <Bosmon7> Well we got a lot of SANGWIDGES at guild
2016-05-26T22:43:17 <Bosmon7> It is almost bedtime
2016-05-26T22:43:25 <Bosmon7> Very early trip to the hospital tomorrow morning
2016-05-26T22:43:30 <colinclark> here\'s instructions in case of vagrant issues
2016-05-26T22:43:32 <colinclark> https://github.com/GPII/qi-development-environments
2016-05-26T22:43:33 <Bosmon7> I have typed "VAGRANT UP" and it has paused ominously
2016-05-26T22:43:37 <colinclark> but I will merge your branch and test it righ tnow
2016-05-26T22:43:48 <Bosmon7> Oh wow
2016-05-26T22:43:50 <Bosmon7> This is odd
2016-05-26T22:43:58 <Bosmon7> "No usable default provider could be found for your system."
2016-05-26T22:44:14 <Bosmon7> It\'s possible I got partway through getting vagrant running on this system and gave up
2016-05-26T22:44:19 <colinclark> oh dear
2016-05-26T22:44:54 <avtar> Bosmon7: do you have virtualbox installed?
2016-05-26T22:45:10 <Bosmon7> Well, that\'s possibly the partway that I got to : P
2016-05-26T22:45:23 <Bosmon7> I do have vastly more diskspace available on this machine than the last time I tried this
2016-05-26T22:45:42 <colinclark> I have a major problem with diskspace on this mac
2016-05-26T22:45:47 <colinclark> i\'m constantly destroying boxes
2016-05-26T22:47:43 <colinclark> still reprovisioning
2016-05-26T22:47:51 <colinclark> i stupidly destroyed the box
2016-05-26T22:47:55 <colinclark> instead of just halting it
2016-05-26T22:49:17 <Bosmon7> Urgh
2016-05-26T22:49:26 <Bosmon7> This install says it\'s going to cut my network connections
2016-05-26T22:49:30 <Bosmon7> I remember this junk
2016-05-26T22:50:37 <Bosmon7> Well this is odd
2016-05-26T22:50:42 <Bosmon7> I must have succeeded in installing this before
2016-05-26T22:50:54 <Bosmon7> It\'s got a first-discovery-server in it
2016-05-26T22:51:20 <Bosmon7> Well, a reference to one, which has been destroyed
2016-05-26T22:52:13 <Bosmon7> Ok, well, I\'ve got VirtualBox installed and vagrant up still gives the same message
2016-05-26T22:52:16 <colinclark> yes avtar mentioned to me that you had indeed run the first discovery server
2016-05-26T22:52:25 <colinclark> ok, your fix seems to pass
2016-05-26T22:52:42 <colinclark> unit tests anyway
2016-05-26T22:53:05 <colinclark> the acceptance tests, unfortunately, fail quite hard
2016-05-26T22:53:22 <colinclark> 22:52:38.530:  FATAL ERROR: Uncaught exception: Module did not self-register.
2016-05-26T22:53:28 <colinclark> in the gsettings_bridge.js file
2016-05-26T22:54:06 <Bosmon7> Ok
2016-05-26T22:54:13 <colinclark> Looks like on this line:
2016-05-26T22:54:13 <colinclark> var nodeGSettings = require("./nodegsettings/build/Release/nodegsettings.node");
2016-05-26T22:54:31 <Bosmon7> ok
2016-05-26T22:54:54 <Bosmon7> That\'s hard to explain
2016-05-26T22:55:16 <Bosmon7> I\'ve got an ETA indeed of about half an hour on downloading this VM
2016-05-26T22:55:50 <colinclark> ouch
2016-05-26T22:55:53 <colinclark> do you want to share my mac?
2016-05-26T22:55:54 <colinclark> and work there?
2016-05-26T22:56:21 <Bosmon7> I think that problem you have seen will be caused by having the wrong version of node visible on the path
2016-05-26T22:56:31 <colinclark> ok, interesting
2016-05-26T22:56:36 <colinclark> let\'s have a look
2016-05-26T22:56:58 <Bosmon7> I don\'t know how you\'re meant to install recent versions of node on fedora anyway
2016-05-26T22:57:05 <Bosmon7> I just unzipped the distro into my home directory
2016-05-26T22:57:18 <colinclark> I believe we use the nodesource repositories
2016-05-26T22:57:25 <colinclark> they maintain rpms
2016-05-26T22:57:29 <Bosmon7> But this sounds like you are now grappling with genuine problems rather than ones caused by my screwups
2016-05-26T22:57:30 <colinclark> for Fedora and CentOS
2016-05-26T22:58:12 <Bosmon7> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28486891/uncaught-error-module-did-not-self-register
2016-05-26T22:58:29 <colinclark> ok
2016-05-26T22:58:37 <colinclark> perhaps it\'s something I can fix
2016-05-26T22:59:01 * gloob_ has quit
2016-05-26T22:59:29 <Bosmon7> I\'m not sure how your unit tests could have passed though
2016-05-26T22:59:35 <Bosmon7> Since they will execute exactly the same line
2016-05-26T22:59:39 <colinclark> yes
2016-05-26T23:00:05 <Bosmon7> Did you see the gsettings tests apparently scroll by?
2016-05-26T23:00:26 <colinclark> I have some further information
2016-05-26T23:00:32 <colinclark> based on running the tests directly in the VM
2016-05-26T23:00:47 <colinclark> it\'s as if I\'ve got the wrong compiled version of the gsettings bridge somehow
2016-05-26T23:00:52 <Bosmon7> yes
2016-05-26T23:00:53 <colinclark> there aren\'t any lingering binaries, right?
2016-05-26T23:00:58 <colinclark> in the repo
2016-05-26T23:01:01 <Bosmon7> There were never binaries in the linux repo
2016-05-26T23:01:07 <Bosmon7> We only pulled that dastardly trick on Windows
2016-05-26T23:01:19 <colinclark> http://pastie.org/10854036
2016-05-26T23:01:57 <Bosmon7> colinclark - right
2016-05-26T23:02:09 <Bosmon7> I can\'t imagine how you don\'t get exactly the same failure when running the gsettings unit tests
2016-05-26T23:02:53 <Bosmon7> But this will be some issue relating to the build or node installation that is outside my experience
2016-05-26T23:03:20 <Bosmon7> btw - isn\'t it a requirement that we use Fedora 23 now?
2016-05-26T23:03:30 <Bosmon7> I believe Javi said so
2016-05-26T23:03:48 <colinclark> This doesn\'t fairly answer your question
2016-05-26T23:03:53 <Bosmon7> He\'s bound to an API within gsettings that doesn\'t exist on Fedora 22
2016-05-26T23:03:59 <Bosmon7> Or so I understood him to say
2016-05-26T23:04:02 <colinclark> oh fuck
2016-05-26T23:04:04 <colinclark> maybe that\'s it?
2016-05-26T23:04:10 <Bosmon7> It\'s certainly a possibility
2016-05-26T23:04:15 <colinclark> but I figure our supported version of Linux is whatever is built by the vagrant scripts
2016-05-26T23:04:23 <Bosmon7> When I asked him about this, he said that "avtar is aware of this" : P
2016-05-26T23:04:36 <colinclark> i just had my head in my hands
2016-05-26T23:04:47 <colinclark> "avtar, you didn\'t happen to build a vagrant box for Fedora 23, eh?"
2016-05-26T23:04:53 <colinclark> avtar said "did!"
2016-05-26T23:04:56 <Bosmon7> ok
2016-05-26T23:04:57 <colinclark> let\'s rock this
2016-05-26T23:05:02 <Bosmon7> It\'s worth a try
2016-05-26T23:05:08 <colinclark> i\'d say you should go to bed, Bosmon7
2016-05-26T23:05:12 <Bosmon7> ok
2016-05-26T23:05:12 <colinclark> sounds like a big day tomorrow
2016-05-26T23:05:15 <colinclark> I\'ll do what I can
2016-05-26T23:05:20 <Bosmon7> This VM will still take another 20 minutes to dl anyway
2016-05-26T23:05:24 <colinclark> yeah
2016-05-26T23:05:28 <colinclark> i\'m on a fast network here
2016-05-26T23:05:29 <Bosmon7> And then goodness knows how much longer than that to actually provision : P
2016-05-26T23:05:32 <colinclark> and it\'s still daylight
2016-05-26T23:05:40 <colinclark> provisioning can be very slow the first time
2016-05-26T23:06:02 <Bosmon7> ok, good luck!
2016-05-26T23:06:07 <colinclark> thanks
2016-05-26T23:06:15 <Bosmon7> We\'re certainly making massive progress
2016-05-26T23:06:25 <colinclark> yes
2016-05-26T23:06:27 <colinclark> quite massive
2016-05-26T23:08:01 <colinclark> i appreciate your help tonight, Bosmon7
2016-05-26T23:08:02 <colinclark> thanks again
2016-05-26T23:08:58 <Bosmon7> colinclark - thanks for your hard plugging away at the repos today!
2016-05-26T23:09:09 <Bosmon7> And sorry for my blunder in updating universal without retesting the linux repo again.....
2016-05-26T23:09:50 <colinclark> no worries
2016-05-26T23:09:59 <colinclark> that\'s why we\'ve been working on this automation
2016-05-26T23:10:02 <colinclark> and clearly it\'s a work in progress
2016-05-26T23:12:25 <colinclark> avtar: Does this help at all? https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/issues/802

2016-05-26T18:30:56 <alanharnum> colinclark: it went well given the constraints - I was the final presenter and the AV system couldn\'t accomodate the actual demo setup, so I basically just went up on stage, talked about the rings and what the GPII did really quickly, then told them to go to gpii.net before they kicked us offstage for the keynoter
2016-05-26T18:31:08 <colinclark> wow

2016-05-26T22:16:50 <colinclark> I\'ve managed actually get the right version of npm and node running in Vagrant on linux
2016-05-26T22:17:00 <colinclark> avtar is sorting through path problems with npm in Windows in Vagrant right now
2016-05-26T22:17:42 <colinclark> Bosmon: On Linux, I am seeing failures with exceptions being thrown in the Linux unit tests
2016-05-26T22:17:48 <colinclark> TypeError: fluid.getLoader is not a function
2016-05-26T22:18:01 <colinclark> Does this suggest an old universal or Infusion is getting loaded somehow?

2016-05-26T22:19:18 <Bosmon7> Can you point to what line they seem to be failing from?
2016-05-26T22:20:05 <colinclark> Not the way I am running them now, but I will see
2016-05-26T22:20:24 <Bosmon7> You get fluid.getLoader is not a function without a stack trace?
2016-05-26T22:20:39 <colinclark> oh no, sorry
2016-05-26T22:20:41 <colinclark> I do have a stack trace
2016-05-26T22:20:51 <colinclark> and it\'s occurring in the gsettingsBridge
2016-05-26T22:21:00 <colinclark> at Object.<anonymous> (/home/vagrant/sync/gpii/node_modules/gsettingsBridge/index.js:19:20)
2016-05-26T22:22:28 <colinclark> https://github.com/amb26/linux/blob/GPII-1318/gpii/node_modules/gsettingsBridge/index.js#L19
2016-05-26T22:23:27 <Bosmon7> Very odd
2016-05-26T22:23:46 <Bosmon7> Perhaps I simply fucked up
2016-05-26T22:23:53 <Bosmon7> But I guess that\'s very easy with our current dependence structure
2016-05-26T22:24:11 <colinclark> this is the first step towards improving, I think
2016-05-26T22:24:13 <colinclark> this branch
2016-05-26T22:25:11 <colinclark> or rather, these branches
2016-05-26T22:25:19 <Bosmon7> Unfortunately I am on my tiny laptop which will make running linux tests almost impossible
2016-05-26T22:25:26 <Bosmon7> But I can issue you a "blind fix"...
2016-05-26T22:25:30 <colinclark> ok
2016-05-26T22:25:39 <colinclark> can you give me a gist?
2016-05-26T22:25:42 <colinclark> and i\'ll try it here
2016-05-26T22:25:49 <Bosmon7> I\'ll just commit it
2016-05-26T22:25:53 <Bosmon7> It can hardly make things worse : P
2016-05-26T22:25:57 <colinclark> hahaha
2016-05-26T22:26:02 <colinclark> things aren\'t so bad :)
2016-05-26T22:26:17 <colinclark> Not now, but for the future...
2016-05-26T22:26:29 <colinclark> is your tiny laptop too tiny to run a Vagrant VM of Linux?
2016-05-26T22:26:39 <colinclark> I have to say I really love testing this way
2016-05-26T22:26:42 <Bosmon7> Well, almost
2016-05-26T22:26:45 <colinclark> at least prior to SHIPPING IT
2016-05-26T22:26:49 <Bosmon7> It would probably take about 20 minutes to come up
2016-05-26T22:26:50 <colinclark> but I also have 16 GB of RAM
2016-05-26T22:26:52 <colinclark> ah yes
2016-05-26T22:27:02 <colinclark> Poor old reliable moonbook
2016-05-26T22:27:12 <Bosmon7> It does have a Fedora VM but it is still a Fedora 19 one
2016-05-26T22:27:19 <Bosmon7> I haven\'t worked Linux on this laptop for a couple of years
2016-05-26T22:27:34 <colinclark> You\'d probably eat through a ton of Rachael\'s bandwidth by downloading the QI\'s vagrant 22 box
2016-05-26T22:27:46 <colinclark> avtar has just fixed the Windows npm issue!
2016-05-26T22:27:50 <Bosmon7> wow
2016-05-26T22:27:54 <Bosmon7> I didn\'t know it existed :)
2016-05-26T22:27:55 <Bosmon7> What was it?
2016-05-26T22:27:58 <colinclark> so we\'re very close
2016-05-26T22:28:10 <colinclark> I don\'t know exactly
2016-05-26T22:28:16 <colinclark> avtar can probably explain better than me
2016-05-26T22:28:33 <colinclark> but in short, it seems like some paths changed with the chocolatey packages from Node 0.10.x to 4.x
2016-05-26T22:28:40 <colinclark> chocolatey seems a little...
2016-05-26T22:28:43 <colinclark> poorly maintained
2016-05-26T22:28:57 <colinclark> so what is your fix, anyway, Bosmon7?
2016-05-26T22:29:50 * Justin_o has quit
2016-05-26T22:31:11 <Bosmon7> Well, this is all a bit crap... I wonder what the most efficient thing to do is
2016-05-26T22:31:34 <Bosmon7> I can certainly commit something "blind" and have you test it but it seems a bit ridiculous
2016-05-26T22:32:32 <Bosmon7> I remember trying to use the recommended steps to update a Fedora 19 VM to 23 and they failed completely horribly
2016-05-26T22:33:48 <Bosmon7> Ok, well I\'ve updated my branch
2016-05-26T22:34:05 <Bosmon7> It should fail less or differently to the previous one
2016-05-26T22:34:26 <Bosmon7> Also - if I wanted the vagrant stuff, it seems it needs to be merged in anyway
2016-05-26T22:34:36 <Bosmon7> Do you have a branch of avtar\'s that should go in?
2016-05-26T22:34:48 <colinclark> I have a branch
2016-05-26T22:34:56 <colinclark> let me just make sure both windows and linux are up to date
2016-05-26T22:35:16 <colinclark> but THE DEFINITIVE SOURCE is now my GPII-1318 branch
2016-05-26T22:35:19 <Bosmon7> So, we\'ll clearly need to abolish our ridiculous grunt-gpii stuff
2016-05-26T22:35:28 <colinclark> that\'ll be great :)
2016-05-26T22:35:33 <Bosmon7> It has no place in a modern world
2016-05-26T22:36:22 <Bosmon7> Yes, really this repo does absolutely nothing useful to us any more
2016-05-26T22:36:31 <colinclark> Bosmon7: https://github.com/colinbdclark/linux/tree/GPII-1318
2016-05-26T22:36:39 <colinclark> and https://github.com/colinbdclark/windows/tree/GPII-1318
2016-05-26T22:36:53 <colinclark> avtar is working up a pull request to my repo for the Windows fix
2016-05-26T22:36:59 <colinclark> and assuming the tests pass, we\'ll be good to go
2016-05-26T22:36:59 <Bosmon7> And my new module loading stuff resolves any remaining bootstrap issues that we would have through treating universal as a perfectly normal dependency

2016-05-26T17:07:57 <colinclark> I want to standardize on a way to run tests
2016-05-26T17:08:08 <colinclark> so that it\'s easy to run browser tests, node tests, and all tests
2016-05-26T17:08:15 <colinclark> and do so with Vagrant or locally
2016-05-26T17:08:28 <colinclark> I guess in some cases we\'ve wired things up to "npm test" and in other cases with grunt
