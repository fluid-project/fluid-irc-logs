2016-05-04T20:16:42 <Bosmon2> Thanks for the feedback, cindyli
2016-05-04T20:17:09 <Bosmon2> Amazingly I discovered almost by accident some very ancient "deep equivalence tests" that got implemented in 2008
2016-05-04T20:17:11 <Bosmon2> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/commit/05fbb970ac3f827c178ed11cc4616ab64a43a594
2016-05-04T20:17:22 <Bosmon2> We had neglected them since they were not part of all-tests.html .....
2016-05-04T20:17:43 <cindyli> that\'s cool
2016-05-04T20:17:51 <Bosmon2> I\'ve copied the contents up into the new deepEq tests since now we have the "fail is pass" infrastructure which will allow them to run properly
2016-05-04T20:18:15 <Bosmon2> They had 4 tests which were meant to fail and so they just got left on the shelf for 6 years.....

2016-05-04T13:42:34 <avtar> jhernand1z: hi
2016-05-04T13:42:47 <avtar> no worries, i figured out the issue last night
2016-05-04T13:43:22 <avtar> we should have a fedora 23 box for you to continue testing with in about an hour or so
2016-05-04T13:43:32 <jhernand1z> avtar: sweeet!!!
2016-05-04T13:44:04 <jhernand1z> thanks for the heads up
2016-05-04T13:44:16 <jhernand1z> are you uploading it right now?
2016-05-04T13:44:22 <PaliwalSparsh> @cindyli Have we ever thought of shifting to gitter.
2016-05-04T13:45:05 <PaliwalSparsh> @jhung ^ same
2016-05-04T13:45:15 * kasparnet joined the channel
2016-05-04T13:46:03 <jhung> PaliwalSparsh: I had to google that. Interesting!
2016-05-04T13:46:27 <PaliwalSparsh> @jhung thanks
2016-05-04T13:46:41 <avtar> jhernand1z: building it at the moment and then uploading it to the cdn
2016-05-04T13:47:34 <jhernand1z> avtar: awesome
2016-05-04T13:47:35 <jhernand1z> :)
2016-05-04T13:48:13 <PaliwalSparsh> @cindyli @jhung I saw this article to see some of the possibilities with gitter, https://www.loomio.org/d/BqojmUEy/try-out-gitter-im-the-new-chat-for-github-users
2016-05-04T13:52:39 * michelled joined the channel

2016-05-04T14:03:55 <PaliwalSparsh> @cindyli we should give it a try it is awesome if you guys feel I can set it up it wont take much time just some clicks.
2016-05-04T14:10:51 <cindyli> PaliwalSparsh: seems gitter requires chatters to have github accounts, which some ppl may not have. using gitter or not probably needs a broader discussion. if you have time, you probably can come up with a draft that answers: 1. what are the target audience; 2. are you thinking to have gitter as an add-on of irc or a replacement; 3. pros and cons compare to other chat tools such as irc we are currently using, etc

2016-05-04T16:14:59 <jhernandez> shall we consider that issue as a blocker regarding the merge of the big pull request?
2016-05-04T16:15:37 <Bosmon> jhernandez - not really, I\'ve already rewritten the tests affected
2016-05-04T16:16:32 <jhernandez> Bosmon: ok, but you mean universal and windows, how about linux?

2016-05-04T16:30:28 <amatas> avtar, alanharnum https://github.com/gpii-ops/ansible-preferences-server-data-loader/blob/master/tasks/configure.yml#L1-L5
2016-05-04T16:31:39 <amatas> that task fails because it tries to copy the files from the host instead of the guest vm. I think is a bug between the version 1.8.2 and ansible 2.0
2016-05-04T16:32:39 <alanharnum> amatas: yeah, I remember it being necessary to store on the host temporarily, but i can\'t recall why offhand
2016-05-04T16:32:46 <amatas> I\'ve tried to use ansible_local as provisioner, but it also has a bug https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/issues/6793
2016-05-04T16:34:47 <amatas> alanharnum, the synchronize module gives a lot of issues if the connection between the master and the clients is "special" which is the case in vagrant environments.

2016-05-04T16:42:17 <avtar> amatas: regarding the ansible_local issues, it\'s probably safer/easier to use the vagrant shell provisioning method we\'ve been using so far to trigger ansible runs
2016-05-04T16:42:59 <avtar> unless using the ansible_local feature offers some feature(s) that need to be relied on
2016-05-04T16:43:07 <amatas> ok, will try with that
2016-05-04T16:45:12 <gtirloni_> the test data comes from the app repo, the copying to /tmp is just a convenience because the data will be reformatted. i wonder why that is failing.. is the copying from host to the vagrant VM not working? and if so, is it not working just for the prefsData?
2016-05-04T16:48:50 <amatas> gtirloni_, I will try to exec the playbook in the guest vm (instead of run it at the host), it should fix the problem because all the files are in the same vm.
2016-05-04T16:49:14 <gtirloni_> cool, i hope that works

2016-05-04T18:10:57 <avtar> clown, jhernandez: in order to use it with gpii/linux you\'ll need to edit your Vagrantfile https://github.com/GPII/linux/blob/master/Vagrantfile#L27 so that it reads \'inclusivedesign/fedora23\'
2016-05-04T18:11:20 <avtar> then "vagrant destroy -f && vagrant up" in your project directory
