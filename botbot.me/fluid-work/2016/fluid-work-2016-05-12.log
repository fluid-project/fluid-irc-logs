2016-05-12T18:50:11 <Justin_o> Bosmon, colinclark: just read through this javascript testing post that came up on the gpii architecture list http://www.sitepoint.com/javascript-testing-unit-functional-integration/
2016-05-12T18:51:00 <Justin_o> i\'m sort of feeling like we should split up our test files, as I believe we have mixed the unit, functional, and integration tests in some cases.
2016-05-12T18:51:56 <Justin_o> perhaps a timeline around the 2.0 release and seeing how it can integrate with the QI work and etc.
2016-05-12T18:52:00 <Justin_o> what do you guys think?
2016-05-12T18:52:41 <colinclark> what\'s the downside of having mixed them, Justin_o?
2016-05-12T18:52:52 <colinclark> My impression is that the distinction is never fully strict
2016-05-12T18:53:07 <colinclark> but do you think there\'s a performance beneft to separating out integration tests for Infusion?
2016-05-12T18:54:00 <michelled> I suppose if you are determine test coverage for the different types of tests then splitting them allows you to use tool to determine that
2016-05-12T18:54:17 <michelled> that should have been \'if you want to\xe2\x80\xa6."
2016-05-12T18:57:39 <Justin_o> one of the reasons they give if the post is that unit tests should be quick for direct feedback that you can run all the time.
2016-05-12T18:57:59 <Justin_o> and explain the different stages that different types of tests are best suited for.
2016-05-12T18:58:07 <Justin_o> these may or may not all apply to our work
2016-05-12T18:58:40 <Justin_o> i think one thing that could help is to simplify the tests files and make them easier to maintain

2016-05-12T20:09:16 <avtar> colinclark: correct on both counts
2016-05-12T20:09:26 <colinclark> avtar: and errors are posted here? http://lists.gpii.net/mailman/listinfo/ci
2016-05-12T20:09:35 <avtar> yup
2016-05-12T20:09:41 <colinclark> you\'re so great :)
2016-05-12T20:09:44 <colinclark> right, Bosmon?
2016-05-12T20:09:57 <avtar> you can use the ci-int.* urls to access the actual jenkins instances
2016-05-12T20:10:09 <colinclark> And is this the list for the Fluid-related builds? http://lists.idrc.ocad.ca/mailman/listinfo/builds
2016-05-12T20:10:13 <avtar> the ones you listed above are the static archives
2016-05-12T20:10:14 * gloob joined the channel
2016-05-12T20:10:46 <avtar> colinclark: yes
2016-05-12T20:10:59 <Bosmon> Well, this is great!
2016-05-12T20:11:09 <Bosmon> It looks like the mails are not coming out for the Infusion build
2016-05-12T20:11:28 <Bosmon> It seems we had 5 build failures in March, and there was no list traffic
2016-05-12T20:13:01 <avtar> Bosmon: hmm could you let me know what\'s listed under \'services\' when you visit https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/settings/hooks
2016-05-12T20:14:04 <Bosmon> It says - Email, and Jenkins
2016-05-12T20:14:22 <colinclark> neither of them have checkmarks though
2016-05-12T20:14:28 <colinclark> should we send a test request?
2016-05-12T20:14:32 <colinclark> oh wait
2016-05-12T20:14:33 <colinclark> they do now
2016-05-12T20:14:34 <Bosmon> I see checkmarks on both of them
2016-05-12T20:14:36 <colinclark> Github is just slow :)
2016-05-12T20:14:59 <Bosmon> I see a red triangle on the https://issues.fluidproject.org/GitHubPostCommit.jspa Webhook though
2016-05-12T20:17:31 <avtar> Bosmon, colinclark: could you please click the edit button for the \'jenkins (github plugin)\' service and tell me which jenkins hook url is shown?
2016-05-12T20:17:40 <colinclark> yes
2016-05-12T20:18:34 <colinclark> Can I paste it here, avtar?
2016-05-12T20:18:37 <colinclark> or elsewhere?
2016-05-12T20:18:50 <avtar> maybe message it to me
2016-05-12T20:19:22 <colinclark> done
2016-05-12T20:19:45 <avtar> colinclark: that doesn\'t look right at all o_O
2016-05-12T20:20:01 <avtar> just to confirm, that\'s in the jenkins hook url text field?
2016-05-12T20:20:07 <colinclark> no
2016-05-12T20:20:23 <colinclark> that\'s in the webhook that had the red triangle
2016-05-12T20:21:35 <avtar> i think the jenkins webhook url is probably the second service listed on that page
2016-05-12T20:22:55 <colinclark> ok, one sec

2016-05-12T21:02:47 <simonjb> hey Bosmon, I\'ve found an issue with latest Infusion and the Nexus
2016-05-12T21:03:05 <simonjb> I was testing Nexus today against the latest Kettle and Infusion
2016-05-12T21:04:26 <simonjb> the problem is that I cannot remove my model change listener at OnDestroy of the WebSocket
2016-05-12T21:04:48 <simonjb> I get "Cannot remove unregistered listener function"
2016-05-12T21:05:31 <simonjb> I\'ve traced the problem to fluid.event.identifyListener() in Fluid.js removeListener returning undefined
2016-05-12T21:06:08 <simonjb> and it looks like the change that causes me issues was introduced in https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/commit/290e34adcb5b7aeb10444ab634a12da3976f3502
2016-05-12T21:08:51 <avtar> Bosmon: disregard what i said earlier
2016-05-12T21:08:58 <avtar> i see the failed builds on the jenkins dashboard
2016-05-12T21:09:07 <simonjb> Bosmon: this is the call that is failing https://github.com/simonbates/nexus/blob/master/src/Nexus.js#L157L161
2016-05-12T21:23:21 * sepidehshahi has left the channel
2016-05-12T21:29:34 <Bosmon> simonjb - that\'s sort of right, yes
2016-05-12T21:29:38 <Bosmon> I mean, it is right
2016-05-12T21:29:42 <Bosmon> I mean, what you say is right
2016-05-12T21:29:48 <Bosmon> And the result is sort of right : p
2016-05-12T21:31:02 <Bosmon> Sadly in order to meet https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5695 , model listeners have to be identified in a slightly different way
2016-05-12T21:31:22 <Bosmon> Which has been at the expense of some of the regularity of the progammatic API, which is "not meant for ordinary users"
2016-05-12T21:31:48 <Bosmon> You will need to explicitly provide a "listenerId" at the point of registering the listener, which you can use to remove it again
2016-05-12T21:33:10 <Bosmon> simonjb - you can see an example of the required pattern here: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/tests/test-core/utils/js/IoCTestUtils.js#L394
2016-05-12T21:36:42 * michelled has quit
2016-05-12T21:37:42 <simonjb> ok thanks Bosmon -- so I would generate an id, set it in my addListener spec, and then use that when I remove?
2016-05-12T21:38:03 <Bosmon> simonjb - that\'s right
2016-05-12T21:38:18 <simonjb> great, thanks Bosmon, will try that out
2016-05-12T21:38:29 <Bosmon> I\'d welcome any ideas how to meet FLUID-5695 and still retain the old semantics, but I couldn\'t come up with any
2016-05-12T21:38:52 <Bosmon> Given the same function handle may appear at multiple places in the model, the system can no longer know which one you meant to remove
2016-05-12T21:39:07 <Bosmon> And it seems onerous, not to say a bit dangerous, to imagine you meant to remove all of them
2016-05-12T21:39:30 * gloob has quit
2016-05-12T21:39:37 <Bosmon> You can see that I ended up perverting the standard listener system, but not by very much
2016-05-12T21:39:42 * Justin_o has quit
2016-05-12T21:40:01 <Bosmon> In the "old old" framework there was an unpleasant interrelationship between the model event code and the standard event code
2016-05-12T21:40:19 <Bosmon> In the "old" framework they were separated completely, at the cost of quite a bit of code duplication between the two systems
2016-05-12T21:40:36 <Bosmon> Post FLUID-5695 the duplication was removed, but the semantics are not quite as straightforward as they used to be
2016-05-12T21:40:46 <simonjb> got it
2016-05-12T21:41:02 <simonjb> we should probably update https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/blob/master/src/documents/ChangeApplierAPI.md
2016-05-12T22:04:12 * jhernandez has quit
2016-05-12T22:07:45 <avtar> Bosmon, colinclark: we should see build failure notifications on the http://lists.idrc.ocad.ca/mailman/listinfo/builds list now
2016-05-12T22:08:16 <colinclark> awesome
2016-05-12T22:08:18 <colinclark> what was the issue?
2016-05-12T22:10:46 * danayo has quit
2016-05-12T22:11:56 <avtar> an email address used by jenkins had to be added in the list\'s mailman settings
2016-05-12T22:12:09 <colinclark> ouch, ok
2016-05-12T22:12:20 <colinclark> So I guess it should be a requirement of committership
2016-05-12T22:12:34 <colinclark> that we are subscribed to the appropriate lists?
2016-05-12T22:12:59 <avtar> that makes sense
2016-05-12T22:13:09 <avtar> i\'ll send an email to the arch and fluid-work list with those details
2016-05-12T22:26:01 <colinclark> thanks so much, avtar

b'2016-05-12T13:31:42 <amatas> kasparnet, sorry for the mess with the vms, but perhaps you should remove the old versions of the boxes. You can see the older boxes with the command: "vagrant box outdated"
2016-05-12T13:32:06 <amatas> in order to get some more disk space
2016-05-12T13:32:17 <amatas> https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/cli/box.html
2016-05-12T13:33:04 <kasparnet> hey amatas
2016-05-12T13:33:05 <amatas> then, with "vagrant box remove --box-version VERSION BOX_NAME" you can remove one specific version of the box
2016-05-12T13:33:10 <kasparnet> i figured it out now
2016-05-12T13:33:19 <kasparnet> just deleted some stuff, and got things up and running
2016-05-12T13:33:20 <amatas> awesome
2016-05-12T13:33:40 <kasparnet> so the tests i should run, is it there https://github.com/amatas/GPII-universal/tree/GPII-1781/examples/gpii-production-tests
2016-05-12T13:33:42 <kasparnet> these*
2016-05-12T13:33:57 <amatas> anyway you can use the above to clean your box list at any time.
2016-05-12T13:34:30 <amatas> yes kasparnet, it only takes your production tests https://github.com/amatas/GPII-universal/blob/GPII-1781/examples/gpii-production-tests/GPIIProductionTests.json#L19
2016-05-12T13:34:48 <amatas> and changes the preferences url: https://github.com/amatas/GPII-universal/blob/GPII-1781/examples/gpii-production-tests/GPIIProductionTests.json#L15

2016-05-12T13:42:14 * Yan_Hu has left the channel
2016-05-12T13:47:54 <kasparnet> ok, amatas
2016-05-12T13:48:02 <kasparnet> I can get it working if I change these two lines:
2016-05-12T13:48:03 <kasparnet> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/configs/production.with.logging.json#L15
2016-05-12T13:48:10 <kasparnet> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/configs/cloudBased.production.json#L15
2016-05-12T13:48:19 <kasparnet> to
2016-05-12T13:48:34 <kasparnet> "preferences": "http://server:8082/preferences/%userToken",
2016-05-12T13:48:49 <kasparnet> (ie. host and port changed to point to the other VM)
2016-05-12T13:48:58 <amatas> awesome
2016-05-12T13:48:59 <kasparnet> then running the normal production tests
2016-05-12T13:49:15 <kasparnet> is passing
2016-05-12T13:49:37 <kasparnet> only thing is that I manually had to run: vagrant provision fedora
2016-05-12T13:49:43 <kasparnet> before getting GPII available in there
2016-05-12T13:50:02 * colinclark joined the channel
2016-05-12T13:50:05 <kasparnet> (and then the URL change in the each of the configs)
2016-05-12T13:50:12 <kasparnet> then everything was working
2016-05-12T13:50:26 <amatas> how can I reproduce those testing steps
2016-05-12T13:55:11 * simonjb joined the channel
2016-05-12T13:55:17 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2016-05-12T13:55:49 <kasparnet> amatas: well - i basically just followed your instructions
2016-05-12T13:55:57 <kasparnet> so:
2016-05-12T13:56:07 <kasparnet> checked out this repo
2016-05-12T13:56:08 <amatas> :D
2016-05-12T13:56:08 <kasparnet> https://github.com/amatas/vagrant-gpii-server-client
2016-05-12T13:56:24 <kasparnet> screwed around with the updating stuff
2016-05-12T13:56:29 <kasparnet> but other than that just did a:
2016-05-12T13:56:31 <kasparnet> vagrant up
2016-05-12T13:56:40 <kasparnet> vagrant provision fedora
2016-05-12T13:57:02 <kasparnet> and then inside fedora box I went to the gpii/node_modules/universal folder
2016-05-12T13:57:07 <kasparnet> and did these changes
2016-05-12T13:57:13 <kasparnet> https://github.com/GPII/universal/compare/master...kaspermarkus:GPII-1781?expand=1
2016-05-12T13:57:28 <kasparnet> and then the production tests passed
2016-05-12T13:57:41 <amatas> I mean, did you run the all-tests.js script or the driver.js of https://github.com/amatas/GPII-universal/tree/GPII-1781/examples/gpii-production-tests
2016-05-12T13:58:02 <kasparnet> (ie. running "node tests/ProductionConfigTests.js" form universal)
2016-05-12T13:58:09 <amatas> ok
2016-05-12T13:58:17 <kasparnet> yeah - i didn\'t run your driver at all
2016-05-12T13:58:31 <kasparnet> so we want to run that instead?
2016-05-12T14:00:05 <amatas> I think, that is the next step. Bosmon said that its better to inherit from the original tests than make strings substitutions
2016-05-12T14:01:18 <kasparnet> yeah - that makes sense
2016-05-12T14:01:22 <kasparnet> let me just try that out
2016-05-12T14:02:35 <amatas> that is I was trying to do in my branch
2016-05-12T14:03:38 <Bosmon> kasparnet - so if you are just running the existing driver, you are just testing against the global preferences server again
2016-05-12T14:03:59 <Bosmon> Whereas amatas wants to test his own flowManager against his own preferences server vm
2016-05-12T14:14:20 <kasparnet> Bosmon: yeah - I did change the URL for the preferences server
2016-05-12T14:14:24 <kasparnet> to be the local one
2016-05-12T14:14:30 <Bosmon> ok
2016-05-12T14:14:32 <Bosmon> What happened
2016-05-12T14:14:36 <kasparnet> but it involved me actually modifying the config files
2016-05-12T14:14:41 <kasparnet> everything went well
2016-05-12T14:14:47 <kasparnet> but it wasn\'t using https
2016-05-12T14:14:50 <Bosmon> ok
2016-05-12T14:15:05 <Bosmon> Is it prohibitive to set up HTTPS inside the test VM?
2016-05-12T14:15:46 <kasparnet> as in: is it impossible/difficult, or does it break it?
2016-05-12T14:15:57 <kasparnet> "is it prohibitive"
2016-05-12T14:16:04 <kasparnet> you brits and your fancy english
2016-05-12T14:16:17 <kasparnet> well... you brits and colinclark, I guess :D
2016-05-12T14:16:24 <amatas> haha
2016-05-12T14:16:41 <colinclark> oooh
2016-05-12T14:16:50 <amatas> It is possible to have https in the test vms
2016-05-12T14:16:51 <colinclark> I get to them there fancy English too?
2016-05-12T14:18:00 <colinclark> it\'ll be great when we get these "whole infrastructure" tests in place
2016-05-12T14:18:07 <colinclark> amatas: I\'m excited you\'re working on it
2016-05-12T14:18:21 <amatas> :)
2016-05-12T14:18:40 <alanharnum> the biggest irritation with https in a VM is generally browser warnings etc about certificates
2016-05-12T14:18:55 <alanharnum> setting up https itself is not too hard
2016-05-12T14:19:39 <amatas> alanharnum, with the nginx-reverse roles is easy
2016-05-12T14:19:43 <amatas> ;)

2016-05-12T15:54:58 <Bosmon> alanharnum - I imagine we\'d not see any warnings given we are just using node\'s internal HTTPS client
2016-05-12T15:55:45 <alanharnum> Bosmon: possibly - it depends on what it does / doesn\'t do for certificate checking, and whether or not that can be changed
2016-05-12T15:56:05 <alanharnum> i used to run into issues with this with Java and HTTPS under similar circumstance
2016-05-12T15:57:58 * colinclark has quit
2016-05-12T15:59:21 <Bosmon> Yes
2016-05-12T15:59:25 <Bosmon> Java was horrible in this respect
2016-05-12T15:59:35 <Bosmon> To the extent that one would never bother to test with HTTPS
2016-05-12T15:59:41 <Bosmon> I\'m hoping node.js is better
2016-05-12T15:59:54 <amatas> Bosmon, alanharnum https://github.com/amatas/vagrant-gpii-server-client/commit/0ce6b0cf879718247902c60a0fc197bad910c58e
2016-05-12T16:00:04 * alanharnum remembers discovering Java did its entirely own thing with certificate authorities, etc etc.
2016-05-12T16:00:23 <alanharnum> also this: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce-7-download-432124.html
2016-05-12T16:00:30 <Bosmon> amatas - very nice
2016-05-12T16:00:32 <Bosmon> Does it work? : P
2016-05-12T16:00:56 <alanharnum> if i never have to manually copy Unlimited Strength JCE manually into place again i will be a happier, more fulfilled person
2016-05-12T16:01:06 <amatas> alanharnum, I\'ve added the certification authority in order to avoid warnings adding the ca file as a trust entity
2016-05-12T16:01:39 <alanharnum> amatas: handy
2016-05-12T16:01:40 <amatas> Bosmon, my clunky test curl https://server/preferences/MikelVargas works as expected :D

2016-05-12T10:53:48 <Bosmon> Hi there kasparnet
2016-05-12T10:53:54 <Bosmon> Thanks for your "show cause of bug" pull!
2016-05-12T10:54:03 <Bosmon> But you know what my question is going to be
2016-05-12T10:54:07 <Bosmon> "How did this ever work"?
2016-05-12T10:55:31 <Bosmon> The version of Kettle that trunk is bound to hasn\'t changed since you wrote those tests....
2016-05-12T10:56:42 <kasparnet> we only introduced https on the preferences server relatively recently
2016-05-12T10:57:22 <kasparnet> it was just http before
2016-05-12T10:57:27 <kasparnet> Bosmon: ^
2016-05-12T11:03:47 <Bosmon> kasparnet - gah
2016-05-12T11:03:58 <Bosmon> ok
2016-05-12T11:04:10 <Bosmon> And I assume that amatas was also using https in his demo vm
2016-05-12T11:04:38 <Bosmon> But still
2016-05-12T11:04:42 <Bosmon> It doesn\'t make any sense to me
2016-05-12T11:05:01 <Bosmon> If this change is needed in the architecture, how were we ever consuming https on the preferences server?
2016-05-12T11:06:53 <kasparnet> hmmmm... good point

2016-05-12T11:28:13 <kasparnet> background: we found an issue with the production tests failing due to https on the prefs server
2016-05-12T11:28:23 <kasparnet> and we were wondering how we ever used the preferences server

2016-05-12T11:28:54 * PaliwalSparsh joined the channel
2016-05-12T11:29:06 <kasparnet> hey amatas
2016-05-12T11:29:16 <PaliwalSparsh> Hi everyone
2016-05-12T11:29:16 <gtirloni> hi, i think https was always available? maybe 2-3 months ago we started redirecting http to https
2016-05-12T11:29:18 <gtirloni> what\'s the issue?
2016-05-12T11:30:10 <gtirloni> this is the earliest email i have where https was mentioned -- http://lists.gpii.net/pipermail/architecture/2016-January/003821.html
2016-05-12T11:30:16 <kasparnet> our GPII production tests are failing (and probably have been so for a while) due to https
2016-05-12T11:30:55 <kasparnet> and Bosmon and I were just a bit puzzled why we never encountered the issue before
2016-05-12T11:31:02 <PaliwalSparsh> Please can anyone tell me about the benefits of protected branches in github
2016-05-12T11:31:06 <amatas> https was introduced in january, and all the http requests are redirected to https since march aprox
2016-05-12T11:31:09 <gtirloni> but what\'s the issue? :)
2016-05-12T11:31:56 <Bosmon> gtirloni - the issue is that our tests don\'t run
2016-05-12T11:32:00 <kasparnet> oh - so the version of the code in the master branch(es) fails when getting the 301 redirect
2016-05-12T11:32:01 <amatas> gtirloni, it seems that the kettle server doesn\'t handle the https requests correctly
2016-05-12T11:32:18 <Bosmon> And I don\'t see how we have ever managed to consume the https preferences server
2016-05-12T11:32:19 <gtirloni> ok, is it not following the 301?
2016-05-12T11:32:22 <Bosmon> What clients does it have?
2016-05-12T11:32:24 <amatas> anyway kasparnet, the vagrant environment doesn\'t use https, have you tried the tests in there?
2016-05-12T11:32:31 <kasparnet> I guess we haven\'t, Bosmon
2016-05-12T11:32:44 <kasparnet> we probably always just used http
2016-05-12T11:32:52 * gloob has quit
2016-05-12T11:32:54 <Bosmon> Ok, so we just applied https to the preferences server without any evidence that it worked for anyone? : P
2016-05-12T11:33:11 <Bosmon> And left it that way for 4 months? : P
2016-05-12T11:33:15 <kasparnet> haha
2016-05-12T11:33:20 <kasparnet> that sounds about right
2016-05-12T11:33:25 <Bosmon> ok
2016-05-12T11:33:26 <Bosmon> Well
2016-05-12T11:33:27 <amatas> gtirloni, no, it doesn\'t follow the 301 status
2016-05-12T11:33:31 <Bosmon> "this was not our greatest hour"
2016-05-12T11:33:37 <Bosmon> To quote another honorable member of this channel
2016-05-12T11:34:40 <kasparnet> amatas: nope - didn\'t try the vagrant environment, but will try that now
2016-05-12T11:34:57 <Bosmon> I imagine the production tests suffer from multiple issues
2016-05-12T11:35:13 <kasparnet> making that changes though, they both pass
2016-05-12T11:35:17 <kasparnet> change*
2016-05-12T11:35:40 <Bosmon> !!
2016-05-12T11:36:14 <amatas> kasparnet, did you updated the vagrant box?
2016-05-12T11:36:20 <gtirloni> is that one a recent node version? i wonder why the http module (or whatever is used) is failing that basic feature
2016-05-12T11:37:11 <Bosmon> gtirloni - it is old node, but we have never bothered to load the "https" module
2016-05-12T11:37:36 <kasparnet> amatas: doing it right now
2016-05-12T11:39:56 <gtirloni> we can always remove the redirect, i antecipate there will be a lot of discussions around requiring https though.. giving all the PII/HIPAA discussions
2016-05-12T11:40:25 <kasparnet> well, I think we should support it, either way
2016-05-12T11:40:37 <kasparnet> and not allow access to the preferences server without ssl
2016-05-12T11:40:47 <kasparnet> so I think it\'s sensible the way it is now
2016-05-12T11:40:58 <kasparnet> .... it\'s just suprising we haven\'t run into this issue sooner
2016-05-12T11:41:43 <gtirloni> yeah, that\'s interesting. maybe the semi-prod / staging instances were only used during review4 (before the https redirect) and never again

2016-05-12T11:54:05 <kasparnet> Bosmon: so, I guess this needs to be fixed
2016-05-12T11:54:23 <kasparnet> ... the question is, will it automatically be fixed as part of the GPII-1318 work
2016-05-12T11:54:40 <kasparnet> or should I make a fix and pull request against your master?
2016-05-12T11:54:49 <kasparnet> your GPII-1318
2016-05-12T11:54:53 <kasparnet> i mean
2016-05-12T11:55:08 <kasparnet> or universal/master?
2016-05-12T11:59:21 <amatas> kasparnet, maybe you need to stop gpii-linux-framework in the fedora vm when you run the tests: "sudo systemctl stop gpii-linux-framework"
2016-05-12T11:59:41 * jhung joined the channel
2016-05-12T12:00:24 <amatas> I\'m still getting the 500 status error in my tests with the kettle patch :_(
2016-05-12T12:07:12 <Bosmon> kasparnet - we need to get these tests working first
2016-05-12T12:07:22 <Bosmon> And all the infrastructure they depend on
2016-05-12T12:07:34 <Bosmon> We can\'t upgrade trunk if we don\'t understand why it is broken

2016-05-12T12:24:47 <kasparnet> by just making sure we use http or https based on the protocol
2016-05-12T12:25:09 <kasparnet> I guess there is still a question of whether we should automatically follow a 301 redirect
2016-05-12T12:25:43 <kasparnet> ... in other words, what is it we dont understand is broken?
2016-05-12T12:26:02 <kasparnet> (ofc - we need to figure out things with amatas\' box as well)

2016-05-12T12:35:23 <Bosmon> Since this is the only environment in which they count as "tests"
2016-05-12T12:35:33 <kasparnet> ok - fair enough :)
2016-05-12T12:35:36 <Bosmon> Currently they just have the status of "some stuff we can run when we feel like it"
2016-05-12T12:35:37 <kasparnet> looking at it now
