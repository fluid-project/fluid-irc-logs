b'2016-08-17T16:57:44 <colinclark> no recommendations, just curious
2016-08-17T16:57:58 <colinclark> perhaps I can code vicariously through you? :)
2016-08-17T16:59:04 <gloob> sure
2016-08-17T16:59:11 <gloob> that would be awesome
2016-08-17T16:59:41 <gloob> well, there\'s in the horizon to the at on demand
2016-08-17T16:59:48 <gloob> a prototype could make sense too
2016-08-17T16:59:53 <gloob> to craft some ideas
2016-08-17T17:00:10 <gloob> because everyday I\'m more sure that we are going to implement something by ourselves
2016-08-17T17:00:20 <gloob> although is something that stegru is going to help too
2016-08-17T17:01:00 <gloob> but the most helpful will be in the macOS side a lot of to explore and implement

2016-08-17T17:38:47 <TPark_> danayo: okay, thanks
2016-08-17T17:48:41 <cindyli> gtirloni: in the vm that avtar gave for setting up GPII in the production mode. the code of importing the preferences data is commented out to speed up "vagrant up". now i need to uncomment the code. do you know where it is?
2016-08-17T17:49:11 <cindyli> i believe the upload was done here - https://github.com/gpii-ops/ansible-preferences-server-data-loader/blob/master/tasks/deploy.yml#L22
2016-08-17T17:49:51 <cindyli> it\'s not commented. do you know where is calling this upload, gtirloni?
2016-08-17T17:54:14 <alanharnum> colinclark Justin_o (& others): here\'s a proposed /dist structure for making more friendly structures for people to use Infusion after an \'npm install\': https://gist.github.com/waharnum/4d1f3845ce6b8dc7ed6d4c9dcd23f69e
2016-08-17T17:54:19 <alanharnum> that\'s just some initial thinking
2016-08-17T17:55:01 <danayo> TPark: we are done the meeting
2016-08-17T17:55:07 <alanharnum> if we\'re on the same page about that as a solution Justin_o & I can think about how long that would take

2016-08-17T19:19:24 <cindyli> gtirloni: yes, this is where the vm lives - https://github.com/avtar/universal/tree/GPII-1821/examples/production-components-vm
2016-08-17T19:20:01 * PaliwalSparsh has quit
2016-08-17T19:25:55 <gtirloni> cindyli: it doesn\'t seem to be commented.. the data loader role should be running -- https://github.com/avtar/universal/blob/GPII-1821/examples/production-components-vm/provisioning/preferences-server.yml#L13
2016-08-17T19:26:42 <gtirloni> cindyli: is it not returning any of the test data?
2016-08-17T19:27:16 <cindyli> that\'s true, i can see in the couchdb that the "preferences" database is created but empty
2016-08-17T19:28:16 <gtirloni> maybe avtar commented some code only on your computer?
2016-08-17T19:28:34 <cindyli> avtar and I talked before he went on vacation and decided to disabled the data loading since that takes a good amount of time. But now I\'m lost on where the disabling is ;)
2016-08-17T19:29:02 <cindyli> he was working on his computer and all changes should be included in his branch
2016-08-17T19:29:32 <gtirloni> cindyli: if so, that\'s probably inside provisioning/roles/ansible-preferences-server-data-loader/tasks/deploy.yml
2016-08-17T19:30:34 <gtirloni> cindyli: the production repo points to github.com/gpii-ops/* and it\'s not commented out there (it\'s using the \'master\' branch for the data loader role)
2016-08-17T19:30:38 <cindyli> i\'m now thinking the data loading might be caused by some other issues. the vm hasn\'t been able to automatically start the prefs server and flow manger. it hits some errors in the middle. I, or we, should probably look at those errors first
2016-08-17T19:31:07 <gtirloni> cindyli: sure, i can take a look at those errors
2016-08-17T19:31:29 <gtirloni> cindyli: i\'ll setup my environment to use that repository here. i have never used it before
2016-08-17T19:31:33 <cindyli> the vm spin-up stops when hitting those errors. but since the couch dbs are created so i just went ahead with manually starting the prefs server and flow manager
2016-08-17T19:31:42 <cindyli> thanks, gtirloni.

2016-08-17T19:57:54 <gtirloni> cindyli: in the meantime, if you want to load the preferences manually, go to the prefData directory and run `for i in `ls *.json\'; do kanso upload $i http://localhost:5984/preferences; done`
2016-08-17T19:58:01 <gtirloni> cindyli: this *should* load them
2016-08-17T19:59:11 <cindyli> gtirloni: i think those json files need some conversion to be wrapped up into couchdb acceptable data format. this conversion is done by an ansible role as well
2016-08-17T20:00:32 <gtirloni> cindyli: you\'re right... i missed it because it\'s in the \'install\' phase and i was looking at the \'deploy\' phase in this ansible role. sorry
2016-08-17T20:01:32 <cindyli> np. it IS a bit confusing with scattered steps ;)

b'2016-08-17T15:15:28 <colinclark> obviously, Infusion itself is sourced by npm if someone "npm install"ed his app

2016-08-17T15:15:50 <danayo> Justin_o, jhung, PaliwalSparsh I\'m going to move our game design discussion to the fluid-design channel, lots of traffic here :)
2016-08-17T15:16:20 <colinclark> sorry, danayo
2016-08-17T15:16:24 <colinclark> I didn\'t mean to talk too much here
2016-08-17T15:16:29 <colinclark> :)
2016-08-17T15:16:36 <danayo> no worries colinclark!
2016-08-17T15:16:54 <danayo> it\'s a design discussion, so it makes sense anyway
2016-08-17T15:17:15 <sepidehshahi> Hi danayo, I was talking with TPark and godfrey_ about what they can do with the examples that they have created. I was suggesting coming up with an activity for the guides. So with this activity, anyone can come up with such examples related to their field.
2016-08-17T15:17:33 <danayo> that sounds great sepidehshahi
2016-08-17T15:17:35 <danayo> thanks
2016-08-17T15:18:00 <sepidehshahi> also I was suggesting that they document their process and current examples on the Fluid Wiki as a child page for the inclusive design guide. What do you think? is that the right place for it?
2016-08-17T15:18:07 <alanharnum> colinclark Justin_o: it may be worth seriously looking at some of the more recent front-end dependency tools that integrates with NPM
2016-08-17T15:18:12 <alanharnum> browserify, webpack, etc
2016-08-17T15:18:24 <sepidehshahi> danayo: ^
2016-08-17T15:18:32 <danayo> the more practical examples we can amass, the better sepidehshahi, TPark, godfrey_
2016-08-17T15:18:34 <alanharnum> and understanding why Infusion doesn\'t play well with those as currently structured, & what it would take to change that
2016-08-17T15:19:06 <danayo> and documenting on the wiki also sounds great sepidehshahi, TPark, godfrey_  - and I think that\'s the right place
2016-08-17T15:19:21 <sepidehshahi> great! thanks danayo.
2016-08-17T15:19:25 <colinclark> alanharnum: It is definitely worth looking into browserify or equivalent
2016-08-17T15:19:32 <colinclark> but how about not for this release? :)
2016-08-17T15:19:39 <alanharnum> i think not for this release, yes :p
2016-08-17T15:19:43 <colinclark> ok, perfect
2016-08-17T15:19:56 <colinclark> we definitely, definitely need to look at browserify and webpack and the like
2016-08-17T15:19:58 <godfrey_> sepidehshahi, danayo: awesome! we will keep you up to date on our progress
2016-08-17T15:20:10 <danayo> excellent, thanks godfrey_
2016-08-17T15:20:20 <sepidehshahi> thanks godfrey_
2016-08-17T15:20:46 <alanharnum> colinclark: that said, if you\'re proposing that we do the non-browserify things instead, i don\'t think those are going to take minimal time either
2016-08-17T15:20:59 <alanharnum> so it might be best to just leave it
2016-08-17T15:21:25 <alanharnum> per my comment at https://github.com/fluid-project/myl3/pull/1/files/460802a7d6ce2215e7c7d8a67d2231e9657005a0#r75114980, I can just build and concat my own custom version of Infusion like you do for Flocking
2016-08-17T15:21:38 <colinclark> I was going to leave Justin_o to consider how much time it might take
2016-08-17T15:21:48 <colinclark> since presumably he\'s the one who would have to do the work :)
2016-08-17T15:22:27 <alanharnum> i might be able to put some cycles on it as well
2016-08-17T15:22:50 <alanharnum> again, per my comment there - if we don\'t want all my various front-end projects to be dumping Infusion into my repo directly, but managing it through npm
2016-08-17T15:23:14 <alanharnum> either i need Infusion\'s build processes to accomodate that better, or I end up writing a reasonably complex installer in Grunt or some other means on my end
2016-08-17T15:25:16 <colinclark> yes, it\'s true
2016-08-17T15:28:28 <Justin_o> colinclark, alanharnum: probably not a trivial amount of work as the build process currently isn\'t setup to do multiple build types at once
2016-08-17T15:29:42 <colinclark> I\'m of two minds here, as I said
2016-08-17T15:29:54 <colinclark> it\'s not a particularly good use of alanharnum\'s time to have to roll some custom Grunt infrastructure
2016-08-17T15:30:08 <colinclark> and it would benefit many non-Node.js Infusion users
2016-08-17T15:30:14 <colinclark> HOWEVER, as you\'ve both also mentioned
2016-08-17T15:30:16 <colinclark> non-trivial
2016-08-17T15:30:34 <colinclark> and michelled and Bosmon have both encouraged us to just SHIP IT
2016-08-17T15:31:36 <colinclark> Justin_o: Is it something you could look at briefly and estimate?
2016-08-17T15:31:46 <colinclark> and then we can make a call?
2016-08-17T15:31:55 <colinclark> or you and alanharnum could estimate it

2016-08-17T15:54:00 <kavya> Hi Colin..
2016-08-17T15:54:26 <kavya> Is this the wiki page you were referring to https://wiki.gpii.net/w/QA_Testing
2016-08-17T15:55:21 <colinclark> Hi kavya, how\'s it going?
2016-08-17T15:55:52 <kavya> good :)
2016-08-17T15:55:56 <colinclark> if you use my full nick in IRC, it will cause me to get a notification, so I\'ll see it more quickly
2016-08-17T15:55:58 <colinclark> so if you do this:
2016-08-17T15:56:03 <colinclark> colinclark: hi!
2016-08-17T15:56:17 <colinclark> My IRC client will bounce to let me know you\'re pinging me
2016-08-17T15:56:29 <colinclark> anyway, no, that wasn\'t the page I was referring to
2016-08-17T15:56:37 <colinclark> but it is the page we should start to update and use
2016-08-17T15:56:40 <kavya> ok..
2016-08-17T15:57:17 <colinclark> I mentioned on the call today that there are some good examples from the Fluid and CollectionSpace projects
2016-08-17T15:57:29 <colinclark> on CollectionSpace, our own kasparnet was the QA Lead for the project
2016-08-17T15:57:38 <colinclark> and he did some very great work in terms of how to do open source QA
2016-08-17T15:57:46 <gloob> what is collectionspace?
2016-08-17T15:58:07 <colinclark> gloob: http://www.collectionspace.org/
2016-08-17T15:58:28 <colinclark> A museum collections management system that we built with kasparnet and some people from Cambridge and Berkeley
2016-08-17T15:58:43 <colinclark> it is used by a number of museums around the world
2016-08-17T15:58:47 <gloob> great, thanks
2016-08-17T15:58:55 <gloob> with nuxeo
2016-08-17T15:59:02 <colinclark> umm, yes
2016-08-17T15:59:18 <colinclark> kavya: You should also meet Justin_o, who is Justiin Obara. He works with us at the IDRC in Toronto
2016-08-17T15:59:28 <gloob> interesting
2016-08-17T15:59:35 <colinclark> he knows a ton about open source QA testing, and built all the test plans for Fluid
2016-08-17T15:59:59 <colinclark> Justin_o or michelled, do you have pointers for kavya of wiki pages describing test plans and the like?
2016-08-17T16:00:01 <kavya> ok..i should talk to him
2016-08-17T16:00:15 <colinclark> kasparnet: you probably have links to the collectionspace test plans, right?
2016-08-17T16:00:17 <gloob> and I guess that finally all the consolidation should go here https://wiki.gpii.net/w/QA_Testing
2016-08-17T16:00:20 <gloob> no?
2016-08-17T16:00:23 <colinclark> yes, definitely
2016-08-17T16:00:43 <gloob> kavya: I think you can refactor almost all the content in https://wiki.gpii.net/w/QA_Testing
2016-08-17T16:00:47 <colinclark> My sense is that this page should be refactored to be a kind of "dashboard" or landing page for information about QA testing
2016-08-17T16:00:49 <gloob> s/refactor/destroy
2016-08-17T16:00:55 <gloob> yepes
2016-08-17T16:00:57 <colinclark> ha :)
2016-08-17T16:01:10 <colinclark> and if there is any use for any of the test plan on this page, we can create a sub-page that clearly describes what it is
2016-08-17T16:02:04 <kavya> Do we have any testplans for fluid
2016-08-17T16:03:10 <michelled> here\'s an example of a fluid test plan: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Keyboard+Accessibility+QA+Test+Plan
2016-08-17T16:03:17 <michelled> it\'s for a single component
2016-08-17T16:03:36 <michelled> Justin_o: really should respond since he\'s the one who made the plans and refined the process
2016-08-17T16:06:59 <kavya> Thanks mitchelle..
2016-08-17T16:07:51 <kavya> gloob..info should be refactored a lot
2016-08-17T16:08:09 <gloob> that\'s the reason I think is better to start from scratch
2016-08-17T16:08:17 <gloob> using the good pointers supplied by colinclark
2016-08-17T16:08:28 <colinclark> yup
2016-08-17T16:08:31 <gloob> and define some kind of global approach of qa for gpii

2016-08-17T16:28:49 <kavya> anything realted to qa which helps me to do more QA
2016-08-17T16:29:59 <kavya> More robust QA :)
2016-08-17T16:31:58 <kavya> more specific to open source QA
2016-08-17T16:33:49 <gloob> well, IMO besides what colinclark said I suggest to make two lists, one with what we have currently
2016-08-17T16:34:01 <gloob> and other one with what we want to add prioritized
2016-08-17T16:34:21 <gloob> in the first lists you need to split in systems or components, we have a lot of differents beasts in gpii
2016-08-17T16:34:21 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2016-08-17T16:34:30 <gloob> we have universal, that have a complex architecture
2016-08-17T16:34:51 <gloob> that now AFAIK is being tested by the personas profiles and problably some unit testings, that I\'m not sure
2016-08-17T16:35:03 <gloob> something worth to check and document :)
2016-08-17T16:35:27 <gloob> we have the current platform implementations, mainly windows / linux and mac
2016-08-17T16:35:42 <gloob> they need their own testing needs
2016-08-17T16:36:40 <gloob> also we need a global QA process OSS oriented, that probably you can rip it off from the fluid
2016-08-17T16:36:55 <gloob> with that you have work for two months ;)
2016-08-17T16:37:11 <kavya> Yes..:)
2016-08-17T16:37:25 <colinclark> hahaha
2016-08-17T16:37:25 <colinclark> yes
2016-08-17T16:37:31 <colinclark> use the channel and the wiki as much as possible
2016-08-17T16:37:51 <colinclark> ask lots of questions\xe2\x80\x94never worry about bugging people and there are no bad questions
2016-08-17T16:37:55 <gloob> kavya: yes, I think any ideas is going to be welcomed, probably also check some similar projects will help
2016-08-17T16:38:02 <colinclark> start testing as soon as possible, even simple things
2016-08-17T16:38:13 <colinclark> then try to automate them so we can all run the QA tests you\'ve created while we\'re developing
2016-08-17T16:38:29 <gloob> exactly, you need to learn all the architecture
2016-08-17T16:38:35 <colinclark> The closest neighbours we have to QA tests, currently, are our acceptance tests
2016-08-17T16:38:47 <kavya> as of  now am i am working  on core1 testing..
2016-08-17T16:38:48 <colinclark> so make sure you can easily get the system up and running using vagrant and try out our tests
2016-08-17T16:38:52 <colinclark> and watch them fail on windows :)
2016-08-17T16:39:50 <kavya> Once i have what to test on core1.. i can start testing and simultaneously work on testplan
2016-08-17T16:40:12 <gloob> good
2016-08-17T16:40:28 <kavya> thanks colin..
2016-08-17T16:40:41 <colinclark> thank you, kavya!
2016-08-17T16:40:48 <colinclark> I\'m really happy you\'re on the team
2016-08-17T16:40:55 <colinclark> and starting to tackle the tough QA problems
2016-08-17T16:43:21 <gloob> kavya: yw :(
2016-08-17T16:44:01 <kavya> thanks again..am happy to be part of great and supportive team
2016-08-17T16:44:13 <kavya> what is yw?

2016-08-17T16:45:12 <kavya> hahah...thanks a lot gloob :)
2016-08-17T16:45:41 <gloob> now I feel better, thanks guys
2016-08-17T16:55:20 <colinclark> gloob: What are you hacking on these days?
2016-08-17T16:56:01 <gloob> colinclark: I\'m starting to add the suggestions from Bosmon7 in the two windows PR
2016-08-17T16:56:10 <gloob> after that I would like to move to mac again
2016-08-17T16:57:27 <gloob> colinclark: why? any recommendation? :)
2016-08-17T16:57:40 <colinclark> oh cool

2016-08-17T12:46:16 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: hello
2016-08-17T12:47:03 <PaliwalSparsh> Justin_o: I managed to fix all the bugs except the one with the key decision of selection interaction keys
2016-08-17T12:47:32 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: that was fast to fix those other issues, that\'s great
2016-08-17T12:47:55 <Justin_o> Did you have a question about the keys?
2016-08-17T12:48:25 <PaliwalSparsh> Justin_o: Thanks, yes i need some help
2016-08-17T12:48:55 <PaliwalSparsh> actually i have change language selection using arrow keys now instead of TAB and SHIFT + TAB
2016-08-17T12:49:11 <PaliwalSparsh> so game is totally TAB independent
2016-08-17T12:49:19 <Justin_o> ah cool, that\'s good
2016-08-17T12:49:33 <Justin_o> are you still using the \'q\' and \'w\' keys for the backpack?
2016-08-17T12:49:49 <PaliwalSparsh> Exactly what should i change them to I dont know.\\

2016-08-17T13:10:43 <Bosmon7> Hi there gloob - do you have time to make a few tweaks to your https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/79 pull?
2016-08-17T13:11:11 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: sorry, missed your last message
2016-08-17T13:12:53 <PaliwalSparsh> No issues Justin_o
2016-08-17T13:12:56 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: hmm.. I thought we had something written for that, but can\'t see it in the google doc now
2016-08-17T13:13:44 <PaliwalSparsh> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ae8w8hVUkNkV2RYgvnQmESa3yLjv7rwSO8IPreVhv2Q/edit?usp=sharing
2016-08-17T13:14:00 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: I believe we talked about either using a hot key like numbers or letters to toggle each setting. E.g. 1 toggles background music 2 toggles text to speech, etc. or using the tab key and enter to move through the backpack
2016-08-17T13:14:45 <Justin_o> i think dana will probably be online in a 15 to 45 minutes if you want to bring her in on this
2016-08-17T13:14:50 <Justin_o> she may remember something I have missed
2016-08-17T13:14:56 <PaliwalSparsh> <Justin_o> i think dana will probably be online in a 15 to 45 minutes if you want to bring her in on this
2016-08-17T13:15:07 <PaliwalSparsh> use arrow to move through languages? (consistent with other pages) - but would not be able to provide instruction because we don\xe2\x80\x99t have language selected yet - this may be more intuitive than using tab
2016-08-17T13:15:15 <PaliwalSparsh> This is what was stated in the doc
2016-08-17T13:15:49 <PaliwalSparsh> Justin_o surely I will ask danayo about it.
2016-08-17T13:16:22 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: yes, that was specific to the language selection i believe
2016-08-17T13:18:12 <PaliwalSparsh> Justin_o: We can always map them to numbers in the keyboard. But I dont know it would be a good option.
2016-08-17T13:18:21 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: the thing with using tab in the backpack is that you\'ll probably want the "enter" key to toggle the option and not affect the game in the main window when focus is on an item in the backpack. Additionally you\'ll still need to be able to exit the game with the keyboard and not have key commands trapped within it
2016-08-17T13:18:37 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: the numbers are not ideal
2016-08-17T13:21:02 <PaliwalSparsh> Justin_o: We left discussion abt it around this point only I guess. We can wait for dana and have discussion then.\\
2016-08-17T13:22:43 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: sounds good
2016-08-17T13:22:50 <PaliwalSparsh> :)

2016-08-17T14:22:18 <danayo> thanks Justin_o, I was just reading the log
2016-08-17T14:23:38 * colinclark joined the channel
2016-08-17T14:32:15 <danayo> Justin_o PaliwalSparsh: I don\'t think we came to any resolution yesterday about keyboard controls for the backpack
2016-08-17T14:33:19 <danayo> I wasn\'t too excited about using numbers and labelling etc
2016-08-17T14:33:30 <danayo> it seems like it might be a bit clunky
2016-08-17T14:33:58 <danayo> and we can\'t use the Enter key to select items in the backpack, since Enter is used to enter rooms, pick items up etc
2016-08-17T14:34:20 <danayo> perhaps we could use tab and space bar to select Justin_o, PaliwalSparsh ?
2016-08-17T14:35:45 * kavya joined the channel
2016-08-17T14:36:13 <danayo> tab to navigate through the pack, that is, and enter to toggle
2016-08-17T14:36:28 <danayo> argh, sorrry SPACE BAR to toggle!
2016-08-17T14:38:50 <Justin_o> danayo: space and enter tend to be treated synonymously in lots of interactions, so it may be confusing for the toggling if they act differently
2016-08-17T14:42:35 <danayo> that\'s true Justin_o. I really don\'t mind the hot keys (e.g. q and w) - I wonder though if we could choose different hot keys that might be more common? Like maybe something like J and L to navigate, and K to select? I\'m trying to think of more common game control keys
2016-08-17T14:51:00 <Justin_o> danayo: sorry, was in a meeting
2016-08-17T14:51:11 * the-t-in-rtf has quit
2016-08-17T14:51:18 <Justin_o> jhung: ^^
2016-08-17T14:51:29 * the-t-in-rtf joined the channel
2016-08-17T14:51:37 <Justin_o> danayo: games would probably use enter and space i think
2016-08-17T14:54:15 <Justin_o> danayo: maybe we should just use the tab and enter
2016-08-17T14:54:27 <Justin_o> and that the game area would need focus for the enter key to work in there
2016-08-17T14:55:16 <Justin_o> and to fix the tab keyboard trap, we should just push focus to the body or some other element in the markup
2016-08-17T14:55:55 <colinclark> Justin_o, michelled: There\'s a part of me that thinks addressing Infusion\'s build process might be worthwhile for 2.0
2016-08-17T14:56:10 <colinclark> but the other part of me is highly resistant to adding ANY new scope
2016-08-17T14:56:27 <danayo> oh i see Justin_o, so tabbing would move focus through the back pack, then to the game area, then back to backpack?
2016-08-17T14:56:31 <Justin_o> colinclark: i\'m not opposed to that.. how extensive of a fix were you thinking? the full change?
2016-08-17T14:56:37 <colinclark> but alanharnum raises some key points that are systemic for users of Infusion, in regards to our build process: https://github.com/fluid-project/myl3/pull/1/files/460802a7d6ce2215e7c7d8a67d2231e9657005a0#r75114980
2016-08-17T14:56:45 <jhung> danayo: Perhaps make the backpack modal - so you can use arrow keys to navigate between items and then ESC to close the backpack? Or map items in the backpack to numbers. 1 for option 1, etc....
2016-08-17T14:57:20 <colinclark> Justin_o: I think we probably need to get to the point where our build process is amenable to building a set of basic "distribution" versions of Infusion
2016-08-17T14:57:31 <colinclark> which ship as part of the npm module
2016-08-17T14:57:35 <danayo> i think we\'re using ESC to exit the game altogether Justin_o
2016-08-17T14:57:48 <colinclark> at least, a build of everything and of only the framework
2016-08-17T14:58:01 <colinclark> arguably, perhaps, builds of the individual components, sans framework
2016-08-17T14:58:02 <Justin_o> colinclark: if it\'s just for npm is there a way to do a pre-publish task.. or maybe it could be something we build into the fluid-publish module
2016-08-17T14:58:06 <colinclark> so that someone could grab a handful of files
2016-08-17T14:58:54 <colinclark> Justin_o: I think an npm prepublish script could do what we need
2016-08-17T14:59:12 <colinclark> assuming the build scripts can be refactored to build the appropriate files and place them accordingly
2016-08-17T14:59:17 <alanharnum> colinclark: I was talking to Justin_o about this yesterday and said I felt the minimum for a /dist would be something like the: full version all, minified version all, full version minus jquery, minified version minus jquery
2016-08-17T14:59:48 <alanharnum> probably, as you say, also minified/full versions of the framework-only code, with/without jquery
2016-08-17T15:00:23 <alanharnum> I also think generating concatenated versions of the components + their assets (CSS + images) in separate directories would be valuable
2016-08-17T15:02:04 <colinclark> I believe the typical pattern is to ship uniminified files
2016-08-17T15:02:14 <colinclark> and leave it to the implementer to take care of minification
2016-08-17T15:02:16 <colinclark> so we need not ship those
2016-08-17T15:03:41 <Justin_o> colinclark, alanharnum: how does this affect users builds downstream though. That is say in alanharnum\'s repo he wants to use Infusion in a web app... he needs to either reference infusion from node_modules, or move them to an appropriate place, but how does his app get published for use with the infusion dependency?
2016-08-17T15:03:44 <danayo> sorry jhung, just realised that was your comment above - we\'re using ESC to exit the game altogether
2016-08-17T15:04:04 <colinclark> I\'m not sure I understand, Justin_o
2016-08-17T15:04:08 <colinclark> can you elaborate your question?
2016-08-17T15:04:12 <colinclark> I\'m probably just being dense
2016-08-17T15:04:37 <Justin_o> danayo: I wasn\'t sure if PaliwalSparsh implemented that.
2016-08-17T15:06:26 <Justin_o> colinclark: yah, i\'m having trouble explaining it too.. so basically.. if i pull down alanharnum\'s repo where does the infusion dependency come from.. is it committed into his repo is it from npm.. and if i get it from an npm package how does the dependency come through.. does that make more sense
2016-08-17T15:06:37 <jhung> danayo: it doesn\'t have to ESC, it could be an explicit close button / option in the backpack.
2016-08-17T15:08:01 <colinclark> Justin_o: I think we want a world where we can recommend that users get Infusion via npm
2016-08-17T15:08:31 <colinclark> and that they can use a set of pre-built files and integrate them into their own build processes as necessary
2016-08-17T15:08:44 <colinclark> So perhaps we ship four categories of files
2016-08-17T15:08:54 <colinclark> 1. All of Infusion
2016-08-17T15:08:59 <colinclark> 2. Only the framework
2016-08-17T15:09:12 <colinclark> 3. Like #2, but without jQuery and other popular dependencies
2016-08-17T15:09:43 <colinclark> 4. One built file per component, excluding anything contained in #2
2016-08-17T15:10:19 <colinclark> and at that point, someone like alanharnum (or me with Flocking) could pick their preferred version of #1, 2, or 3, and then choose amongst the various #4s based on what components they use (if any)
2016-08-17T15:10:41 <alanharnum> that would be my ideal world
2016-08-17T15:10:45 <alanharnum> as that\'s basically what i do right now
2016-08-17T15:10:48 <colinclark> So the worst case experience is someone who uses lots of components, but not all of them, who will need ot build together a bunch of Infusion-related files
2016-08-17T15:11:15 <alanharnum> but the limitations of the build process require me (ATM) to basically dump the version of Infusion + components I want to use into my repo
2016-08-17T15:11:22 <colinclark> yes
2016-08-17T15:11:28 <colinclark> or, alanharnum, do what I do
2016-08-17T15:11:29 <colinclark> which sucks
2016-08-17T15:11:31 <colinclark> Here\'s what I do: https://github.com/colinbdclark/Flocking/blob/master/Gruntfile.js#L7-L96
2016-08-17T15:11:41 <colinclark> I make my own Infusion builds from scratch
2016-08-17T15:11:45 <colinclark> largely by trial and error :)
2016-08-17T15:11:56 <alanharnum> yes, i\'d like to avoid having to do that :p
2016-08-17T15:12:01 <colinclark> me too, alanharnum
2016-08-17T15:12:10 <colinclark> I looked at updating the build scripts in this direction a while ago
2016-08-17T15:12:14 <colinclark> and it was pretty tangled
2016-08-17T15:12:16 <colinclark> but looked doable
2016-08-17T15:13:16 <Justin_o> colinclark, alanharnum: my question is what happens for a user of alanharnum\'s repo
2016-08-17T15:13:20 <Justin_o> in regards to the infusion dependency
2016-08-17T15:13:50 <colinclark> That\'s a good question, Justin_o
2016-08-17T15:13:58 <colinclark> And I think the answer is something like this
2016-08-17T15:14:42 <colinclark> alanharnum\'s app will presumably follow a similar process to Infusion, or to, well, anything else
2016-08-17T15:15:02 <colinclark> He\'ll build up his dependencies into one or more convenient "distribution" files
2016-08-17T15:15:08 <colinclark> and people can consume that accordingly
