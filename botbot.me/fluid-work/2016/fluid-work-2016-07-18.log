b'2016-07-18T17:25:00 <gtirloni> jhung: is that because of friendly URLs?
2016-07-18T17:25:10 <avtar> colinclark: https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/statuses/#create-a-status
2016-07-18T17:25:11 <jhung> colinclark: if the tabs go directly to the first content page, attempting to load the index.html should do\xe2\x80\xa6?
2016-07-18T17:25:44 <avtar> looks like the bot will need some push access
2016-07-18T17:25:46 <avtar> "Note that the repo:status OAuth scope grants targeted access to Statuses without also granting access to repository code, while the repo scope grants permission to code as well as statuses."
2016-07-18T17:25:47 <colinclark> ok
2016-07-18T17:25:48 <jhung> keep the redirect? probably now. So maybe we\'ll still need a landing page.
2016-07-18T17:25:53 <colinclark> avtar: I don\'t love it
2016-07-18T17:25:57 <colinclark> jhung: Yes, that\'s fine
2016-07-18T17:26:03 <avtar> colinclark: understandable :)
2016-07-18T17:26:09 <colinclark> presumably those links will never actually be exposed to the world
2016-07-18T17:26:18 <colinclark> and thus could only be accessible by someone hacking the URL space, which is fine
2016-07-18T17:26:56 <colinclark> avtar: So what\'s your recommendation...
2016-07-18T17:26:59 <jhung> colinclark: thanks. I\'ll make the changes now danayo michelled
2016-07-18T17:27:08 <colinclark> set the bot\'s privileges on the org or on each appropriate repository?
2016-07-18T17:27:15 <colinclark> I guess probably the latter, avtar?
2016-07-18T17:27:18 <colinclark> cool jhung
2016-07-18T17:27:25 * wale joined the channel
2016-07-18T17:27:38 <michelled> thx jhung!
2016-07-18T17:27:48 <danayo> great jhung, wasn\'t sure what you meant about attempting to load index.html
2016-07-18T17:28:00 <avtar> i suggest we add the account with the necessary privileges to each of the repos, let the ci build queue settle down (there are 6 jobs remaining), and then trigger a few more after that
2016-07-18T17:28:05 <avtar> colinclark: ^
2016-07-18T17:28:16 <colinclark> avtar: seems reasonable
2016-07-18T17:28:52 <colinclark> avtar: It seems the Github UI has decided to invite the gpii-bot as a collaborator
2016-07-18T17:29:17 <colinclark> so currently it says, for the universal repository, that it is "Awaiting gpii-bot\'s response"
2016-07-18T17:29:30 <colinclark> smart though the bot is, presumably it doesn\'t actually have an email account :P
2016-07-18T17:29:33 <colinclark> maybe it does
2016-07-18T17:29:50 <colinclark> Is there anything else I need to do?
2016-07-18T17:30:29 <jhung> danayo: index.html is the default page that\'s loaded if someone tries to load an URL without a specific html file. In the case of the Guide, we don\'t have index pages, rather the user jumps directly to a content page. The rediect was there to mimic this behaviour, but as colin brought up, it creates some complications. So I\'m going to fix the navigation now to load the content page directly instead of loading a non-existant index.

2016-07-18T17:50:05 <colinclark> are there any other repositories it should have collaborator access to?
2016-07-18T17:51:42 <avtar> no, those should be it
2016-07-18T17:51:55 <avtar> i\'ll need to change the nexus one because we\'re still using simon\'s account https://github.com/GPII/ci-service/blob/master/jenkins_jobs/nexus.yml#L18

2016-07-18T18:21:32 <colinclark> how come?
2016-07-18T18:21:43 <amatas> avtar, ok
2016-07-18T18:22:19 <avtar> this http://docs.openstack.org/infra/jenkins-job-builder/properties.html#properties behavior seems to not be consistent with how the service was set up before the redeploy from a few days ago
2016-07-18T18:23:20 <avtar> in that child jobs don\'t seem to have access to the github url property from multijobs anymore
2016-07-18T18:23:57 <colinclark> ah

2016-07-18T19:52:52 <bens__> avtar, will the bot automatically build and test PRs created to the windows repo?
2016-07-18T19:53:24 <avtar> bens__: as long as the pr was created by an admin or a trusted user
2016-07-18T19:53:47 <avtar> if not then an admin will have to verify a PR\'s changes and then ask the ci server to build/test

2016-07-18T19:59:18 <colinclark> there\'s two successes now, avtar
2016-07-18T19:59:21 <colinclark> this is getting hot
2016-07-18T19:59:28 <colinclark> and way less spammy
2016-07-18T19:59:55 <avtar> yes
2016-07-18T20:00:50 <avtar> in retrospect i should have probably started with the repository with fewer PRs first
2016-07-18T20:01:41 <colinclark> :)
2016-07-18T20:01:55 <colinclark> what\'s a 190 emails or so, anyway?

2016-07-18T14:41:23 <avtar> pretty well
2016-07-18T14:41:29 <colinclark> awesome
2016-07-18T14:41:40 <avtar> i wanted to check in regarding https://github.com/GPII/ci-service/pull/16 and whether making those changes to the ci system should happen soon
2016-07-18T14:42:15 <colinclark> I think we\'re good to go, don\'t you?
2016-07-18T14:42:29 <avtar> i think so
2016-07-18T14:42:35 <colinclark> Sounds like you didn\'t get any concerns raised on the list
2016-07-18T14:42:40 <colinclark> I can merge this today if you\'d like
2016-07-18T14:42:45 <avtar> that would be awsome
2016-07-18T14:42:51 <colinclark> ok, cool
2016-07-18T14:43:13 <avtar> my preference would be earlier in the day just in case issues arise

2016-07-18T14:43:49 <colinclark> michelled: Remind me again; the due date for our Prosperity4All Nexus and QI videos... end of the month?
2016-07-18T14:45:42 <michelled> colinclark: yep. It might be august 2nd or something like that
2016-07-18T14:48:17 <colinclark> ok
2016-07-18T14:48:51 <colinclark> i\'m bringing in all 400 GB of footage we\'ve got
2016-07-18T14:49:14 <colinclark> and I\'ll set up a machine with Final Cut Pro on it
2016-07-18T14:49:24 <colinclark> I think I can get the audio and video synced in the next day or two
2016-07-18T14:49:41 <colinclark> and then presumably we can all work on the editing
2016-07-18T14:51:50 <michelled> cool! I\'m looking forward to learning some new skills

2016-07-18T16:55:48 <danayo> thanks gtirloni
2016-07-18T16:55:55 <jhung> michelled: lemme see
2016-07-18T16:57:10 <jhung> michelled: ah. Because it is a redirect. Trying to access ./practices/index.html redirects you to ./practices/Collaborate.html
2016-07-18T16:57:42 <jhung> I wonder if we can restyle that redirect message so it doesn\'t look so much like an error.
2016-07-18T16:58:21 <jhung> Right now the behaviour is correct (it\'s intended). That redirect page you see briefly can be better.

2016-07-18T17:00:37 <jhung> gtirloni: do you know if there\'s any way I can restyle the redirect page? Is it a matter of creating a 301.html page?
2016-07-18T17:01:42 <gtirloni> it\'s not a server-side redirect, it\'s using a client-side http redirect, right? I think it\'s a matter of editing those index.html files in each directory

2016-07-18T17:04:24 <jhung> gtirloni: ah got it. Currently there isn\'t any index.html for those directories, which explains the default looking redirect.

2016-07-18T17:11:29 <jhernandez> very exciting!!
2016-07-18T17:11:33 <amatas> ohmy...
2016-07-18T17:11:46 * wannabeCitizen joined the channel
2016-07-18T17:11:53 <jhernandez> excellent job guys! :)
2016-07-18T17:12:11 <jhernandez> only a thing ....
2016-07-18T17:12:32 <jhernandez> I\'d say gpii-bot deserves an icon :P
2016-07-18T17:12:54 <michelled> it certainly is talkative :)
2016-07-18T17:13:29 <amatas> h-0005 is shaking as a washing machine
2016-07-18T17:14:00 <avtar> colinclark: is the bot a collaborator for each of those repositories?
2016-07-18T17:14:17 <colinclark> avtar: I don\'t know
2016-07-18T17:14:20 <colinclark> I shall check
2016-07-18T17:14:49 <michelled> jhung, why do we want the redirect?
2016-07-18T17:15:39 <colinclark> avtar: Is a "read" collaborator sufficient for the bot?
2016-07-18T17:17:52 <avtar> colinclark: i tested with more privileges
2016-07-18T17:17:54 <avtar> https://github.com/jenkinsci/ghprb-plugin/blob/master/README.md#pre-installation
2016-07-18T17:18:19 <colinclark> needs to have push rights, I wonder why?
2016-07-18T17:18:46 <avtar> the bot can merge changes if instructed but i\'m assuming people will want to do that using their own accounts
2016-07-18T17:19:14 <jhung> michelled: because the first page to be leaded in each section is a specific page in that section. We don\'t have "landing" / index pages for those sections.
2016-07-18T17:19:19 <avtar> i\'m seeing errors that the bot couldn\'t update the commit status on pull requests :/
2016-07-18T17:19:37 <jhung> It didn\'t seem right to duplicate content from one page into an index.html file and have 2 copies michelled.
2016-07-18T17:19:55 <michelled> jhung, I think it will feel broken to redirect - can we put the link to the page we are interested in directly?
2016-07-18T17:20:20 <avtar> colinclark: "the user account does not have write access to the repo."
2016-07-18T17:20:55 <colinclark> jhung, michelled: Yeah, it does seem strange from a user experience perspective to have redirects on each of the tabs
2016-07-18T17:21:09 <colinclark> especially because the redirect pages themselves end up in the user\'s history
2016-07-18T17:22:09 <colinclark> avtar: I\'m still confused
2016-07-18T17:22:20 <jhung> danayo and I were hoping to avoid having landing pages or indexes for those sections. But from what you\'re suggesting I guess we can\'t avoid it colinclark michelled.
2016-07-18T17:23:10 <michelled> jhung: I agree that we shouldn\'t duplicate content
2016-07-18T17:23:20 <michelled> what I\'m not understanding, is why we can\'t link directly
2016-07-18T17:23:26 * yzen is now known as yzen_
2016-07-18T17:23:33 <jhung> The idea was to have the user get right into the content without having to go through another click / page.
2016-07-18T17:23:48 <danayo> jhung - can we not link directly to the first page on the list?
2016-07-18T17:23:56 <colinclark> yeah
2016-07-18T17:23:59 <colinclark> jhung: Is there a reason the links on each tab don\'t just point to the page you\'re redirecting to?
2016-07-18T17:24:18 <jhung> colinclark: because that\'d be too easy. :D
2016-07-18T17:24:21 <colinclark> So for example, the Tools tab could like directly to http://guide.inclusivedesign.ca/tools/UXWalkthroughs.html
2016-07-18T17:24:22 <michelled> hahaha
2016-07-18T17:24:25 <colinclark> jhung: hahaha :)
