2016-04-06T13:47:06 <Bosmon> Hi gtirloni
2016-04-06T13:47:10 <Bosmon> The new GPII Etherpad is really cool
2016-04-06T13:47:19 <Bosmon> But I cannot understand in the user interface how I can create a new pad
2016-04-06T13:47:30 <Bosmon> I wonder what it is about the usability of interfaces designed by nerds
2016-04-06T13:47:40 <Bosmon> That the single most common action is the one which is impossible to discover
2016-04-06T13:47:58 <gtirloni> Bosmon: it is, kudos to alfredo for deploying it :)
2016-04-06T13:48:07 <gtirloni> indeed, it took me a while to understand that as well
2016-04-06T13:48:12 <gtirloni> it seems pads can only exist inside a folder
2016-04-06T13:48:15 <Bosmon> Yes
2016-04-06T13:48:18 <Bosmon> I am looking at this "folder" fiew
2016-04-06T13:48:27 <Bosmon> Oh I see
2016-04-06T13:48:31 <Bosmon> I must create a FOLDER first
2016-04-06T13:48:36 <Bosmon> And THEN I can create a pad?!
2016-04-06T13:48:38 <gtirloni> yeah.. UX disaster, imho.
2016-04-06T13:48:44 <Bosmon> And there is no folder by default......
2016-04-06T13:48:45 <Bosmon> "hilarious"

2016-04-06T14:31:27 <Justin_o> i\'m going to leave some comments too, but wondering what you think of the approach in general
2016-04-06T14:31:59 <jhung> sure I\'ll take a look at it later today Justin_o.
2016-04-06T14:33:49 <Justin_o> jhung: thanks

2016-04-06T14:35:48 * Katy joined the channel
2016-04-06T14:40:19 <Katy> cindyli. Question regarding the flow we discussed yesterday.  UntrustedFlowManger.js, line 99 is the gpii.flowManager.untrusted.userLogin.handler.  My notes show that the flow next went to the UserLogonStateChange.js , line 113 (gpii.flowManager.userLogonStateChange.handleRequest). Can you explain how it went to 113.
2016-04-06T14:42:26 * Awesome_Arnold joined the channel
2016-04-06T14:44:51 <cindyli> Katy: that\'s where the grade/parent grade kicks in. if you look at UntrustedFlowManger.js, line 100, the component "gpii.flowManager.untrusted.stateChangeHandler" uses a parent grade "gpii.flowManager.userLogonStateChange.stateChangeHandler"
2016-04-06T14:45:32 <cindyli> this parent component is defined in UserLogonStateChange.js, line 65
2016-04-06T14:46:46 <cindyli> it\'s also the parent component of "gpii.flowManager.userLogonStateChange.matchMakingStateChangeHandler" at line 87 in the same file
2016-04-06T14:46:53 <Katy> cindyli thank you that explains that question.
2016-04-06T14:47:10 <cindyli> you are welome, Katy
2016-04-06T14:51:14 * Awesome_Arnold has quit
2016-04-06T14:51:39 <Katy> cindyli. Another question. UsrLogonStateChange.js line 62  does  "that.events.onUserToken.fire(userToken);". Which I believe "that" is from the UntrustedFlowManager events., line 81.  How and where is the onUserToken set?
2016-04-06T14:52:45 <Katy> cindyli  The question I have is how does it match to go to UserLogonStateChange.js, line 91
2016-04-06T14:55:48 <cindyli> Katy: with using an event, first, the event needs to be defined. in ur case, onUserToken event is defined in UntrustedFlowManager.js, line 81
2016-04-06T14:56:43 <cindyli> then, any number of listeners can be defined to listen to this event, UserLogonStateChange.js, line 91 is one of those listeners

2016-04-06T19:32:51 <jhung> alanharnum: regarding class selectors, there are some in the charts that need new selectors too. i.e.\xc2\xa0floec-ca-lineChart-y-axis etc.
2016-04-06T19:41:53 <alanharnum> jhung: ok - i\'ll go through and make sure everything\'s got a floe-* as well as floec-*
2016-04-06T19:42:27 <jhung> alanharnum: thanks. Not everything may need it - only the stuff we\'ll probably want to style.
2016-04-06T19:42:41 <alanharnum> it\'s good future-proofing
2016-04-06T19:43:03 <alanharnum> as long as i\'m touching all the stuff that applies the classes

2016-04-06T20:11:44 <jhung> alanharnum: for the largegraphs control. What did you envision happening when that is enabled?
2016-04-06T20:12:28 <alanharnum> jhung: the graphs should get larger, similar to a text zoom
2016-04-06T20:13:26 <alanharnum> i found the behaviour a bit fiddly myself when i was originally doing things, but the way it was working was that you could resize the parent container of the graph SVG, and the SVG would rescale in response
2016-04-06T20:13:34 <jhung> alanharnum: do they get larger on screen or do they just get larger in scale and axis ticks & text?
2016-04-06T20:14:21 <jhung> ok. For now I\'ll just increase the size of the container alanharnum.
2016-04-06T20:15:23 <alanharnum> dynamically rescaling within the existing container size is something i think i\'d consider doing for the future, but yeah, for the moment I\'d just increase container size
