2016-08-23T16:14:38 <gtirloni> bens__: good idea! i\'ll add that
2016-08-23T16:17:01 <Justin_o> simonjb: would you be able to check in with your GSoC student about talking at a community meeting and if he\'d like stickers. I sent you an e-mail last week with some details. I know you were away, so if you\'d need me to resend that, just let me know.
2016-08-23T16:21:46 <simonjb> I will do it today Justin_o

2016-08-23T17:54:37 <cindyli> ok, Justin_o
2016-08-23T17:55:07 <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks
2016-08-23T17:55:35 <cindyli> np
2016-08-23T17:58:21 <Justin_o> avtar: am looking at https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/720/files
2016-08-23T17:58:53 <Justin_o> avtar: so it doesn\'t introduce any new dependencies? and i assume it will generate a report.tap file at the root.. is there a way to clean this up?
2016-08-23T17:58:53 <avtar> Justin_o: one sec, on a call with cindyli
2016-08-23T17:59:53 <Justin_o> avtar: no problem..
2016-08-23T18:00:32 <Justin_o> Bosmon: had left a question in the Infusion 2.0 priorities e-mail about the PR. "we should follow up on #720 to find out what it depends on and what it will enable"

2016-08-23T18:17:33 <avtar> yes, it will generate a report.tap file in the root of the git working directory
2016-08-23T18:18:14 <Justin_o> is that in the testing VM or the actual project root?
2016-08-23T18:18:16 <Justin_o> avtar: ^
2016-08-23T18:18:33 <avtar> the latter
2016-08-23T18:18:53 <Justin_o> okay thanks, we should update the grunt clean task so that it removes that file before doing a build
2016-08-23T18:19:03 <Justin_o> we don\'t want to accidentally include that in a package
2016-08-23T18:19:12 <avtar> ah good point
2016-08-23T18:19:15 <Justin_o> and it\'s also useful to have a way to just clean it out if you wanted to delete it
2016-08-23T18:22:19 <TPark> sepidehshahi, danayo: this is one of the activities we were thinking about to help promote an inclusive design process: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n4ugPjb7K5syCxfIAoQdrDkVUD6oPyU5ULHWHhB0A70/edit?usp=sharing
2016-08-23T18:22:37 <TPark> sepidehshahi, danayo: any feedback would be appreciated
2016-08-23T18:24:06 <sepidehshahi> Thanks TPark, I\xe2\x80\x99ll read the doc and will add comments
2016-08-23T18:25:43 <TPark> sepidehshahi, danayo: this is the other one: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g6qwko2ROQacZJ1MWu8vG7Z-3h4Zv-D6--M67s_ellQ/edit?usp=sharing
2016-08-23T18:25:51 <danayo> that sounds good TPark. Especially the idea of providing a practical example
2016-08-23T18:30:43 <sepidehshahi> TPark, godfrey_: and danayo in the first activity, participants can also discuss the common points among their cards and talk come up with a scenario that most of their cards are used.
2016-08-23T18:31:25 <godfrey_> danayo, sepidehshahi: The second link/activity we sent was similar to the process TPark and I underwent with the examples we showed during the design crit two weeks ago. We aren\'t sure if the wording gets our point across so your feedback is much appreciated!
2016-08-23T18:32:23 <godfrey_> sepidehshahi: thats a great idea!
2016-08-23T18:33:22 <danayo> godfrey_ TPark: for the second activity, it seems a bit vague - I got that you were addressing the examples/flow that you had created - but I\'m not sure it\'s clear enough. I wonder if you could be a bit more specific somehow
2016-08-23T18:36:09 <TPark> danayo: yeah, we have been struggling with this one. We want to make it more clear without narrowing people\'s thought process.
2016-08-23T18:36:58 <TPark> danayo: there is also the issue, that we had full knowledge of the cards prior to doing this, while it may be the first time going through the cards for the person doing the activity
2016-08-23T18:40:35 <godfrey_> danayo: we also wanted to make sure that the focus isnt on creating a solution or "achieving inclusivity" at the end of the activity but rather on the process

2016-08-23T20:55:36 <simonjb> hey Bosmon and Bosmon7, I was doing some testing on your journaling pull this afternoon and am seeing some inconsistent failures when running the windows acceptance tests against your universal
2016-08-23T20:56:11 <simonjb> gtirloni helped me work through it and he found https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-1108
2016-08-23T20:56:16 <simonjb> avtar: ^
2016-08-23T20:56:59 <simonjb> which seems to match (not exactly the same but close -- that but is from > 1 year ago) what I\'m seeing
2016-08-23T20:57:11 <simonjb> https://gist.github.com/simonbates/9b17490f03cd66eb3655bd061f3f9391
2016-08-23T20:57:30 <simonjb> does that seem like a reasonable explanation?
2016-08-23T20:57:43 <simonjb> or does it require more investigation?
2016-08-23T20:58:09 * sepidehshahi has quit
2016-08-23T20:59:22 <simonjb> is that issue, GPII-1108, on our radar to address?

2016-08-23T21:27:54 <Bosmon7> 1108 specifically is not on our radar soon
2016-08-23T21:28:07 <Bosmon7> But Steve Grundell\'s GPII-581 could make these issues rarer
2016-08-23T21:28:33 <Bosmon7> simonjb - I wonder if you were able to use the journalling system to recover from any desktop corruption caused by this bug?
2016-08-23T21:28:40 <Bosmon7> It would be a good test of it if you were :)
2016-08-23T21:29:24 <simonjb> it didn\'t appear to leave any corruption -- I did think of trying that, yes :)
2016-08-23T21:31:42 * alanharnum has quit
2016-08-23T21:32:34 <simonjb> thanks Bosmon7, I think I won\'t worry too much about that particular failure for now then, I\'ll add a note to GPII-1108 linking to my gist in case it\'s useful in the future

2016-08-23T13:23:42 <cindyli> hi kasparnet
2016-08-23T13:24:06 <kasparnet> I\'m looking at getting the preferences editor to load prefs on startup (if the user is already logged in)
2016-08-23T13:24:40 <cindyli> which preferences editor, kasparnet
2016-08-23T13:24:45 <kasparnet> do you know if there is a "correct" (or just simple) way to pass the initial preferences to the preferences framework
2016-08-23T13:25:02 <kasparnet> the once-was-called-first-discovery-tool
2016-08-23T13:25:10 <cindyli> ok, i see
2016-08-23T13:25:51 <cindyli> the easy way is to overwrite the starter schema, having a look on the code
2016-08-23T13:31:21 * alanharnum joined the channel
2016-08-23T13:31:39 <kasparnet> thanks cindyli, looking too
2016-08-23T13:32:56 <cindyli> overwriting starter schemas is too brutal. I\'m looking at which option can be used
2016-08-23T13:36:20 <alanharnum> Bosmon / Bosmon7: did some further commits on https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/732 to address the comments about the \'task\' naming convention, etc
2016-08-23T13:37:02 <Bosmon7> cindyli - overriding the starter schema isn\'t a sensible scheme
2016-08-23T13:37:10 * yzen joined the channel
2016-08-23T13:37:22 <Bosmon7> You can just add a grade in to the main prefs editor that contains extra model material
2016-08-23T13:41:15 <cindyli> ya, trying to find an example
2016-08-23T13:45:00 <cindyli> kasparnet: only found some code in first discovery tests. this is how the default language is overridden:
2016-08-23T13:45:02 <cindyli> https://github.com/GPII/first-discovery/blob/master/tests/js/firstDiscoveryEditorTests.js#L210-L219
2016-08-23T13:45:16 <cindyli> https://github.com/GPII/first-discovery/blob/master/tests/js/firstDiscoveryEditorTests.js#L242-L243
2016-08-23T13:46:22 <cindyli> the first discovery tool initial prefs model should use these keys: https://github.com/GPII/first-discovery/blob/master/tests/js/firstDiscoveryEditorTests.js#L677-L687
2016-08-23T13:52:22 * kasparnet is looking at cindyli\'s links
2016-08-23T13:53:10 <cindyli> kasparnet: which days do you work? i may need your help for setting up the flow manager in production mode
2016-08-23T13:53:39 <kasparnet> I\'m working today, but gotta leave shortly
2016-08-23T13:53:46 <kasparnet> but else tomorrow and thursday
2016-08-23T13:54:07 <cindyli> cool. not going to be today for sure. I need to rule out some other failures before we meet
2016-08-23T13:56:16 <kasparnet> ok - cool - just give me a ping when you wanna talk

2016-08-23T14:19:06 <cindyli> ok Justin_o
2016-08-23T14:20:59 <nitkul> i should use build/infusion-all.js in my html after running \'npm install\' and \'grunt\' on the dir?
2016-08-23T14:26:16 <Justin_o> nitkul: would you be able to provide some more context around what you\'d like to do?
2016-08-23T14:26:29 <Justin_o> alanharnum: you might be able to help nitkul as well
2016-08-23T14:27:15 <nitkul> i am creating a page to test some features
2016-08-23T14:27:51 <alanharnum> nitkul: including infusion-all.js is definitely the simplest way to get started
2016-08-23T14:28:02 * kasparnet joined the channel
2016-08-23T14:28:31 <alanharnum> if you want to test & exercise the features of the core framework
2016-08-23T14:29:09 <Justin_o> nitkul: depending on what you are testing, you may also need to include the html, css, and etc that are in the directories adjacent to infusion-all.js
2016-08-23T14:29:38 <nitkul> do i need to add jquery seperately?
2016-08-23T14:30:03 <alanharnum> nitkul: nope, that will be included in infusion-all.js
2016-08-23T14:33:33 <nitkul> ok so i moved \'infusion\' to a project and ran \'npm install && grunt\'
2016-08-23T14:33:51 <nitkul> and then added /build/infusion-all.js
2016-08-23T14:33:58 <nitkul> should work. right?

2016-08-23T14:50:46 <Justin_o> nitkul: are you sure your web server is properly serving it up?
2016-08-23T14:51:13 <Justin_o> nitkul: also do you have something we could look at, e.g. the code in a git repo or the test page running somewhere?
2016-08-23T14:51:58 <nitkul> web server? can you elaborate that?

2016-08-23T14:55:35 <the-t-in-rtf> I finished integrating the new `gpii.pouch` grade into `gpii.pouch.express`.
2016-08-23T14:55:50 <the-t-in-rtf> You should both be able to work with the same branch and the latest commit referenced in the PR.
2016-08-23T14:56:02 <simonjb> awesome, thanks the-t-in-rtf
2016-08-23T14:56:26 <the-t-in-rtf> @cindyli, there are now separate "persistent" grades which do a lot of the work for you, you should only have to change one option (baseDir)
2016-08-23T14:56:48 <the-t-in-rtf> A lot of things were collapsed into other things, in general things should be easier to use, read, understand.
2016-08-23T14:58:05 <cindyli> cool, the-t-in-rtf, will have a look on the persistent grades. btw, the persistence issue was resolved once I defined dbPath option
2016-08-23T14:58:24 <the-t-in-rtf> cool.  That option was confusingly named and redundant.
2016-08-23T14:58:29 <the-t-in-rtf> It has gone away in the newest code
2016-08-23T14:58:37 <the-t-in-rtf> the new option is just the baseDir option
2016-08-23T14:58:43 <the-t-in-rtf> that should be the only change you have to make.
2016-08-23T14:59:15 <the-t-in-rtf> and you shouldn\'t have to distribute it yourself
2016-08-23T14:59:31 <the-t-in-rtf> you should just be able to set it in the top level grade (harness or testEnvironment)
2016-08-23T15:00:15 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, take a look.  I am heading home, but may be around for a few minutes once dinner is in the oven.

2016-08-23T15:01:44 <cindyli> sounds great. thanks, the-t-in-rtf
2016-08-23T15:01:48 <Justin_o> nitkul: how are you accessing your test page?
2016-08-23T15:02:13 <nitkul> it\'s on my machine
2016-08-23T15:02:47 <Justin_o> nitkul: are you creating a web page or a node app?
2016-08-23T15:03:48 <nitkul> web page. p.s. i sorted the error. i didn\'t read the docs too carefully. :-X
2016-08-23T15:05:02 <alanharnum> nitkul: you\'ll probably want to run a local web server to develop, although looking at the page directly is probably OK to start
2016-08-23T15:05:09 <cindyli> Justin_o: ur infusion and infusion-docs pulls are merged and deployed
2016-08-23T15:05:18 <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks
2016-08-23T15:05:18 <alanharnum> you\'ll run into issues with AJAX etc if you aren\'t running a local server
2016-08-23T15:07:34 <nitkul> alanharnum: ok
2016-08-23T15:07:51 <nitkul> thanks, peeps
2016-08-23T15:07:52 <alanharnum> nitkul: what operating system are you using?
2016-08-23T15:08:00 <nitkul> ubuntu 16
2016-08-23T15:09:19 <alanharnum> this is my fave for quickly running a local server specific to a directory for development (you may know it already): http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/tech-tip-really-simple-http-server-python
2016-08-23T15:09:43 <alanharnum> dead simple, works on nearly any modern Linux system (and Mac OS X) since they all have Python 2 installed by default.

2016-08-23T15:23:30 <avtar> sure
2016-08-23T15:23:35 <avtar> does either 12:30 or 1:00 work?
2016-08-23T15:25:11 <cindyli> both works, avtar, let\'s do 12:30
2016-08-23T15:25:18 <avtar> ok
