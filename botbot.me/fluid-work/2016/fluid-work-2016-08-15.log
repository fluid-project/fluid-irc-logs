2016-08-15T15:18:02 <gtirloni> colinclark: a-v-t-a-r (avoiding triggering his notification during his retreat :P) left a few notes about what a tool that interprets those .qi.yml should do, and i\'m working on getting something done while he\'s away. i wanted to double check an idea i had for this
2016-08-15T15:18:19 <colinclark> hahaha
2016-08-15T15:18:27 <colinclark> cool, fire away, gtirloni
2016-08-15T15:18:49 <gtirloni> colinclark: right now project owners have to keep a Vagrantfile and provision directory with a bunch of files that 1) they don\'t need to understand, 2) rarely changes and 3) duplicates information already in the proposed .qi.yml (here i\'m talking about provisioning/vars.yml)
2016-08-15T15:19:01 <colinclark> yes, those are all true
2016-08-15T15:19:33 <gtirloni> i was thinking this tool that will read .qi.yml files should also take care of generating the Vagrantfile and the necessary bits in the provisioning directly (so we can continue to re-use the work we did with the ansible roles, etc)
2016-08-15T15:19:48 <gtirloni> so then all the developers really need to do is worry about .qi.yml and nothing else
2016-08-15T15:19:50 * the-t-in-rtf has quit
2016-08-15T15:20:13 <gtirloni> someone would then bootstrap their local QI environment by running, say, `qi compile` and that would be generated
2016-08-15T15:20:37 <gtirloni> people would need to download this `qi` tool however
2016-08-15T15:20:49 <gtirloni> put it in their $HOME/bin or somewhere it\'s easy to use
2016-08-15T15:21:59 <gtirloni> i\'m thinking this would help simplifying things but also making sure we can control the Vagrantfile/provisioning files from a central place, so when things need to change (e.g. we determine 3d is wonky), we can change that and developers just run `qi compile` again to pick up the changes
2016-08-15T15:23:03 <gtirloni> it\'s important to keep in mind this is trying to address the local and remote CI use cases (which adds some complexity that we addressed in all those ansible roles)... so at the CI server, this tool would be very useful too
2016-08-15T15:24:02 <gtirloni> i think not only the CI use case but the local development environment use case..  developer spins up a new VM to work on project X, edit code, see changes live, etc..   so it\'s like Travis (remote CI) + local CI + local dev env, in fact
2016-08-15T15:24:11 <gtirloni> any thoughts?
2016-08-15T15:26:44 <colinclark> Yes, I think it makes sense
2016-08-15T15:27:51 <colinclark> Ideally, it\'d be nice to just "npm install -g" the qi command line utility :)
2016-08-15T15:28:12 <gtirloni> good point
2016-08-15T15:29:31 * cindyli joined the channel
2016-08-15T15:31:26 <gtirloni> i\'m trying to imagine if this workflow would create any traps for us in the future
2016-08-15T15:33:26 <colinclark> I guess the biggest question is the degree to which the qi config ends up becoming like the Vagrant file and provisioning files
2016-08-15T15:33:39 <colinclark> in that they represent things you have to duplicate in a lot of detail in every repository
2016-08-15T15:33:46 <colinclark> but hopefully that\'s a design issue
2016-08-15T15:33:49 <colinclark> which we can address
2016-08-15T15:34:08 <gtirloni> yeah
2016-08-15T15:34:20 <gtirloni> it\'d be the place where we hide the \'ugliness\' of what\'s bellow
2016-08-15T15:34:29 <gtirloni> with hopefully some decent defaults
2016-08-15T15:42:17 <colinclark> I guess technologies that simply try to hide ugliness are probably the worst kind
2016-08-15T15:42:28 <colinclark> in that they prevent you from expressing something you need
2016-08-15T15:42:50 <colinclark> or they have a massively cliff you drop off
2016-08-15T15:43:14 <colinclark> where an incomplete abstraction just fails, and suddenly you\'re back to hacking Vagrantfiles or whatever
2016-08-15T15:45:01 <colinclark> Justin_o: I can look at your UIO stuff today
2016-08-15T15:45:21 * alanharnum joined the channel
2016-08-15T15:45:22 <colinclark> but one thing that would be very helpful is a summary of what you\'ve discovered, and what you think it means
2016-08-15T15:46:49 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2016-08-15T15:48:51 <gtirloni> colinclark: agreed, that might become an issue in that case. the qi tool would certainly limit the set of options currently spread/available in vagrantfiles and ansible roles. maybe it\'s a better tool for the backend CI system, as opposed to being available to developers directly
2016-08-15T15:56:06 <colinclark> Well, it seems like you\'re probably on the right track to expose it to developers directly
2016-08-15T15:56:09 <colinclark> for two reasons
2016-08-15T15:56:27 <colinclark> 1. We already have a very significant problem of Vagrantfile duplication across our repositories
2016-08-15T15:56:56 <colinclark> 2. Developers, I think, will benefit from using the same infrastructure as on the backend CI system
2016-08-15T15:58:29 <colinclark> For many of our projects, it will be hugely beneficial if that "qi compiler" can be integrated into the rest of our, like it or not, npm-based infrastructure\xe2\x80\x94so that we can, say, just run "npm run qi-vm" to compile the appropriate Vagrantfiles and then up vagrant
2016-08-15T15:59:02 <Justin_o> colinclark: In terms of lazy loading the prefs enhancer... it saves a lot of time in the case where no preferences are applied ( although that time seams longer because it is displayed as idle time in chrome\'s metrics ). In the case where there are preferences that do need to be applied, it will add overhead and increase the load times.. which is to be
2016-08-15T15:59:02 <Justin_o> expected
2016-08-15T15:59:22 <colinclark> To what extent, Justin_o?
2016-08-15T15:59:36 <colinclark> and what is the user experience of those increased load times?
2016-08-15T15:59:37 <Justin_o> i think we should also investigate lazy loading the css specifically for the contrast themes as we end up having thousands of unused styles on a page
2016-08-15T15:59:48 <colinclark> any jankiness or whatever?
2016-08-15T15:59:51 <colinclark> Justin_o: That sounds sensible
2016-08-15T16:01:11 <Justin_o> colinclark: yes to jankiness as the styles have to load and then be applied. It\'s hard to know the extent of that as an issue though as it\'s likely dependent on the network connection
2016-08-15T16:01:49 <colinclark> can you characterize this a bit more?
2016-08-15T16:03:33 <gtirloni> colinclark: makes sense. thanks for the input. i\'ll keep working on a prototype here to validate some ideas
2016-08-15T16:03:45 <colinclark> cool\xe2\x80\x94I\'m looking forward to seeing it
2016-08-15T16:05:27 <Justin_o> colinclark: was that question for me or gtirloni
2016-08-15T16:05:39 <colinclark> you, Justin_o
2016-08-15T16:05:48 <colinclark> can you, JUSTIN_O, characterize this a bit more?
2016-08-15T16:05:49 <colinclark> :)
2016-08-15T16:06:07 <colinclark> can you, THE KING, characterize the experience and nature of the jankiness for me?
2016-08-15T16:08:23 <Justin_o> colinclark: the nature of the jankiness is that it has to check the cookie, determine if there are preferences to be applied, then load in the js files, then instantiate the cookieStore and pageEnhancer
2016-08-15T16:09:25 <colinclark> What does it look like?
2016-08-15T16:09:32 <colinclark> how awful does it strike you?

2016-08-15T16:12:57 <Justin_o> colinclark: it\'s probably fine in my example, it looks like the screen flash momentarily. However, that\'s probably with a best case scenario setup
2016-08-15T16:13:11 * danayo joined the channel
2016-08-15T16:13:43 <colinclark> Justin_o: Do you have any means to experiemnt with a less-than-ideal scenario?
2016-08-15T16:14:24 <Justin_o> hmm.. let me check
2016-08-15T16:18:12 <Justin_o> colinclark: so in chrome you can enable throttling in the network tab of the developer tools
2016-08-15T16:19:03 <Justin_o> colinclark: it\'s kind of hard to quantify... even without the throttling it\'s more noticeable than in Safari, which is where i had previously tried it today.
2016-08-15T16:19:32 <Justin_o> colinclark: in chrome with the different levels of throttling you\'ll see the portions of the page gradually load in, and the various preferences be applied.
2016-08-15T16:19:43 <Justin_o> colinclark: it may not seem strange if you are used to the pages loading slower though
2016-08-15T16:20:57 <Justin_o> colinclark: also it\'s likely going to depend on which preferences you are applying. something like Table of Contents and or things that change the layout would be more disruptive as they\'ll move the content of the page
