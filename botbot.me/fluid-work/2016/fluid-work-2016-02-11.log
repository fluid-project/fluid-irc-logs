2016-02-11T22:03:18 <colinclark> I will do some refactoring to the code when I get a chance
2016-02-11T22:03:34 <colinclark> and I temporarily made the grid layout much wider to work around the worst of my triggering bug
2016-02-11T22:03:51 <simonjb> thanks colinclark, I'll integrate it now
2016-02-11T22:50:01 <colinclark> simonjb makes the sweetest software music

2016-02-11T15:28:27 <colinclark> simonjb: I wrote you an email last night but somehow didn\'t manage to send it
2016-02-11T15:28:55 <simonjb> colinclark: no problem
2016-02-11T15:29:18 <colinclark> The short version of it is that I quite dorkily moved repositories in order to be able to easily issue pull requests to the fluid-studios org for it
2016-02-11T15:29:20 <colinclark> https://github.com/colinbdclark/flocking-nexus-headtracker-synth
2016-02-11T15:29:25 <colinclark> There are updates there
2016-02-11T15:29:39 <colinclark> It makes sense to pull it in as a dependency via npm
2016-02-11T15:29:56 <colinclark> and you should be able to do so with a Git reference in your "dependencies" block
2016-02-11T15:30:17 <colinclark> something like { "headtracker-synth": "colinbdclark/flocking-nexus-headtracker-synth" }
2016-02-11T15:30:33 <colinclark> The component should really be self-rendering
2016-02-11T15:30:39 <simonjb> at the moment, I am serving web pages from nexus-examples/public
2016-02-11T15:30:51 <colinclark> yeah
2016-02-11T15:30:59 <simonjb> if I use the project package.json, I would need to serve the root of the project?
2016-02-11T15:31:12 <colinclark> I suppose you would, yes
2016-02-11T15:31:19 <simonjb> ok, I think that\'s fine
2016-02-11T15:31:30 <colinclark> I guess it\'s not ideal
2016-02-11T15:31:48 <simonjb> there\'s nothing sensitive and it\'s the easiest thing
2016-02-11T15:31:57 <colinclark> I think I\'m only an hour or two from having it make sound now
2016-02-11T15:32:02 <simonjb> yeah!
2016-02-11T15:32:20 <colinclark> I added some very inefficient "hit testing" last night
2016-02-11T15:32:34 <colinclark> so now all I need is to build the synth and wire up the right events
2016-02-11T15:32:36 <simonjb> thanks colinclark -- I\'ll switch over to the new repo location and use npm to pull it in
2016-02-11T15:32:42 <colinclark> sorry about switching repos
2016-02-11T15:32:56 <simonjb> no problem at all, very small change
2016-02-11T15:34:41 <colinclark> simonjb: I was reminded in the midst of all this how really hard it is still to build even simple UIs
2016-02-11T15:34:53 <colinclark> so many moving pieces
2016-02-11T15:34:59 <colinclark> knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript
2016-02-11T15:36:36 <alanharnum> i think the difficulty of building web UIs is on the stronger arguments for webcomponents
2016-02-11T15:37:09 * alanharnum can see de facto or standards-based libraries of UI primitives eventually emerging
2016-02-11T15:37:29 <alanharnum> building a web UI definitely sucks as a designer/developer experience compared to some of the tools for building and wiring desktop apps
2016-02-11T15:43:18 <alanharnum> SPEAKING OF GREAT WEB UIs
2016-02-11T15:43:41 <alanharnum> i would like to remind everyone that the cat-based sonification prototype from February of last year is available at http://rawgit.com/waharnum/idrc-sprint-2015/master/frontend/index.html
2016-02-11T15:43:50 <colinclark> hahaha
2016-02-11T15:43:56 <colinclark> I\'m not sure I agree, from experience
2016-02-11T15:44:20 <colinclark> I imagined at one time, too, that there would be these kinds of strong repositories of basic UI components on the web
2016-02-11T15:44:33 <colinclark> and there have been dozens and dozens of projects that have tried
2016-02-11T15:44:34 * alanharnum recommends that jessm bring a wireless speaker on the boat next week and just use "Play Alternative" continuously when trying to explain what we do
2016-02-11T15:45:04 <alanharnum> yeah
2016-02-11T15:45:23 <colinclark> but strangely it just never seems to happen
2016-02-11T15:45:28 <colinclark> the web is funny that way
2016-02-11T15:45:33 <alanharnum> i\'m curious (I can make some intellectual stabs) about why they haven\'t succeeded in changing how people do basic web development in the way that, say, DOM manipulation frameworks have
2016-02-11T15:45:57 <colinclark> I\'m not sure I can explain it
2016-02-11T15:46:07 <colinclark> other than to say that the web doesn\'t have, nor apparently will, a "vendor"
2016-02-11T15:46:49 <colinclark> on iOS or something, developers and designers are pretty much obligated to consume at least a minimal set of vendor components
2016-02-11T15:46:53 <colinclark> unless they\'re developing games
2016-02-11T15:47:01 <colinclark> for fear that they will be rejected from the App Store
2016-02-11T15:47:07 <colinclark> I mean, Linux is essentially entirely the same, too
2016-02-11T15:47:18 <colinclark> Dozens of UI toolkits
2016-02-11T15:47:28 <alanharnum> yeah that\'s an interesting point
2016-02-11T15:47:41 <colinclark> but other than that, I\'m not sure I can explain it
2016-02-11T15:48:15 <alanharnum> as a practical factor i\'ve seen up close, the influence of marketing departments and traditional graphic design management has been big
2016-02-11T15:48:35 <colinclark> there\'s some of that, yes
2016-02-11T15:48:54 <colinclark> interestingly, I was reading an article in the Verge about someone buying their mom a Chromebook in part because it provided a "more consistent UI experience"
2016-02-11T15:49:01 <colinclark> and this fascinated me
2016-02-11T15:49:09 <colinclark> since of course the web is such a hetereogeneous UI experience
2016-02-11T15:49:17 <alanharnum> when UI and branding are conflated (and branding often wins), it\'s hard to be able to unequivocally adopt a base UI toolkit and have that really make your job easier as a designer/developer
2016-02-11T15:49:42 <colinclark> I guess
2016-02-11T15:49:55 <colinclark> the less cynical part of it is that there is more genuine...hmmm...
2016-02-11T15:49:58 <colinclark> what\'s the word
2016-02-11T15:50:01 <alanharnum> in a way of lot of what has succeeded is frameworks and toolkits that make the generation of heterogeneous APIs easier
2016-02-11T15:50:04 <colinclark> I will say "innovation" but I don\'t quite mean that
2016-02-11T15:50:18 <colinclark> there is more genuine difference in web UI design than on native paltforms
2016-02-11T15:50:32 <alanharnum> jQuery, Backbone, Zurb, etc
2016-02-11T15:50:42 <alanharnum> boostrap
2016-02-11T15:50:42 <colinclark> yeah, perhaps
2016-02-11T15:51:04 * jhung has quit
2016-02-11T15:51:18 * jhung joined the channel
2016-02-11T15:51:18 <alanharnum> the tool stack is optimized and the mindshare is directed towards the basic core task of the average working web designer/developer (which is often the same person)
2016-02-11T15:51:41 <colinclark> It does seem like the "CSS + some extra stuff" frameworks have come closer to this kind of vision
2016-02-11T15:51:48 <colinclark> Bootstrap and Foundation
2016-02-11T15:52:12 <colinclark> I mean, IBM really genuinely believed I think with Dojo that they were going to get a standardized component set for building all their web apps
2016-02-11T15:52:20 <colinclark> Just Like Java
2016-02-11T15:52:29 <alanharnum> in a way i think those circumstances speak very positively about how the web authoring stack has evolved based on the interests and things of value to the average person who makes websites, rather than computer scientists or "software engineers"
2016-02-11T15:53:06 <alanharnum> if i work for an agency, or am a web designer/developer where most of my product is answerable to people in comms or marketing, i don\'t really care what traditional "software engineering" thinks is right
2016-02-11T15:53:17 * gloob has quit
2016-02-11T15:53:55 <alanharnum> what i want are tools that make my life easier for the circumstances i work under, not the circumstances software engineers think I work under / think i should work under

2016-02-11T16:04:39 * jhung1 joined the channel
2016-02-11T16:06:07 <colinclark> yes, that\'s a good point, alanharnum
2016-02-11T16:06:37 <alanharnum> where you\'ve seen really wild success is where people with serious development chops have taken the challenges of people who make websites seriously
2016-02-11T16:06:58 <alanharnum> and applied user-centered design to the real challenges they face
2016-02-11T16:08:08 <alanharnum> rather than the too-frequent cart-before-horse approach taken in designing tools, which we could go on about endlessly, etc etc
2016-02-11T16:09:49 <alanharnum> i\'d go so far as to say at a moral level there\'s a respect for the competence of the non-traditional programmer (the hybrid developer/designer/jack of all trades website maker) in a lot of the frameworks and tools where success has been achieved largely by community adoption, rather than IT department imposition
2016-02-11T16:11:11 <alanharnum> you can contrast that to all the tooling with an inherent assumption of the incompetence of the end user
2016-02-11T16:12:25 <alanharnum> i was just saying to simonjb a few days ago that part of my reflexive recoil from web components is that the tag-based syntax for using them reminds me of JSTL, one of the most end user hostile technologies i\'ve ever dealt with for making dynamic websites
2016-02-11T16:12:44 <alanharnum> which is probably unfair to web components as a technology :p

2016-02-11T16:46:41 <colinclark> danayo: I think the demo that simonjb and I are working on should be ready soon
2016-02-11T16:47:08 <colinclark> Perhaps we can arrange to have a basic build of it up somewhere so you can try it/hear it
2016-02-11T16:47:22 <colinclark> to use the headtracker, it requires Windows and some specialized software--Asterics
2016-02-11T16:47:33 <colinclark> but you can use it with the mouse, too
2016-02-11T16:47:47 <colinclark> you\'ll probably shudder at my terrible colour scheme, as simonjb referenced in standup
2016-02-11T16:59:06 * jhung joined the channel
2016-02-11T17:00:18 <danayo> can\'t wait colinclark!
2016-02-11T17:02:49 <colinclark> simonjb: Sometime it might be fun to implement an all-web head tracker with something like this: https://github.com/mtschirs/js-objectdetect
2016-02-11T17:03:05 <alanharnum> i\'ve dropped an outline of the one-pager text into https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Chart+Authoring+Introduction
2016-02-11T17:03:13 <colinclark> it apparently can use feature detection classifiers from OpenCV
2016-02-11T17:03:21 <alanharnum> would appreciate any feedback
2016-02-11T17:03:26 <colinclark> cool alanharnum, I\'ll take a look this afternoon!
2016-02-11T17:03:52 <simonjb> colinclark: cool project
2016-02-11T17:04:08 <alanharnum> also sent an everybody email - going to come into the office now for the 2:30 meeting, but feel free to comment here & I\'ll read the logs when i get in
2016-02-11T17:04:42 <alanharnum> thanks colinclark - I\'ll hammer it into shape later this aft once people have had a chance to take a look
2016-02-11T17:05:14 <colinclark> alanharnum: Emails like this should probably go to the Fluid list
2016-02-11T17:05:19 <alanharnum> one thing worth thinking about is whether we want a literal one-pager (something we can print double-sided and hand out) or if that\'s just a metaphor - i assumed the first, in which case we may want to apply a bit of visual design to any end product :)
2016-02-11T17:05:20 <colinclark> so our wider community can read it, too
2016-02-11T17:05:23 <alanharnum> good point
2016-02-11T17:05:31 <alanharnum> i\'ll send it there as well
2016-02-11T17:05:33 <alanharnum> fluid-work?
2016-02-11T17:05:40 <colinclark> yep
2016-02-11T17:05:49 <colinclark> I was thinking it was a metaphorical "one pager"
2016-02-11T17:06:03 <colinclark> i.e. a succinct, focused summary of what we\'ve done and what our goals and future directions are
2016-02-11T17:06:24 <alanharnum> OK - this fits that criteria too
2016-02-11T17:06:29 <colinclark> but even when it\'s just digital, visual design helps a lot
2016-02-11T17:06:34 <alanharnum> yeah

2016-02-11T13:39:10 <gtirloni> Justin_o: i re-ran the tests from yesterday and opened the following JIRAs: FLUID-5858, FLUID-5859, FLUID-5860, FLUID-5861, and FLUID-58
2016-02-11T13:39:48 <gtirloni> Justin_o: i tried running avtar\'s saucelabs branch, but all-tests.html doesn\'t work (it stays stuck in the first test forever). the standalone tests seem to work though -- on chrome48/linux
2016-02-11T13:40:02 <alanharnum> cindyli: so interesting thing re the test failure in Firefox yesterday - all the tests pass in the latest Firefox with the Web Speech API enabled (it\'s available, but you have to about:config it)
2016-02-11T13:40:02 <gtirloni> (last jira is FLUID-5862)
2016-02-11T13:40:33 <cindyli> good to know, alanharnum
2016-02-11T13:40:36 <cindyli> trying
2016-02-11T13:40:46 <alanharnum> that says to me there\'s an issue somewhere with the scheduler/model/event behaviour when Web Speech isn\'t available
2016-02-11T13:40:52 * jhung joined the channel
2016-02-11T13:41:47 <cindyli> alanharnum: so we could potentially detect is the text to speech is available before running those tests. if not, don\'t run
2016-02-11T13:42:18 <cindyli> alanharnum: also nice to figure out the issue with safari
2016-02-11T13:42:33 <avtar> gtirloni: just to confirm, this was with  the \'grunt tests\' task?
2016-02-11T13:42:50 <cindyli> typo, "if", not "is"
2016-02-11T13:43:22 <alanharnum> cindyli: given the functionality at the code level, some of the tests should run because it can still play the sounds even if the Speech API isn\'t available
2016-02-11T13:43:37 <cindyli> ah. ok
2016-02-11T13:43:54 <alanharnum> i also suspect this won\'t be an issue for too much longer because if Web Speech is at the "enable via about:config" level in FF, it should probably be on by default soon
2016-02-11T13:44:18 <gtirloni> avtar: no, building infusion, unzipping, opening all-tests.html
2016-02-11T13:44:29 * ayushdatta joined the channel
2016-02-11T13:44:52 <cindyli> alanharnum: would IE still be an issue? is IE intended to support text to speech soon?
2016-02-11T13:45:18 <alanharnum> the safari issue is odder - i assume you mean the way safari won\'t consistently play the sounds
2016-02-11T13:45:28 <alanharnum> i suspect that\'s a browser bug myself
2016-02-11T13:46:52 <alanharnum> cindyli: I\'m not sure - it\'s not supported right now according to caniuse
2016-02-11T13:47:27 <alanharnum> cindyli: here\'s a recent MS update: https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2016/02/03/2016-platform-priorities/
2016-02-11T13:47:35 <alanharnum> "We\xe2\x80\x99re also investigating longer term investments like the Web Speech API and script-based accessibility. We plan to share more details about our accessibility improvements in future posts on the topic."
2016-02-11T13:48:08 * Bosmon7 joined the channel
2016-02-11T13:48:13 <alanharnum> "investigating longer term investments" sounds like "we don\'t think we\'ll do this any time soon, but we won\'t say that openly" to me, but maybe that\'s me being cynical
2016-02-11T13:48:16 <avtar> gtirloni: to test with that branch you\'ll have to enter your sauce labs creds in a \'provisioning/secrets.yml\' file, vagrant up, and then \'grunt tests\' on the host
2016-02-11T13:48:38 <cindyli> alanharnum: ya, sounds like an "unknown" :)
2016-02-11T13:49:10 <gtirloni> fluid-everyone -- FYI: since Jan 2016, IE11 is the only supported version of IE for Windows 7, 8.1 and 10 -- https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle#gp/Microsoft-Internet-Explorer
2016-02-11T13:49:13 <gtirloni> avtar: ok
2016-02-11T13:50:05 <cindyli> thanks for letting us know, gtirloni
2016-02-11T13:50:31 <alanharnum> that\'s an interesting blog post in general about MS plans for Edge
2016-02-11T13:50:43 <alanharnum> and from last week, so quite current
2016-02-11T13:51:49 <gtirloni> all tests pass on edge, excep InlineEdit (FLUID-5862).. we seem to be in good shape for it
2016-02-11T13:52:27 <avtar> gtirloni: looks like i have none of those details in the readme
2016-02-11T13:52:41 <alanharnum> here\'s a recent FF update on the web speech API: https://hacks.mozilla.org/2016/01/firefox-and-the-web-speech-api/
2016-02-11T13:53:15 * alanharnum wonders how hard / well-supported the speech recognition functionality in chrome/ff actually is
2016-02-11T13:54:22 * michelled joined the channel
2016-02-11T13:58:32 <alanharnum> there is a part of me that thinks a cool multimodal interaction would be to support play/stop via voice command, or editing the chart by voice
2016-02-11T13:58:58 <alanharnum> but i have no clue about the speech recognition side of the API without further research - have we ever had cause to explore that in other projects?

2016-02-11T14:05:41 * simonjb joined the channel
2016-02-11T14:05:43 <Justin_o> lots of chatter in the channel this morning :)
2016-02-11T14:06:18 <Justin_o> alanharnum, cindyli: there should be some code for feature detecting the speech synthesis in infusion already, we needed that for text-to-speech
2016-02-11T14:06:18 * ayushdatta has quit
2016-02-11T14:06:34 <Justin_o> maybe that\'ll help with your situation
2016-02-11T14:06:37 <alanharnum> Justin_o: yeah, that\'s used in the chartAuthoring tool
2016-02-11T14:07:37 <alanharnum> we detect and don\'t use the speech API (just the web audio one) if speech isn\'t available
2016-02-11T14:08:05 <alanharnum> the specific issue is that some of the tests don\'t pass when they should
2016-02-11T14:08:47 <Justin_o> alanharnum: they should be running, but are failing?
2016-02-11T14:08:54 <alanharnum> so at some level there\'s a mismatch between the component scheduling of sound plays when speech isn\'t available and the model changes that are observed to test
2016-02-11T14:09:01 <Justin_o> gtirloni: thanks for all the JIRAs, i\'ll take a look at those today
2016-02-11T14:09:22 <alanharnum> they\'re running, but the sounds are playing in (seemingly) the wrong sequence, causing the test to fail
2016-02-11T14:09:39 <alanharnum> we also don\'t see the same behaviour in the demo, where the sounds play in the expected order
2016-02-11T14:10:22 <alanharnum> it\'s probably something pretty straightforward (I suspect a logical gap in model changes when TTS isn\'t available, as at this point the scheduling is largely driven by model changes)
2016-02-11T14:10:35 <Justin_o> alanharnum: i\'d guess it may have something to do with asynchrony and the test harness.. perhaps you are having sounds playing still when a new test starts.. but i think you said this only happens in the case when the web speech api isn\'t available, so not sure how you are testing it

2016-02-11T14:14:24 * kasparnet has quit
2016-02-11T14:14:57 <alanharnum> Justin_o: the asynchrony definitely makes it a little complex - i say it\'s probably a scheduling mismatch because most of what the test harness is listening for is model changes that are triggered by the scheduler, and the scheduler works slightly differently when TTS isn\'t in the mix

2016-02-11T14:16:22 * kasparnet joined the channel
2016-02-11T14:17:02 <Justin_o> alanharnum: is it mocked out?
2016-02-11T14:17:38 <alanharnum> Justin_o: uncertain what you mean
2016-02-11T14:17:48 <Justin_o> I think i had to make my TTS Mock asynchronous to get it to behave more like the real thing
2016-02-11T14:18:01 <Justin_o> wondering if you are mocking something when the TTS isn\'t available
2016-02-11T14:18:05 <Justin_o> alanharnum: ^
2016-02-11T14:18:08 <alanharnum> nope
2016-02-11T14:18:20 <alanharnum> but the scheduler is supposed to accomodate TTS not being available
2016-02-11T14:18:26 <Justin_o> alanharnum: so i guess i don\'t know how you\'re testing it still :)
2016-02-11T14:18:28 <Justin_o> oh okay
2016-02-11T14:18:32 * kasparnet has quit
2016-02-11T14:18:36 <alanharnum> and does in the perceivable sense, at least in the demo
2016-02-11T14:18:48 * kasparnet joined the channel
2016-02-11T14:19:00 <Justin_o> i feel like i\'m not providing you with any help, sorry :(
2016-02-11T14:19:11 <alanharnum> no this is actually really helpful
2016-02-11T14:19:18 <alanharnum> it\'s helping focus my thoughts
2016-02-11T14:19:25 <alanharnum> although i should probably be writing instead :p
2016-02-11T14:22:02 <alanharnum> michelled cindyli: thoughts on https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLOE-452? It would be quick to update this today so the overlay panel text is up to date before next week, but would need someone to merge.
2016-02-11T14:24:09 <Justin_o> alanharnum: i\'ll stop bothering you then so you can get to writing ;)
2016-02-11T14:24:16 <alanharnum> Justin_o: haha
2016-02-11T14:24:23 <alanharnum> i\'m a willing participant :p
2016-02-11T14:24:31 <Justin_o> :)
2016-02-11T14:24:47 <alanharnum> some of my writing process involves resisting the writing process until it starts to cascade
2016-02-11T14:24:57 <alanharnum> rather like stretching a rubber band until it snaps
2016-02-11T14:25:03 <cindyli> alanharnum: i can help with merging the pull request for 452
2016-02-11T14:25:12 <michelled> sounds like a good idea to me
2016-02-11T14:25:26 <alanharnum> cindyli: ok, great - i\'ll draft some text and it can be reviewed / edited as part of the PR
2016-02-11T14:25:35 <cindyli> sure. thanks, alanharnum
