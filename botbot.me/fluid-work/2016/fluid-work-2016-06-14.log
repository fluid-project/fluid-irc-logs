b'2016-06-14T22:32:34 <gtirloni> ah, awesome.. javi\'s comment is perfect
2016-06-14T22:32:49 <gtirloni> no-brainer is my comfort zone
2016-06-14T22:33:13 <avtar> colinclark: i remember reading "somewhere" that we will probably need to switch to a 32-bit version of python to match a 32-bit node installation
2016-06-14T22:33:20 <colinclark> I guess the ultimate fix, gtirloni, will be to look into porting our FFI stuff to Edge.js
2016-06-14T22:33:24 <colinclark> assuming it is viable
2016-06-14T22:33:29 <colinclark> we discussed this a bit last week
2016-06-14T22:33:35 <colinclark> avtar: ah, fascinating

2016-06-14T22:37:26 <colinclark> jhernandez_: I just talked to avtar
2016-06-14T22:37:34 <jhernandez_> avtar: I\'m using node 37bit on our windows box, which I assume it uses a 61bit python
2016-06-14T22:37:35 <colinclark> and he said he\'d make a pull request with the provisioning changes
2016-06-14T22:37:43 <jhernandez_> :P
2016-06-14T22:37:48 <colinclark> hahaha
2016-06-14T22:37:55 <colinclark> so if you want to try it out tomorrow morning, that\'d be cool
2016-06-14T22:38:00 <colinclark> and if you\'re confident, go ahead and merge it
2016-06-14T22:38:10 <colinclark> otherwise I can, later in your day tomorrow

b'2016-06-14T19:37:50 <Bosmon> Just put "port" in the termMap itself
2016-06-14T19:37:59 <cindyli> ok, cool
2016-06-14T19:38:24 <cindyli> my debugging on "requestOptions.url" shows: %baseUrl/%dbName/%userId
2016-06-14T19:38:29 <avtar> regarding a) i\'m assuming you mean do we want the ability for now since the long-term plan seems to be use one installer for the framework and the listeners
2016-06-14T19:38:43 <cindyli> Bosmon: let\'s use fluid-tech
2016-06-14T19:39:00 <colinclark> avtar: yup
2016-06-14T19:39:23 <avtar> that one installer could have an option which would let someone opt out of installing the listeners
2016-06-14T19:43:31 <avtar> colinclark: https://github.com/GPII/windows/blob/f0d2b57ce09eecc435d45761d69c12ca5796f7e4/listeners/installer/Installer.vcxproj#L32
2016-06-14T19:45:59 <avtar> i\'m assuming inno setup has been used manually to create installers for the listeners
2016-06-14T19:47:15 <avtar> it seems useful to set it up and make changes to the path if these VMs should be used to continue building installers, albeit manually

2016-06-14T19:53:44 <avtar> looks like automating that process with the build tools already in place in the vm shouldn\'t be a lot of work
2016-06-14T19:53:51 <colinclark> ah, ok
2016-06-14T19:53:57 <colinclark> It\'s something we can ask minogian to do
2016-06-14T19:54:02 <colinclark> if you know what specifically we should ask for
2016-06-14T19:55:04 <avtar> do you think that needs to be a separate task or a request for pr #71?
2016-06-14T19:57:25 * alanharn_ joined the channel
2016-06-14T20:00:39 <colinclark> my impression is that #71 should cover anything related to successful builds
2016-06-14T20:00:48 <colinclark> and all pull requests should now be compatible with our CI system
2016-06-14T20:01:05 <colinclark> for the listeners, that is
2016-06-14T20:02:56 <avtar> ok
2016-06-14T20:03:19 <colinclark> You needn\'t do anything here, in particular, avtar

2016-06-14T20:03:25 <colinclark> just if you have any comments to add to the pull request
2016-06-14T20:03:42 <avtar> yeah, i\'m just going to add a request to that pr
2016-06-14T20:03:47 <colinclark> thanks
2016-06-14T20:03:57 <colinclark> I think other than that, I\'m happy with it
2016-06-14T20:04:49 <colinclark> On another note, avtar, and only when you have time to answer...
2016-06-14T20:05:07 <colinclark> I stumbled across a branch you worked on for Infusion that added sauce labs support to testem a while ago
2016-06-14T20:05:17 <colinclark> Is this something you think we\'ll still want to do some day?
2016-06-14T20:05:33 <colinclark> and if someone were looking for examples of how to do so for other projects, is your branch a good starting point?

2016-06-14T21:42:41 <jhernandez_> Bosmon: why do you find them insteresting? any thoughts? Ale thinks that it\'s not ffi
2016-06-14T21:43:54 <Bosmon> jhernandez_ well, they are a little unexpected
2016-06-14T21:44:08 <Bosmon> That is, the observation that 32-bit node works on all platforms
2016-06-14T21:44:17 <avtar> hey jhernandez_
2016-06-14T21:44:19 <avtar> good timing
2016-06-14T21:44:23 <Bosmon> Which, to be honest, was a kind of subconscious expectation that caused me to only ever work with 32 bit node :)
2016-06-14T21:44:36 <avtar> jhernandez_: https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-1838?focusedCommentId=19514&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-19514
2016-06-14T21:44:41 <Bosmon> But what is the answer to colinclark \'s question - I assume the process killing doesn\'t work right with the 32-bit node?
2016-06-14T21:44:44 <Bosmon> Just the SPI API?
2016-06-14T21:45:55 <avtar> i was wondering if you\'ve had to launch processes remotely over ssh using that dbus env var of a logged in user
2016-06-14T21:46:01 <avtar> jhernandez_ ^
2016-06-14T21:52:05 <jhernandez_> Bosmon: the killing process does work on 32bit node
2016-06-14T21:52:42 <colinclark> jhernandez_: ALL the test pass on 32 bit?
2016-06-14T21:52:48 <colinclark> like GREEN BARS ALL AROUND?
2016-06-14T21:52:56 <jhernandez_> yup
2016-06-14T21:52:59 <colinclark> wowza
2016-06-14T21:53:04 <jhernandez_> well, builtIn
2016-06-14T21:53:05 <jhernandez_> so, yes
2016-06-14T21:53:09 <colinclark> right
2016-06-14T21:54:47 <jhernandez_> I guess that we can say "64bit isn\'t fully supported *by now*", isn\'t it?
2016-06-14T21:58:08 <colinclark> well, i guess the GPII will run on Bosmon\'s mom\'s computer
2016-06-14T21:58:11 <colinclark> we know that much
2016-06-14T21:58:32 <jhernandez_> avtar: I think I\'ve made something similar in the past, but have to double check
2016-06-14T21:59:19 <colinclark> but I guess not a lot of other people run 32-bit windows 10?
2016-06-14T22:00:13 <jhernandez_> colinclark: I\'m talking about node
2016-06-14T22:00:23 <colinclark> oh yes
2016-06-14T22:00:24 <colinclark> that\'s right
2016-06-14T22:00:33 <colinclark> because you found everything worked in any variation that included 32 bit Node.js
2016-06-14T22:01:00 <colinclark> So why did gloob think it wasn\'t FFI-related?
2016-06-14T22:08:16 <jhernandez_> colinclark: gloob mentioned something about macro and type conversions related issues, but not necessarily in ffi
2016-06-14T22:08:40 * alanharnum joined the channel
2016-06-14T22:08:55 <colinclark> Well, I guess in the worst case scenario we can change our supported version of Node.js
2016-06-14T22:09:00 <colinclark> to 32-bit
2016-06-14T22:09:13 <colinclark> I don\'t know if there are other practical considerations with this
2016-06-14T22:09:22 <jhernandez_> in any case, I\'ll ask him whether he has any ideas to keep investigating
2016-06-14T22:10:59 <jhernandez_> colinclark: well,I guess that besides documentation, updating the provisioning of our windows 10 box to use a 32bit version of node.js
2016-06-14T22:11:10 <colinclark> yeah
2016-06-14T22:14:21 <colinclark> avtar: is it possible to provision 32-bit versions of node using our current setup?
2016-06-14T22:14:31 <colinclark> or do we only include 64-bit?
2016-06-14T22:15:01 * Jess_ has quit

2016-06-14T22:15:31 <avtar> we can switch back to 32-bit versions
2016-06-14T22:15:37 <jhernandez_> colinclark: I don\'t think it\'s a problem
2016-06-14T22:16:04 <colinclark> my impression is that we should
2016-06-14T22:16:08 <colinclark> at least for a while
2016-06-14T22:16:14 <colinclark> passing tests are better than failing tests
2016-06-14T22:16:28 <colinclark> it sounds like we still have some research to do, though
2016-06-14T22:18:05 <jhernandez_> re "passing tests are better than failing tests" I agree
2016-06-14T22:18:27 <colinclark> I sort of can\'t believe that was 18 days ago, avtar
2016-06-14T22:18:34 <colinclark> what happened to time?
2016-06-14T22:18:40 <colinclark> wasn\'t that just like a week ago?
2016-06-14T22:18:42 <colinclark> :)
2016-06-14T22:19:07 <avtar> i can\'t even remember what i did yesterday...
2016-06-14T22:19:23 <colinclark> it\'s not still yesterday?
2016-06-14T22:19:29 <jhernandez_> avtar: I can\'t even remember what I\'ve just eaten
2016-06-14T22:19:32 <jhernandez_> xDDD
2016-06-14T22:23:32 <gtirloni> does it mean tests pass but it doesn\'t work on developer\'s machines?
2016-06-14T22:24:01 <gtirloni> sorry to be the party pooper but i get a bad feeling about switching our stuff to 32-bit
2016-06-14T22:24:32 <avtar> gtirloni: no, the test isn\'t passing at all at the moment
2016-06-14T22:24:58 <gtirloni> but switching to 32-bit makes it pass, right?
2016-06-14T22:25:40 <colinclark> gtirloni: no
2016-06-14T22:25:54 <colinclark> At the moment the system is, as kasparnet would say, "broke"
2016-06-14T22:26:01 <colinclark> both the tests and the real deal
2016-06-14T22:26:11 <colinclark> To be honest, it gives me a bad feeling, too
2016-06-14T22:26:12 <avtar> gtirloni: http://pastie.org/pastes/10877016/text
2016-06-14T22:26:13 <gtirloni> i misunderstood then (and now i have no clue why we are considering 32-bit, or if we are considering 32-bit at all.. haha)
2016-06-14T22:26:14 <avtar> https://ci.gpii.net/job/windows-unit-tests/4/console.html
2016-06-14T22:26:28 <colinclark> gtirloni: well, we are considering 32-bit node
2016-06-14T22:26:34 <colinclark> in the sense that we know our system works with it on Windows
2016-06-14T22:26:41 <colinclark> but I\'d love to hear your bad feelings
2016-06-14T22:26:58 <colinclark> I mean, there\'s clearly a problem in the system that needs to be fixed
2016-06-14T22:26:58 <avtar> colinclark: you don\'t want gtirloni to start listing his bad feelings........
2016-06-14T22:27:08 <colinclark> hahaha
2016-06-14T22:27:43 <gtirloni> my bad feelings are of a more practical nature.. nodejs.org\'s default downloads are all 64-bit, there is no 64-bit version for macosx, the linux distros will all default to install 64-bit pkgs too and who\'s using 32-bit in 2016? ok, the last is more on the subjective side
2016-06-14T22:27:44 <gtirloni> :)
2016-06-14T22:27:55 <gtirloni> it\'s true, you don\'t :~(
2016-06-14T22:28:33 <gtirloni> s/no 64-bit version for macosx/no 32-bit version for macosx/g
2016-06-14T22:28:48 <colinclark> gtirloni: Yes, I agree with all those points
2016-06-14T22:28:55 <colinclark> fortunately the bug only exists on Windows
2016-06-14T22:29:03 <colinclark> so in the immediate sense, your points are moot
2016-06-14T22:29:15 <colinclark> in the global sense, they are right on the mark :)
2016-06-14T22:29:33 <colinclark> I suppose I\'m saying something to the effect of...
2016-06-14T22:29:43 <gtirloni> ah, only on windows. i already expected to be missing some clues.. that makes sense
2016-06-14T22:30:05 <colinclark> "I propose that we move to officially support only 32-bit Node.js on Windows, until we can fully diagnose and fix the problem with 64-bit versions."
2016-06-14T22:30:24 <Bosmon> colinclark - I propose that that is what could be called a "no-brainer" : P
2016-06-14T22:30:29 <colinclark> hahaha
2016-06-14T22:30:34 <gtirloni> got it
2016-06-14T22:30:36 <colinclark> bwains
2016-06-14T22:30:42 <Bosmon> BWAINS!
2016-06-14T22:30:57 <colinclark> I have to hit the road shortly
2016-06-14T22:31:05 <jhernandez_> xDDDDDDD
2016-06-14T22:31:06 <colinclark> but it\'s a marvellously easy pull request to make and test
2016-06-14T22:31:10 <avtar> yes
2016-06-14T22:31:18 <colinclark> I\'m happy to a) make the PR tomorrow
2016-06-14T22:31:19 <colinclark> or better yet
2016-06-14T22:31:27 <colinclark> b) review and merge it from someone else
2016-06-14T22:31:43 <colinclark> and then gtirloni can -1 it :)
2016-06-14T22:31:45 <gtirloni> last question: is it fine on Win10 64-bit + Node.js 32-bit.. is that right?
2016-06-14T22:31:54 <colinclark> gtirloni: so it appears, yes
2016-06-14T22:31:59 <gtirloni> cool!
2016-06-14T22:32:08 <gtirloni> i\'ll definitely +1 since it\'s a "no-brainer"

2016-06-14T15:19:06 <avtar> colinclark, gtirloni: regarding potential fluid ci changes, i think we (i will) should make the change to infusion\'s jjb definition since that can be done today
2016-06-14T15:20:52 <avtar> then we (me mainly but getting opinions from others with ci-as-a-service experience would be helpful) should ideally evaluate the new jenkins 2.* pipelines way of tackling workloads and make the decision to either adopt it or continue with our own multijob builder approach

2016-06-14T15:21:57 <colinclark> so the two really go together
2016-06-14T15:23:11 <Justin_o> colinclark: cool.. i\'ll merge this one in now
2016-06-14T15:23:17 <colinclark> awesome!
2016-06-14T15:26:24 <Justin_o> colinclark: merged
2016-06-14T15:26:29 <colinclark> thanks!

2016-06-14T15:55:50 <colinclark> gtirloni, avtar: I\'ve merged Bosmon\'s fix for our sporadically failing unit tests. And Justin_o has merged my updates to the Vagrant environment, so I think we\'re in good shape to update the ci-service to actually build the VM and run "grunt tests" in it.
2016-06-14T15:55:56 <colinclark> Which is exciting :)

2016-06-14T18:55:34 <Bosmon> jhernandez_ - the results of your 73-bit tests are really interesting

2016-06-14T19:11:33 <cindyli> hi Bosmon, do u have time to help with a pouchdb unit test?
2016-06-14T19:12:51 <cindyli> i\'m writing a unit test using gpii-pouchdb for this invoker - https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/GPII-1274/gpii/node_modules/gpii-oauth2/gpii-oauth2-datastore/src/DbDataStore.js#L107
2016-06-14T19:13:04 <cindyli> the test: https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/GPII-1274/gpii/node_modules/gpii-oauth2/gpii-oauth2-datastore/test/DbDataStoreTests.js#L111
2016-06-14T19:13:45 <cindyli> the invoker is implemented with kettle.dataSource.couchDB
2016-06-14T19:15:28 <cindyli> the problem i\'m having is the response is "record not found". i checked the data by sending a direct request to the pouchdb, IT IS THERE! the data is imported successfully
2016-06-14T19:17:15 <cindyli> the test that sends a direct request - https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/GPII-1274/gpii/node_modules/gpii-oauth2/gpii-oauth2-datastore/test/DbDataStoreTests.js#L138-L155 (it is commented out in the fluid.test.runTests())
2016-06-14T19:17:22 <cindyli> at line 159
2016-06-14T19:17:47 <cindyli> can u help me to figure out what I missed or didn\'t do correctly?
2016-06-14T19:25:57 <Bosmon> cindyli - can\'t see anything special
2016-06-14T19:26:02 <Bosmon> Perhaps you didn\'t encode the key correctly?
2016-06-14T19:26:16 <cindyli> what key?
2016-06-14T19:26:39 <Bosmon> https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/GPII-1274/gpii/node_modules/gpii-oauth2/gpii-oauth2-datastore/test/DbDataStoreTests.js#L91
2016-06-14T19:26:40 <Bosmon> This one
2016-06-14T19:27:14 <colinclark> Hey avtar, when this pull request goes in, do you think we should automatically build the listeners as part of CI, too? https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/71/files
2016-06-14T19:27:30 <cindyli> Bosmon: this invoker uses the path at 86 - "/gpiiOauth/user-1"
2016-06-14T19:27:51 <cindyli> the simplest form, it doesn\'t needs to be encoded
2016-06-14T19:27:54 <colinclark> I gather, depressingly, that there are no unit tests to accompany them, avtar, but at least build failures would be good to know about, right?
2016-06-14T19:28:43 <avtar> colinclark: yes, getting the ci server to build them makes sense
2016-06-14T19:28:46 <colinclark> or, I guess, this pull request will actually build these as part of CI?
2016-06-14T19:28:56 <colinclark> since he\'s modified the provisioning/build.bat file too
2016-06-14T19:29:04 <Bosmon> cindyli - it\'s a bit confusing
2016-06-14T19:29:08 <Bosmon> YOu seem to have two unrelated tests?
2016-06-14T19:29:14 <Bosmon> Is the one you\'re talking about the one you have commented out?
2016-06-14T19:29:16 <cindyli> exactly :)
2016-06-14T19:29:28 <Bosmon> Can you tell me which test you are interested in?
2016-06-14T19:29:40 <cindyli> no, the one gives the problem is https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/GPII-1274/gpii/node_modules/gpii-oauth2/gpii-oauth2-datastore/test/DbDataStoreTests.js#L158
2016-06-14T19:29:45 * alanharnum has quit
2016-06-14T19:29:52 <Bosmon> ok
2016-06-14T19:29:56 <Bosmon> that one that is not commented out
2016-06-14T19:30:00 <avtar> colinclark: yup
2016-06-14T19:30:03 <cindyli> the commented one is to check the data in the pouch
2016-06-14T19:30:09 <cindyli> yes, exactly, Bosmon
2016-06-14T19:30:15 <avtar> jhernandez_: ping
2016-06-14T19:31:02 * wale has quit
2016-06-14T19:31:32 <colinclark> avtar: This pull request is somewhat interesting, in that it also installs inno setup and adds it to the path: https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/71/files#diff-44f052772997958cbf7a4737817f01b5R3
2016-06-14T19:31:55 <colinclark> I guess when slim wrote these new listeners, he also built an installer for them
2016-06-14T19:32:04 <Bosmon> cindyli - I\'m not sure that the definition of the invoker is correct
2016-06-14T19:32:12 <cindyli> ah
2016-06-14T19:32:22 <Bosmon> https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/GPII-1274/gpii/node_modules/gpii-oauth2/gpii-oauth2-datastore/src/DbDataStore.js#L56
2016-06-14T19:32:30 <Bosmon> Isn\'t it expecting the userId to be in a model field named "userId"?
2016-06-14T19:32:40 <Bosmon> But, I\'m sure, that you would have seen the URL that it makes a request to in the diagnostics
2016-06-14T19:32:44 <Bosmon> Do you have logging turned on?
2016-06-14T19:33:06 <cindyli> i have some log that shows the kettle is using the url
2016-06-14T19:33:13 <cindyli> the right url, sorry
2016-06-14T19:33:36 <Bosmon> I guess it doesn\'t actually log the final interpolated URL itself
2016-06-14T19:33:37 <Bosmon> https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/GPII-1274/gpii/node_modules/gpii-oauth2/gpii-oauth2-datastore/src/DbDataStore.js#L56
2016-06-14T19:33:40 <Bosmon> oops
2016-06-14T19:33:47 <cindyli> that\'s possible
2016-06-14T19:33:49 <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/blob/master/lib/dataSource-node.js#L309
2016-06-14T19:34:12 <Bosmon> Well, I guess it does
2016-06-14T19:34:17 <Bosmon> The log at this line should tell you the final URL
2016-06-14T19:34:18 <cindyli> smart Bosmon, that\'s the first issue i worked around. might be related but i\'m not sure
2016-06-14T19:34:22 <Bosmon> I imagine it will have userId missing
2016-06-14T19:34:31 <Bosmon> Since you don\'t supply it in the correct place in the arguments
2016-06-14T19:34:31 <avtar> hmm so the framework doesn\'t use inno setup for its installer, just the listeners?
2016-06-14T19:34:35 <avtar> colinclark: ^
2016-06-14T19:34:43 <colinclark> yeah
2016-06-14T19:34:58 <cindyli> i will try that again, Bosmon, the issue i worked around is to provide this line - https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/GPII-1274/gpii/node_modules/gpii-oauth2/gpii-oauth2-datastore/test/DbDataStoreTests.js#L79
2016-06-14T19:34:58 <colinclark> and I believe our plan will be to ship the listeners with the new installer
2016-06-14T19:35:11 <colinclark> and eventually to fold the listeners directly into the core GPII "app"
2016-06-14T19:35:32 <cindyli> otherwise, the line of https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/blob/master/lib/dataSource-node.js#L309 complains "requestOptions.protocol is undefined"
2016-06-14T19:35:41 <colinclark> so the question is, a) do we still want the ability to create an installer for only the listeners and b) do we want to do so as part of the continuous integration process
2016-06-14T19:35:48 <colinclark> I don\'t exactly know the answer to a) yet
2016-06-14T19:35:57 <colinclark> my impression with b) is that it may not be necessary
2016-06-14T19:36:19 <cindyli> is that normal, Bosmon, not sure if it\'s related to the "record not found" problem. adding the debugging log to check url
2016-06-14T19:36:28 <colinclark> especially since, as I read this, we don\'t actually build the installers
2016-06-14T19:36:31 <Bosmon> cindyli - you are sort of misusing the dataSource expansion system
2016-06-14T19:36:34 <colinclark> we only install inno setup and put it in the path
2016-06-14T19:36:58 <Bosmon> This complex termMap with an expander in it is unncessary: https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/GPII-1274/gpii/node_modules/gpii-oauth2/gpii-oauth2-datastore/test/DbDataStoreTests.js#L68
2016-06-14T19:37:26 <cindyli> oh, what\'s the right way to re-use "port" option?

2016-06-14T14:38:40 <Justin_o> colinclark: i think so, i\'ll send you a link privately
2016-06-14T14:39:30 <colinclark> thanks Justin_o
2016-06-14T14:43:28 * anvk has quit

2016-06-14T14:46:06 <Justin_o> colinclark: I was talking to michelled and alanharn_ a bit yesterday about prefsFramework performance work..
2016-06-14T14:46:28 <colinclark> yes
2016-06-14T14:47:49 <Justin_o> colinclark: i\'m not exactly sure what the next thing to tackle in that regard after FLUD-5892, but i\'m thinking CSS improvements ( including reducing complexity, minifying, concatenating, and etc.) and upgrading to jQuery 2.x and maybe stripping out browser specific hacks from Infusion
2016-06-14T14:48:19 <colinclark> I think I\'d recommend talking with alanharnum about it
2016-06-14T14:48:26 <colinclark> since he did the first round
2016-06-14T14:48:43 <colinclark> The focus should largely be on load times, as far as I can tell
2016-06-14T14:48:54 <colinclark> What version of jQuery are we currently using?
2016-06-14T14:49:00 <colinclark> Are we still back on 1.9.x?
2016-06-14T14:49:29 <colinclark> avtar, Justin_o: I\'m puzzled by why the Infusion builds pass :)
2016-06-14T14:49:47 <colinclark> I guess they must not provision a vagrant box at all?
2016-06-14T14:49:55 <Justin_o> colinclark: 1.11.x i believe
2016-06-14T14:49:57 <colinclark> I\'m sure I remember something about htis
2016-06-14T14:50:56 <Justin_o> colinclark: if build question is about unit tests, i\'m not sure they are being run with the builds yet.. although don\'t know if that\'s changed since we last talked about it
2016-06-14T14:51:07 <colinclark> The question is not quite about unit tests
2016-06-14T14:51:12 <colinclark> but I guess the two are related
2016-06-14T14:51:19 <colinclark> I just made this pull request: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/719
2016-06-14T14:51:29 <colinclark> I was reviewing Bosmon\'s fix to the sporadic QUnit failures we see
2016-06-14T14:51:42 <colinclark> and realized that I couldn\'t successfully provision a Vagrant box to run the Infusion tests in
2016-06-14T14:51:51 <colinclark> so I thought "Let\'s see what\'s up with the builds!"
2016-06-14T14:51:58 <colinclark> and after just triggering one manually, they all bpass
2016-06-14T14:52:00 <colinclark> pass
2016-06-14T14:52:17 <Justin_o> colinclark: regarding UIO performance, I talked with alan a bit yesterday and both those things i was mentioning were regarding load times, sort of. 1) being to reduce the size of files loaded, and 2) for the css specifically to reduce the number of files loaded as well. I don\'t know how much of a gain we\'ll get though.
2016-06-14T14:52:18 <colinclark> so I guess this tells me that the Infusion builds don\'t really do much more than maybe run the build scripts somewhere?
2016-06-14T14:52:47 <colinclark> Justin_o: My impression is that we still need to consider lazily-loading UIO
2016-06-14T14:52:49 <Justin_o> colinclark: yes, and probably deploy the code used by the build site
2016-06-14T14:52:53 <colinclark> as a configurable option
2016-06-14T14:52:56 <colinclark> Justin_o: Ok, cool
2016-06-14T14:53:02 <colinclark> at least I know why we don\'t have failures
2016-06-14T14:53:18 * alanharnum joined the channel
2016-06-14T14:53:23 <colinclark> I think once my pull request and Bosmon\'s gets merged, we should switch to actually provisioning a box and running the tests
2016-06-14T14:53:32 <colinclark> Justin_o: Do you feel like reviewing this one for me? :)
2016-06-14T14:53:35 <colinclark> It\'s an easy one to test
2016-06-14T14:53:41 <gtirloni> colinclark, not running tests, that\'s correct -- https://github.com/fluid-project/ci-service/blob/master/jenkins_jobs/fluid-infusion.yml#L15-L16
2016-06-14T14:53:55 <colinclark> gtirloni: aha, perfect
2016-06-14T14:53:59 <colinclark> I was going to ask where I could see this
2016-06-14T14:54:34 <colinclark> gtirloni: Is there a deployment step here at all
2016-06-14T14:54:35 <Justin_o> colinclark: sure, which PR is it?
2016-06-14T14:54:49 <colinclark> This one, Justin_o: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/719
2016-06-14T14:55:05 <colinclark> Two steps to test, I think
2016-06-14T14:55:07 <colinclark> vagrant destroy -f
2016-06-14T14:55:09 <colinclark> and vagrant up
2016-06-14T14:55:20 <gtirloni> colinclark, yeah, the SSH publisher will copy the build results to the server
2016-06-14T14:55:21 <colinclark> and then for good measure, you can run "grunt tests"
2016-06-14T14:55:25 <colinclark> gtirloni: aha, ok
2016-06-14T14:55:50 <Justin_o> colinclark: cool that shouldn\'t be too difficult :)
2016-06-14T14:55:58 <colinclark> gtirloni: How will this have to change if we want to run the tests in a Vagrant box as part of this process?
2016-06-14T14:56:07 <colinclark> Justin_o: Yeah, just a little boring
2016-06-14T14:56:18 <colinclark> since you have to sit and wait for the box to provision and the tests to run
2016-06-14T14:57:03 <gtirloni> colinclark, we\'d have to check if infusion\'s Vagrantfiles is okay.. in the same way as GPII\'s.. then this CI definition needs to change to have steps for building, testing, etc. Like avtar has done for GPII... no other infrastructure changes are needed
2016-06-14T14:57:21 <colinclark> gtirloni: It looks pretty good to me
2016-06-14T14:57:30 <colinclark> Can you show me what the ci configuration for GPII universal looks like?
2016-06-14T14:57:36 <colinclark> I think Infusion is now very similar
2016-06-14T14:57:42 <gtirloni> let me check
2016-06-14T14:58:06 * kasparnet joined the channel
2016-06-14T14:58:35 <gtirloni> colinclark, something like this but with a few steps trimmed off -- https://github.com/GPII/ci-service/blob/master/jenkins_jobs/universal.yml
2016-06-14T14:58:57 <gtirloni> i can talk to avtar and double-check this but i guess that\'d be all
2016-06-14T14:59:00 <colinclark> yup, this looks very close
2016-06-14T14:59:18 <colinclark> In fact I can imagine we can factor out a base...
2016-06-14T14:59:20 <colinclark> what do you call this?
2016-06-14T14:59:22 <colinclark> job?
2016-06-14T14:59:24 <colinclark> recipe?
2016-06-14T14:59:26 <colinclark> playbook?
2016-06-14T14:59:34 <gtirloni> that one is the job definition
2016-06-14T14:59:48 <colinclark> can one inherit from or somehow use base job definitions?
2016-06-14T15:00:14 * michelled joined the channel
2016-06-14T15:00:14 <gtirloni> there is the concept of default settings, i think avtar used it for gpii yes
2016-06-14T15:00:35 <gtirloni> including something per se, relies on yaml\'s constructs (i think there is a keyword for including other file)
2016-06-14T15:00:43 <gtirloni> so it should be possible
2016-06-14T15:00:57 <colinclark> Justin_o: You\'ll have to remind me how to amend my commit log
2016-06-14T15:00:58 <gtirloni> what\'s your idea? a base definition and..?
2016-06-14T15:01:18 <colinclark> gtirloni: I\'m just thinking that the workflow is basically the same
2016-06-14T15:01:33 <colinclark> create the VM, run the browser tests
2016-06-14T15:01:40 <colinclark> delete the VM
2016-06-14T15:01:51 <colinclark> I guess these things are hard to compose in most environments
2016-06-14T15:02:03 <colinclark> since in the case of universal, you want to inject several additional steps in the workflow
2016-06-14T15:03:57 <gtirloni> yep. i think defaults settings wouldn\'t help here, they are mostly variables. hmm good question.. i\'m thinking this might better fit avtar\'s tool that reads the .qi.yml files and translates that into these job definitions

2016-06-14T15:04:13 <colinclark> yeah, makes sense, gtirloni
2016-06-14T15:04:31 * from-fluid-IRC joined the channel
2016-06-14T15:04:33 <colinclark> Justin_o: Is it as simple as a "git commit --amend" and then a force push to my branch?
2016-06-14T15:04:59 <Justin_o> colinclark: yep that should be it
2016-06-14T15:05:05 <colinclark> sweet
