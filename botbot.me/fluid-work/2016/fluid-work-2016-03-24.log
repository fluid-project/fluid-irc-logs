b'2016-03-24T16:19:07 <Justin_o> akshay: thanks for the update, i\'ll take a look today. Also just so you know, tomorrow is a holiday for us so you probably won\'t get any more feedback after today

2016-03-24T16:30:26 <akshay> yes I saw you saying that in the chat earlier, I\'m trying do whatever is left a little fast so that I can ask you if I have some questions.
2016-03-24T16:33:47 <Justin_o> akshay: thanks
2016-03-24T16:33:56 <Justin_o> cindyli: i\'ve made more changes to the pull request
2016-03-24T16:33:57 <dins> Hi michelled and simon
2016-03-24T16:34:21 <cindyli> ok. thanks, Justin_o.
2016-03-24T16:34:32 <dins> I just did the final proposal submission
2016-03-24T16:34:48 <dins> :)
2016-03-24T16:34:48 <michelled> dins: great!

2016-03-24T16:56:14 <cindyli> Justin_o: i\'ve merged ur 5880 pull request into the master, but one thing i noticed with my local docpad deployment is the svg diagram is not showing on the localization page
2016-03-24T16:56:28 <cindyli> does it show on ur computer, Justin_o
2016-03-24T16:58:32 <Justin_o> cindyli:  i removed the diagram from the repo
2016-03-24T16:58:39 <Justin_o> since we don\'t talk about hierarchy any more
2016-03-24T16:59:12 <cindyli> right, together with the graffle. thanks
2016-03-24T16:59:54 <Justin_o> yes, exactly

2016-03-24T17:10:20 <Justin_o> cindyli: did you publish the changes to the docs site?
2016-03-24T17:11:27 <cindyli> Justin_o: i\'ve run "docpad deploy-ghpages --env static", but the live site doesn\'t seem to be updated
2016-03-24T17:12:02 <Justin_o> cindyli: i think that deploys to the origin remote
2016-03-24T17:12:37 <cindyli> Justin_o: not to the upstream, is that what you mean?
2016-03-24T17:12:41 <Justin_o> so if you run that from your typical clone, it\'ll probably be deploying to your own doc pages site
2016-03-24T17:12:56 <Justin_o> cindyli: usually i\'ll pull down a new clone directly from the project repo and run the deploy command from that checkout
2016-03-24T17:13:46 <cindyli> Justin_o: ok, so that the origin is "the upstream in my dev folder"
2016-03-24T17:13:48 <cindyli> got it
2016-03-24T17:15:01 <Justin_o> we should fix this up at some point to be able to take in a remote as a command line argument. I\'m not sure how much control we have over that though

2016-03-24T21:25:15 <simonjb> excellent :) I have a question
2016-03-24T21:25:21 <cindyli> having trouble collecting payloads, need help from Bosmon7
2016-03-24T21:25:22 <cindyli> sure
2016-03-24T21:25:29 <cindyli> what\'s that
2016-03-24T21:25:45 <simonjb> what is the current recommended approach for infusion components that have a ui?
2016-03-24T21:26:10 <simonjb> am I right in thinking that it\'s best not to use rendererComponent?
2016-03-24T21:26:24 <simonjb> that is, some HTML
2016-03-24T21:26:48 <cindyli> i think it depends on what you intend to do with this component
2016-03-24T21:27:03 <cindyli> do you want to vidyo? if that\'s easier, simonjb
2016-03-24T21:27:13 <simonjb> ok, sure, thanks!

I would appreciate some help.
2016-03-24T14:05:05 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: that's okay, it's not something needed for the proposal, but something to consider if you are selected for the project

2016-03-24T15:48:28 <dins> Hi simonjb michelled
2016-03-24T15:48:51 <dins> I thought of improving the initial project I started
2016-03-24T15:50:28 <dins> so, priority wise, I thought of starting the piano
2016-03-24T15:50:40 <dins> what do you think
2016-03-24T15:51:32 <dins> or, is there anything I should start before that
2016-03-24T15:51:36 <dins> :)
2016-03-24T15:51:39 <michelled> dins: I think it would be better to continue to improve the controller that you have started work on
2016-03-24T15:52:04 <dins> the knob
2016-03-24T15:52:09 <michelled> sepidehshahi_: do you have some time to look at the controller that dins has made?
2016-03-24T15:52:29 <sepidehshahi_> sure michelled can you send me the link
2016-03-24T15:52:44 <michelled> dins: I'm not sure if you know sepidehshahi_, she is one of the interaction designers on our project
2016-03-24T15:52:54 <dins> ah
2016-03-24T15:53:05 <dins> thanks for introducing her to me
2016-03-24T15:53:09 <dins> https://github.com/Dinuka2013513/music-ctrls
2016-03-24T15:53:17 <dins> this is the url
2016-03-24T15:53:41 <sepidehshahi_> Hi dins, great to meet you. thanks for the url
2016-03-24T15:55:40 <michelled> hmmm\xe2\x80\xa6 dins I think that isn't going to be so helpful for sepidehshahi_  do you have some screen shots of what you've made?

2016-03-24T16:14:46 <dins> just try out if you can
