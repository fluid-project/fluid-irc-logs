2016-12-29T14:19:47 <the-t-in-rtf> I need to reuse some material from universal in import scripts (I use the XMLSettingsHandler).
2016-12-29T14:20:08 <the-t-in-rtf> It doesn\'t look like that is or can be published to npm, as there is another package that uses its stated name: https://www.npmjs.com/package/universal
2016-12-29T14:21:35 <the-t-in-rtf> I guess I can bring it in using a git hash or something, but I\'d like a clean way to pin to a particular released version.
2016-12-29T14:21:43 <the-t-in-rtf> Any thoughts?  @Bosmon?
2016-12-29T14:24:21 <the-t-in-rtf> linux/master uses:  "universal": "GPII/universal#1a3434d970cb484956eb18310683bdfe473123d6"
2016-12-29T14:26:21 <the-t-in-rtf> Looks like linux/master unfortunately points to a git hashed version of infusion itself, which might cause problems in resolving the correct infusion.
