b'2016-10-25T17:50:03 <simonjb> yeah, I doubt it\'s to do with infusion
2016-10-25T17:50:23 <simonjb> looks like an odd error
2016-10-25T17:50:43 <simonjb> looks like the stack trace is originating from the git client
2016-10-25T17:50:53 <simonjb> org.jenkinsci.plugins.gitclient.LegacyCompatibleGitAPIImpl.writeReplace(LegacyCompatibleGitAPIImpl.java:198)
2016-10-25T17:51:05 <simonjb> then java.text.SimpleDateFormat.<init>(SimpleDateFormat.java:580)
2016-10-25T17:51:12 <simonjb> and a request to get the time zone
2016-10-25T17:51:47 <Justin_o> avtar, simonjb: any resent updates to the server, maybe something broke or is missing from that
2016-10-25T17:52:15 <avtar> gtirloni might be able to comment on that, i think we\'re almost done with this interview

2016-10-25T18:23:06 <Justin_o> clown: do you know if orca has different keyboard shortcuts based on the system language?

2016-10-25T18:23:47 <Justin_o> clown: thanks
2016-10-25T18:24:15 <clown> your question is about localization, right Justin_o?
2016-10-25T18:24:28 <Justin_o> clown: yes, thanks
2016-10-25T18:24:34 <Justin_o> and short cut keys
2016-10-25T18:25:06 <clown> hmm\xe2\x80\xa6.  what are short cut keys?  Some OSes have "accelerators" vs "mnemonics".
2016-10-25T18:25:20 <Justin_o> clown: i guess i mean the key commands
2016-10-25T18:25:37 <Justin_o> i don\'t know orca\'s key commands but if you had something like ctrl-h for headings
2016-10-25T18:25:38 * michelled joined the channel
2016-10-25T18:25:54 <Justin_o> would that change if you had a language where headings started with a different character
2016-10-25T18:25:54 <clown> The asnwer I got is, "clown: on phone, but it shouldn\'t"
2016-10-25T18:26:00 <clown> *answer
2016-10-25T18:26:00 <Justin_o> haha
2016-10-25T18:26:02 <Justin_o> htanks
2016-10-25T18:26:04 <Justin_o> thanks
2016-10-25T18:26:49 <clown> I guess orca\'s are fixed, but I remember there is UI to allow the user to change the keys to whatever they want.
2016-10-25T18:27:54 <Justin_o> clown: thanks, seems like that\'s what others do as well, from what i can tell
2016-10-25T18:29:34 <clown> Justin_o:  for your reading pleasure:  https://help.gnome.org/users/orca/stable/preferences_key_bindings.html.en

2016-10-25T18:35:08 <Justin_o> :)
2016-10-25T18:35:14 <Kobi> Justin_o, jessm, anyone else that this concerns: We are setting up a new Google Docs for the OER, here\'s the link; https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tArsmkiXi1EJWn8sV7Jw7KE6LxpD9KvAc7PWdWrSJgw/edit?usp=sharing
2016-10-25T18:36:36 <Justin_o> Kobi: thanks. It\'s nice that you\'ve added some colour, just make sure that there are no issues with contrast.
2016-10-25T18:38:06 <Kobi> Justin_o:  no problem,  the first one was kind of impromptu,  and this new one should follow the ADOD guide

2016-10-25T18:52:54 <Kobi> Not a flowchart, a mindmap, sorry
2016-10-25T18:52:57 <gtirloni> Justin_o: had to restart the jenkins agent so it\'d pick the new java that had been installed. the job is running now
2016-10-25T18:56:45 <Justin_o> gtirloni: that\'s great thanks
2016-10-25T18:58:27 <Kobi> is there a community meeting tomorrow afternoon?
2016-10-25T18:58:33 <Justin_o> Kobi: yes, you\'d probably want to describe what it\'s showing, that is to provide a narrative for the information it is conveying.
2016-10-25T18:58:55 <Kobi> Ok, thanks
2016-10-25T18:59:04 <Justin_o> Kobi: yes, there is a community meeting tomorrow, but it is in the morning this week and not the afternoon.
2016-10-25T18:59:45 <Kobi> Justin_o:  OK, thank you
2016-10-25T18:59:49 <Justin_o> gtirloni: it looks like the build isn\'t working still, or is just taking a while to finish
2016-10-25T19:00:22 <gtirloni> Justin_o: last successful build took 22min

2016-10-25T19:59:41 <simonjb> I don\'t have a bluetooth keyboard, but I can try connecting a USB one...
2016-10-25T20:00:11 <Justin_o> simonjb: sure the usb keyboard would also be interesting
2016-10-25T20:00:25 <Justin_o> thanks
2016-10-25T20:01:03 <Justin_o> team0rk
2016-10-25T20:01:06 <Justin_o> oops
2016-10-25T20:01:31 <avtar> uh oh
2016-10-25T20:01:40 <Justin_o> now i have to change my machines wifi password
2016-10-25T20:01:45 <Justin_o> but i guess it\'s safe in the office
2016-10-25T20:05:08 <simonjb> sorry Justin_o I don\'t have the right USB cable -- too many USB connectors
2016-10-25T20:05:27 <simonjb> I have a keyboard with a micro B connector
2016-10-25T20:05:35 <simonjb> but my phone has USB C
2016-10-25T20:05:51 <simonjb> I\'ve got some USB C cables but not USB to micro B
2016-10-25T20:06:36 <simonjb> I\'ve got C <-> A and A <-> micro B, arrgh
2016-10-25T20:08:18 <simonjb> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB#Cables_and_their_connectors lists 10! connectors!
2016-10-25T20:08:28 * clown_mtg has quit
2016-10-25T20:08:52 <simonjb> sorry make that 8
2016-10-25T20:08:55 <simonjb> still
2016-10-25T20:09:01 <simonjb> that\'s a lot
2016-10-25T20:09:07 <Justin_o> i didn\'t realize there were so many variants
2016-10-25T20:09:19 <Justin_o> that is frustrating
2016-10-25T20:09:41 <Justin_o> if you\'re willing to test that next time you\'re in the office, you could probably use one of the bluetooth keyboards we have here
2016-10-25T20:09:56 <Justin_o> it\'s for investigating an issue we have uncovered in PhET
2016-10-25T20:10:06 <Justin_o> and thanks for trying
2016-10-25T20:13:23 <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: infusion 2.0 release testing is good to go, please pick up some tasks from https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yFJotFr4_HJhNK-kwAxjE4gCozJYu48xIIjkA91gloU/edit?usp=sharing
2016-10-25T20:14:36 <simonjb> Justin_o: yes, I can definitely test when I\'m in the office tomorrow -- please remind me if nobody else has been able to test at that point
2016-10-25T20:14:47 <Justin_o> simonjb: thanks for the help
2016-10-25T20:16:15 <simonjb> 21 \'standard\' USB cable combinations
2016-10-25T20:16:29 <Justin_o> for real :(
2016-10-25T20:16:35 <Justin_o> are any of those no longer supported?
2016-10-25T20:17:19 <simonjb> there are 21 marked "Yes" in the wikipedia table

2016-10-25T16:01:27 <cindyli> it\'s ad-hoc at the moment, alanharnum, but we were thinking to use the regular ouch meeting
2016-10-25T16:05:35 <colinclark> you\'re welcome to join

2016-10-25T16:05:51 <colinclark> I believe Monday\'s ouch meeting will, as cindyli says, cover exactly this topic
2016-10-25T16:12:57 <alanharnum> great, thanks
2016-10-25T16:19:39 <cindyli> Justin_o: the UIO pull request has been merged
2016-10-25T16:19:56 <Justin_o> cindyli: that\'s excellent, thanks
2016-10-25T16:20:01 <cindyli> np
2016-10-25T16:21:27 <cindyli> btw, Justin_o, i still keep that JIRA open for adding web driven tests for this issue later on
2016-10-25T16:21:46 <Justin_o> cindyli: i wonder if it would be better to just create a new JIRA for that
2016-10-25T16:22:15 <cindyli> we can do that do, whichever is more proper, Justin_o
2016-10-25T16:22:51 <Justin_o> cindyli: i\'d lean towards a new JIRA as the immediate issue for this is addressed. The web driver work will be a larger undertaking, and not sure when we\'ll start in on it.
2016-10-25T16:23:43 <cindyli> sounds reasonable. i will create a new jira, Justin_o

2016-10-25T16:55:50 <colinclark> Justin_o: how are you feeling about the Infusion 2.0 release now? Are you inching towards code freeze?
2016-10-25T16:56:12 <Justin_o> colinclark: writing up the e-mail for it at this moment
2016-10-25T17:02:02 <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: we\'re moving on to testing for Infusion 2.0. Please pick up tasks from https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yFJotFr4_HJhNK-kwAxjE4gCozJYu48xIIjkA91gloU/edit#heading=h.navy2mougfby
2016-10-25T17:02:31 <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: please also note that during this time, the Infusion Repo is frozen. I\'ll be sending out an e-mail to the fluid-work mailing list with the details shortly.

2016-10-25T17:29:13 <Justin_o> simonjb: thanks for the help, yes the build site should have been updated after the latest merge
2016-10-25T17:29:37 <Justin_o> simonjb: actually... ;( looks like the last build failed
2016-10-25T17:30:59 <Justin_o> gtirloni, avtar: would one of you be able to help me debug why the infusion build failed
2016-10-25T17:31:11 <cindyli> Bosmon: do you have other comments on kasparnet\'s infusion-docs pull request for the model transformation API: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/pull/86
2016-10-25T17:31:15 <avtar> Justin_o: we\'re conducting an interview at the moment
2016-10-25T17:31:24 <Justin_o> gtirloni, avtar: it looks like a java error
2016-10-25T17:31:25 <Justin_o> ;(
2016-10-25T17:34:59 <simonjb> java.io.FileNotFoundException
2016-10-25T17:42:06 <Justin_o> simonjb: thanks, i can\'t actually see what file it\'s trying to access
2016-10-25T17:47:04 <avtar> Justin_o: looks like a file related to timezones
2016-10-25T17:47:07 <avtar> Caused by: java.lang.Error: java.io.FileNotFoundException: /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-1.8.0.102-1.b14.el7_2.x86_64/jre/lib/tzdb.dat (No such file or directory)
2016-10-25T17:47:52 <Justin_o> avtar: is that a bug on the server itself, i\'m not sure how that would come from Infusion
2016-10-25T17:48:57 <avtar> Justin_o: my first guess is that it\'s a server related issue, nothing to do with infusion
