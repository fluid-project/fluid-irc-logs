b'2016-06-22T20:20:24 <alanharnum> reducing the amount of files loaded would involve something like rolling up the file templates for individual panels into a single file, same thing for the message files
2016-06-22T20:22:43 <Justin_o> alanharnum: okay cool thanks...  i started looking at the lazy loading a bit earlier.. which seemed to work although you had to click on the show tab a few times before it would open. The messages were a bit harder because the message loader right now also loads in the strings for the text on the tab

2016-06-22T20:34:37 <cindyli> hi Bosmon, a question about infusion promises. as u know i\'m making lots of requests into pouchdb to do all sorts of things. one problem i\'m dealing with is, before i update a doc. i need to check the user is correct, which is one async request, and, the gpii token is correct, which is another async request
2016-06-22T20:35:06 <cindyli> so, i have a promise chain, one waits on the other to get the response
2016-06-22T20:35:23 <cindyli> i wonder if fluid.promise.fireTransformEvent() is the right solution for this case?
2016-06-22T20:35:32 <cindyli> or fluid.promise.follow()?
2016-06-22T20:36:11 <Bosmon> cindyli - it depends if there is any data dependency
2016-06-22T20:36:28 <cindyli> there is, yes
2016-06-22T20:36:42 <cindyli> i have 2 input arguments: user id and date to update
2016-06-22T20:36:50 <Bosmon> date?
2016-06-22T20:36:55 <cindyli> sorry, data
2016-06-22T20:37:20 <cindyli> the very first request needs data.id as the input
2016-06-22T20:37:39 <cindyli> and the 2nd one requires data.token
2016-06-22T20:37:40 <Bosmon> Ok
2016-06-22T20:37:47 <cindyli> and the 3rd request needs both
2016-06-22T20:37:49 <Bosmon> But it sounds like there is no data dependency *between* the requests
2016-06-22T20:37:56 <Bosmon> In this case fluid.promise.sequence is fine
2016-06-22T20:38:23 <Bosmon> Do any of the requests provide data which is used by the other requests?
2016-06-22T20:38:38 <cindyli> yes, the 2nd one needs the response of the first one
2016-06-22T20:38:49 <Bosmon> I see
2016-06-22T20:38:55 <Bosmon> What is returned in the response of the first one?
2016-06-22T20:39:20 <cindyli> and the 3rd request needs the response of the 2nd one
2016-06-22T20:39:38 <Bosmon> What is in the response of the 2nd one?
2016-06-22T20:40:16 <cindyli> the first one returns an object of the auth decision, the 2nd request needs the "gpiiToken" field of that object
2016-06-22T20:41:25 <cindyli> the 2nd request returns an object of gpii token, the 3rd request needs to compare its "userid" with the input "userId"
2016-06-22T20:41:37 <cindyli> to make sure the auth decision belongs to the right user
2016-06-22T20:41:48 <Bosmon> cindyli - ok, then yes, this is a classic use case for fireTransformEvent
2016-06-22T20:42:12 <Bosmon> You should set up a "pseudoevent" which governs this workflow and set up all the requests as listeners to this event
2016-06-22T20:43:00 <cindyli> ok, Bosmon,
2016-06-22T20:43:31 <Bosmon> Following the same pattern that we do, e.g. in the GPII for the matchmaking process, etc.
2016-06-22T20:43:36 <cindyli> fluid.promise.fireTransformEvent(event, payload[, options]) shows the 2nd argument is "payload". how can i pass 2 arguments then?
2016-06-22T20:43:50 <Bosmon> cindyli - just pack them into a structure
2016-06-22T20:43:51 <cindyli> can i do things like [userId, data]
2016-06-22T20:44:02 <Bosmon> We despise blind arrays :)
2016-06-22T20:44:14 <Bosmon> You can do things like {userId: userId, data: data}
2016-06-22T20:44:15 <cindyli> object
2016-06-22T20:44:24 <cindyli> cool
2016-06-22T20:44:40 <Bosmon> Although if you want information to be common across all listeners, you should instead stick it into "options"
2016-06-22T20:45:04 <Bosmon> Well
2016-06-22T20:45:12 <Bosmon> I guess it might work better if you used the "megapayloadism" pattern
2016-06-22T20:45:22 <cindyli> what\'s that
2016-06-22T20:45:24 <Bosmon> And design each listener to accumulate into the same, common, "megapayload"
2016-06-22T20:45:30 <Bosmon> Well, it is also what we use in the matchmaking flow
2016-06-22T20:45:49 <Bosmon> Each listener accumulates more information at a new path into the same giant payload, and then accumulates it on like a snowball
2016-06-22T20:46:24 <cindyli> Bosmon: i already have the first 2 requests implemented as functions. they take in different arguments
2016-06-22T20:47:00 <Bosmon> cindyli - you can wrap them in megapayloadic wrappers
2016-06-22T20:47:07 <Bosmon> This is all that some future version of the framework will do anyway
2016-06-22T20:47:38 <cindyli> do we have a megapayloadic wrapper example?
2016-06-22T20:48:49 <Bosmon> cindyli - sure, here\'s one: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/src/FlowManagerUtilities.js#L93
2016-06-22T20:48:52 * gtirloni joined the channel
2016-06-22T20:51:48 <cindyli> ah, so Bosmon, if using the structure of {userId: userId, data: data}, i should be able to control the argument like "{arguments}.0.data.id", right?
2016-06-22T20:52:09 <cindyli> this line is using "{arguments}.0" - https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/src/FlowManagerUtilities.js#L208
2016-06-22T20:52:24 <Bosmon> Well, that\'s another possibility, yes
2016-06-22T20:52:46 <Bosmon> But you still have the problem of adapting the return value
2016-06-22T20:52:46 <cindyli> ok, i will give a try. thanks, Bosmon
2016-06-22T20:53:01 <Bosmon> So you will probably need some wrapper anyway, if you don\'t want to disturb your existing functions
2016-06-22T20:53:22 <Bosmon> It depends on what the pattern of data access really is
2016-06-22T20:54:28 <gtirloni> jhernandez_, hey, thanks for testing the 3d accel. i\'m running a bunch of tests here to try and nail down where this issue started happening (which vbox version) with fedora 24 and ubuntu 16.04 (for comparison). i\'ll open a bug against vbox with this information and update those PRs as well
2016-06-22T20:56:10 <cindyli> i think i probably do need wrappers, Bosmon. i wonder where my original object argument will be after receiving the response of a previous request. i will experiment
2016-06-22T20:56:51 <cindyli> i probably need wrappers for the first 2 requests
2016-06-22T20:57:35 * michelled has quit
2016-06-22T20:59:57 <Bosmon> cindyli - this is why we use the "megapayloadism" pattern
2016-06-22T21:00:07 <Bosmon> To make it clear where all the responses to any previous requests can be acquired
2016-06-22T21:00:18 * anvk has quit
2016-06-22T21:00:23 <Bosmon> If we do this enough times, eventually we will make a standard utility for it
2016-06-22T21:00:29 <Bosmon> But so far the matchmaker was the first exercises
2016-06-22T21:00:31 <Bosmon> exercise
2016-06-22T21:01:10 <cindyli> Bosmon: each listener on the chain needs to return a promise, right?
2016-06-22T21:01:52 <cindyli> so to create a wrapper, i need to:
2016-06-22T21:02:05 <cindyli> var promise = request1();
2016-06-22T21:02:38 <cindyli> promise.then(function (response) {wrap the response into another promise})
2016-06-22T21:02:50 <cindyli> return this "another promise"
2016-06-22T21:03:20 <Bosmon> cindyli - yes, broadly like that
2016-06-22T21:03:29 <cindyli> ok. will try
2016-06-22T21:03:52 <cindyli> thanks a lot, Bosmon
2016-06-22T21:04:23 <Bosmon> cindyli - no worries, it is exciting to be dealing with our 2nd instance of this problem :)
2016-06-22T21:04:39 <Bosmon> The "modern framework" will eventually allow you to do this just with expander definitions
2016-06-22T21:04:45 <Bosmon> And the wrapping layer will go away
2016-06-22T21:05:59 <cindyli> cool. good to know
2016-06-22T21:06:33 <cindyli> heading home\xe2\x80\xa6
2016-06-22T21:13:26 <jhernandez_> gtirloni: cool, thanks! are you experiencing the same then? let me know if you want me to try things out
2016-06-22T21:16:56 <gtirloni> jhernandez_, yeah, i have the same issue on a win10 host, with virtualbox 5.0.22... guests fedora24 and ubuntu 16.04. there are some bug reports about 3d accel being broken lately in virtualbox.
2016-06-22T21:17:27 <gtirloni> just confirmed 3d accel is fine with virtualbox 4.3.38 :/ let\'s see if there is an older version of 5.x that works...

2016-06-22T16:36:21 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: Hello.. just looking over the branch you dropped in the channel yesterday.
2016-06-22T16:36:45 <PaliwalSparsh> sure Justin_o
2016-06-22T16:37:24 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: so far one thing I\'ve noticed is for the language buttons, these could actually all be boiled down to a single function that just takes in the language code. https://github.com/PaliwalSparsh/Discovery-Cat/blob/midterm/demo/js/langPref.js#L170-L194
2016-06-22T16:39:50 <PaliwalSparsh> Sure Justin_o will make that change
2016-06-22T16:40:28 * alanharnum has quit
2016-06-22T16:42:09 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: also the create methods are quite long, i think we could probably do some refactoring in there to make them more configurable. I\'m not exactly sure what the best approach for that would be, maybe invokers, but it\'s something you could start thinking about. And maybe a bit later in the project you could try to clean up those sections.

2016-06-22T17:18:39 <clown> jhernandez_:  do you have a few minutes for a hopefully quick question?
2016-06-22T17:18:50 <jhernandez_> clown: sure
2016-06-22T17:19:45 <clown> Is this the correct way to use the DR\'s alwaysInstalled() function in a test spec?  See: https://github.com/klown/universal/blob/a61644e1bdc29af3d775d2ace0cbba28471f66ba/tests/platform/windows/windows-builtIn-testSpec.js#L249
2016-06-22T17:23:08 <jhernandez_> clown: I *think so*
2016-06-22T17:23:15 <clown> :-)
2016-06-22T17:23:36 <jhernandez_> I mean, that looks correct to me
2016-06-22T17:24:36 * clown looks for how it\'s used in the windows solutions registry...
2016-06-22T17:25:42 <clown> Here is how it is declared in the solutions registry:  https://github.com/klown/universal/blob/a61644e1bdc29af3d775d2ace0cbba28471f66ba/testData/solutions/win32.json#L1442
2016-06-22T17:25:55 <clown> there is just a "type".
2016-06-22T17:26:47 <clown> For checking if JAWS is installed, there are a lot more parameters:  https://github.com/klown/universal/blob/a61644e1bdc29af3d775d2ace0cbba28471f66ba/testData/solutions/win32.json#L70
2016-06-22T17:28:30 <clown> And, in that case, the deviceReporters block has something similar in the test spec: https://github.com/klown/universal/blob/a61644e1bdc29af3d775d2ace0cbba28471f66ba/tests/platform/windows/windows-jaws-testSpec.js#L50
2016-06-22T17:28:40 * cindyli has quit
2016-06-22T17:29:23 <clown> maybe the alwaysInstalled case should include a "expectInstalled" property that is always true?  Or is that not needed?

2016-06-22T18:44:53 <jhernandez_> or for things that we can\'t determine whether they\'re installed or not

2016-06-22T20:14:05 <Justin_o> alanharnum: wanted to check in with you about the UIO optimizations strategies that were discussed. So you\'re almost done with the native sliders.. what else was looked at.. i might have some time to work on it, here and there
2016-06-22T20:14:50 <alanharnum> Justin_o: lazy loading and reducing the amount of files loaded were the big ones
2016-06-22T20:15:08 <alanharnum> i don\'t believe there were others
2016-06-22T20:16:34 <Justin_o> alanharnum: thanks, anything in particular about those
2016-06-22T20:16:43 <Justin_o> e.g. strategies that were discussed
2016-06-22T20:18:38 <alanharnum> Justin_o: the lazy loading was basically to delay loading of the various resource files until a user intent to interact with them (via "show display preferences") occured
2016-06-22T20:19:32 <Bosmon> Hi there cindyli
2016-06-22T20:19:35 <alanharnum> I looked at that one a little and found it required a lot of sequencing changes, given the number of components involved
2016-06-22T20:20:06 <Bosmon> Would you be able to take a quick look at my update of your docs pull?
