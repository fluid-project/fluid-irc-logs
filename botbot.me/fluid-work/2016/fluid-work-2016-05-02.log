2016-05-02T16:09:22 <dins> according to docs, thats what I found
2016-05-02T16:09:29 * alanharnum has quit
2016-05-02T16:10:12 <dins> so, there I had to mention the repeating selector like repeatingSelectors: ["key"]
2016-05-02T16:10:30 <dins> and some more things
2016-05-02T16:11:06 <dins> am I correct here
2016-05-02T16:12:19 <dins> http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/RendererComponents.html
2016-05-02T16:12:32 <dins> these are what I was going through
2016-05-02T16:13:42 <Bosmon> dins - I don\'t recommend using the renderer, especially for such a case
2016-05-02T16:13:59 <Bosmon> I am speaking as the author of it here, so my opinion carries some weight :)
2016-05-02T16:14:05 <Bosmon> We have been meaning to rewrite it for many years
2016-05-02T16:14:16 <colinclark> dins: Bosmon is pretty awesome for questions, for this reason :)
2016-05-02T16:14:20 <Bosmon> I suggest that instead you use a more straightforward pattern, of the kind you can find here in the Uploader\'s code
2016-05-02T16:14:35 <dins> Bosmon, thanks Bosmon
2016-05-02T16:14:46 <dins> on time I asked this questions here

2016-05-02T16:15:25 <dins> I was like off today because of that
2016-05-02T16:15:49 <Bosmon> Here is an Infusion component which is simply a "viewComponent" rather than a "rendererComponent"
2016-05-02T16:16:22 <Bosmon> And it uses standard jQuery primitives to render new markup, whilst participating in all the standard Infusion patterns - for example, the use of a DOM binder, storing the markup template in configurable options, etc.
2016-05-02T16:16:39 <Bosmon> This work of colinclark\'s remains our "best practice" in this area
2016-05-02T16:17:01 <dins> Thanks looot
2016-05-02T16:17:06 <Bosmon> I hope after a major rewrite of the framework this year to be able to rewrite the renderer next year
2016-05-02T16:17:11 <dins> I;l have and see
2016-05-02T16:17:19 <Bosmon> But for the time being it is only recommended for quite simple cases
2016-05-02T16:18:11 <Bosmon> You could also feel free to use a standard markup templating solution such as handlebars - one member who is usually here, "the-t-in-rtf" has built some Infusion ecosystem on top of this
2016-05-02T16:18:45 <Bosmon> As long as you participate in the standard Infusion viewComponent and modelComponent infrastructure properly, anything else you do is good
2016-05-02T16:19:16 <dins> hmmm

2016-05-02T16:20:16 <Bosmon> As you can see further down on this page, RendererComponent has an annotation reading "the use of the current renderer and component hierarchy is not recommended."
2016-05-02T16:21:43 <dins> ah

2016-05-02T17:33:05 <cindyli> jhung, Bosmon, the live doc site has been re-deployed with the latest master branch. the problem i had earlier was resulted from the renaming of docpad.js to docpad-config.js
2016-05-02T17:33:37 <Bosmon> cindyli - yes
2016-05-02T17:33:39 <cindyli> will do some research on why and how to use a renamed config file
2016-05-02T17:33:46 <Bosmon> But the -c option is meant to compensate for this
2016-05-02T17:33:57 <Bosmon> cindyli - I explain the renaming at the head of the docpad-config.js file
2016-05-02T17:34:05 <Bosmon> It is necessary to allow the use of npm scripts on Windows
2016-05-02T17:34:06 <cindyli> might be a docpad bug
2016-05-02T17:34:57 <cindyli> Bosmon: it seems working fine with local deployment but not the live site run
2016-05-02T17:36:09 <Bosmon> cindyli - perhaps a bug in the gh-pages plugin
2016-05-02T17:36:28 <Bosmon> cindyli - was the only workaround you found to rename the docpad-config.js file back again?
2016-05-02T17:36:38 <cindyli> so far, yes, Bosmon
2016-05-02T17:36:39 * the-t-in-rtf joined the channel
2016-05-02T17:36:45 <Bosmon> unfortunate
2016-05-02T17:37:01 <Bosmon> I spent more than an hour last night trying to make this work : P
2016-05-02T17:37:27 <cindyli> oh ah
2016-05-02T17:37:49 <Bosmon> I can never remember the blasted docpad command line options
2016-05-02T17:38:00 <Bosmon> And tired of constantly reading the README to find them again
2016-05-02T17:38:09 <cindyli> me same
2016-05-02T17:38:29 <cindyli> much more convenient to have the simplified command version
2016-05-02T17:38:41 <Bosmon> There\'s an annoying bug on windows that the "docpad.js" file becomes interpreted as executable when running "docpad"
2016-05-02T17:39:08 <Bosmon> So I got assistance on the pull request that I reference in my comment at the head of the file
2016-05-02T17:39:15 <Bosmon> They made this suggestion for the "-c" option
2016-05-02T17:39:22 <cindyli> i see

2016-05-02T17:41:56 <cindyli> Bosmon: i\'m going to file a jira for it and do some search to find out if there\'s a way that "-c" option and gh-pages update can live together
2016-05-02T17:42:24 <Bosmon> cindyli - thanks

2016-05-02T18:01:05 <jhung> cindyli: what you can do for now is add a new script to package.json: generate": "docpad generate -c docpad-config.js --env static". Then you would have to manually copy over contents of ./out/ to the gh-pages branch and push it.
2016-05-02T18:02:56 <cindyli> jhung: do you mean this - https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/blob/master/package.json#L9
2016-05-02T18:03:24 <cindyli> why does it need a manual copy of ./out/ to the gh-pages branch?
2016-05-02T18:03:49 <jhung> cindyli: the issue is with the deploy-ghpages plugin correct?
2016-05-02T18:04:15 <jhung> so we\'d just have to manually do what the plugin does for us automatically.
2016-05-02T18:04:18 <cindyli> i see ur point, instead of directly deploy to ghpages, use a local generation + manual copy, jhung
2016-05-02T18:04:28 <jhung> exactly cindyli.
2016-05-02T18:04:41 <cindyli> that\'s a work around. yes, good to know
2016-05-02T18:07:49 <jhung> cindyli: I have another fix which is a bit better.
2016-05-02T18:09:16 <jhung> The default name for the docpad configuration file is docpad.js. So if you rename the docpad-config.js file to docpad.js, and remove the -c option from lines 8 and 9 in package.json - it should work fine with the gh-pages plugin.
2016-05-02T18:09:16 <cindyli> jhung: what\'s that
2016-05-02T18:10:46 <cindyli> jhung: that\'s what i did to deploy the live site just now. however, Bosmon has an issue with the windows platform that docpad.js becomes an executable when running docpad command. see his earlier reply above
2016-05-02T18:11:12 <cindyli> https://github.com/docpad/docpad/issues/561
2016-05-02T18:11:16 <jhung> ah I missed that cindyli.
2016-05-02T18:14:10 <jhung> cindyli: ah I see. What a pain. Perhaps using powershell or another shell in Windows would be an acceptable solution as it wouldn\'t break the deploy process? Thoughts Bosmon?
2016-05-02T18:38:51 <Bosmon> jhung - it\'s not really reasonable to require the user to use a special shell to make the standard scripts work
2016-05-02T18:39:02 <Bosmon> I think the generate + copy route seems more viable
2016-05-02T18:39:04 * lliskovoi has quit
2016-05-02T18:39:15 <Bosmon> We can just add a further script which executes the copy manually

2016-05-02T18:59:24 <cindyli> Bosmon, jhung, i don\'t find a way of using one single command to run "docpad deploy-ghpages" with "-c". seems not many ppl using "-c". the JIRA created for this issue - https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5896
2016-05-02T18:59:41 <cindyli> looking into "add a further script which executes the copy manually"
2016-05-02T19:00:14 <cindyli> hopefully by altering the package.json to run multiple commands within one node command

2016-05-02T15:08:47 <cindyli1> Bosmon, jhung, the steps i did for the live site deployment: 1. cloned the https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs into a separate directory so that the deployment used the "origin" repo, 2. run the deploy command

2016-05-02T15:28:15 <dins> Hi michelledl, simonjb, ..... currently I\'m working on my project when ever I have a time, Also I have been working on a bug fix which I had started those days.............. Apart from that I\'m still going through infusion documentations since I\',m still new to this framework
2016-05-02T15:28:56 <dins> Could please tell me if there is anything else I should be working on these days
2016-05-02T15:30:36 <dins> cindyli, I updated the pull request.......... Could you please look in if u are not busy
2016-05-02T15:31:04 <cindyli> sure, dins, i will have a look
2016-05-02T15:31:58 <dins> thanks cindyli

2016-05-02T15:48:40 <cindyli> that\'s great, thanks, jhung
2016-05-02T15:51:28 * danayo has quit
2016-05-02T15:53:48 <jhung> ok cindyli. I\'m still looking into a viable solution, but at least I can tell you what the issue is. If you change the extension of the file in the ./src/documents/ directory from *.md to *.html.md, the docpad generate \xe2\x80\x94env static process should complete without error.
2016-05-02T15:54:16 <jhung> cindyli: the order of extensions tells docpad which order to apply renderers to the content.
2016-05-02T15:54:52 <jhung> cindyli: the lack of .html is causing the problem. But not sure why it fails in docpad generate but not docpad run.
2016-05-02T15:55:25 <michelled1> dins: you were mentioned that you were starting to look at a piano controller
2016-05-02T15:55:37 <michelled1> I bet colinclark would be interested in that
2016-05-02T15:55:37 <dins> yes
2016-05-02T15:55:50 <dins> I started
2016-05-02T15:55:50 <colinclark> yes, very much so
2016-05-02T15:55:53 <michelled1> do you have ideas of the design and behaviour?
2016-05-02T15:56:09 <colinclark> I recently tried to rescusitate the old "automagic music maker" piano
2016-05-02T15:56:16 <colinclark> but found it was too poorly factored in its current state
2016-05-02T15:56:24 <colinclark> and so I used "Qwerty Hancock" instead
2016-05-02T15:56:34 <jhung> renaming all the files isn\'t a great solution though cindyli. I hope there\'s a better solution like adding something to the docpad-config.js file.
2016-05-02T15:56:40 <colinclark> which was just flat-out awful in some key ways, dins
2016-05-02T15:56:50 <colinclark> It was all absolute pixel-based
2016-05-02T15:57:19 <dins> wait I\'l check
2016-05-02T15:57:28 <colinclark> and it didn\'t even include class names on the elements it created
2016-05-02T15:57:36 <colinclark> which made it really hard to style
2016-05-02T15:57:56 <colinclark> so I\'ll be super excited to see what you come up with, dins
2016-05-02T15:57:59 * alanharnum joined the channel
2016-05-02T15:58:35 <dins> colinclark, I just came up with the  UI design
2016-05-02T15:58:39 <colinclark> cool
2016-05-02T15:58:44 <dins> it looks so better
2016-05-02T15:58:54 <dins> I can share that with u
2016-05-02T15:59:32 <colinclark> i\'d love to see it
2016-05-02T15:59:58 <cindyli> great finding, jhung. let me know if anything i can help to look up
2016-05-02T16:00:57 <dins> https://github.com/Dinuka2013513/music-ctrls/tree/piano-ctrl
2016-05-02T16:01:00 <jhung> cindyli: if you\'re pressed for time and would like ti deployed ASAP, then you might want to just temporarily rename the files and deploy.
2016-05-02T16:01:06 <dins> it\'s in this branch
2016-05-02T16:01:27 * Bosmon7 has quit
2016-05-02T16:02:04 <dins> U have to build it and browse.............
2016-05-02T16:02:22 <dins> or u can just browse this file https://github.com/Dinuka2013513/music-ctrls/blob/piano-ctrl/src/templates/piano.html
2016-05-02T16:02:29 <dins> that would be easier
2016-05-02T16:02:48 <dins> It\'s still in the initial level
2016-05-02T16:04:00 <colinclark> cool
2016-05-02T16:04:16 <colinclark> it looks like it will be great! :)
2016-05-02T16:04:27 <cindyli> jhung: i think we have some time to find a proper solution. a question with renaming files is that the files only need to be renamed locally without needing to be pushed up, is that correct?
2016-05-02T16:04:37 <dins> let me know your thoughts
2016-05-02T16:04:38 * PaliwalSparsh1 joined the channel
2016-05-02T16:04:53 <jhung> cindyli: that\'s correct. You don\'t have to commit the rename.
2016-05-02T16:05:53 <dins> I\'m still new to infusion, so, still I\'m going through examples to get the knowledge
2016-05-02T16:06:17 <cindyli> that\'s nice. if it takes too long to find a proper solution, i can deploy the doc site by renaming files locally and file another jira for this issue, jhung
2016-05-02T16:06:41 <cindyli> jhung: did this happen before with deploying the live site?
2016-05-02T16:07:05 <colinclark> dins: That makes sense. Don\'t hesitate to ask michelled1 or simonjb or anyone here if you have infusion questions
2016-05-02T16:07:19 <jhung> cindyli: it\'s been a while since I\'ve looked at the infusion docs, but I don\'t recall there ever being an issue.
2016-05-02T16:07:25 <colinclark> there\'s a bit of a learning curve, but it\'s pretty awesome once you know its basic idioms, dins
2016-05-02T16:07:39 <dins> sure....
2016-05-02T16:08:15 * PaliwalSparsh has quit
2016-05-02T16:09:02 <dins> I have a small question...... in order to bind a list of dynamic components to div what I should use is, fluid.rendererComponent
