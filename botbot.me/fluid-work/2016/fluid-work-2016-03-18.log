b"2016-03-18T20:36:44 <katyvincent> I mean Flow manager, not flower manger
2016-03-18T20:38:12 <katyvincent> Or some wiki page where it shows the possible configuration of the different gpii components. Which ones can be local and which ones can be in the cloud. Which one must be in the cloud.

2016-03-18T20:48:07 <colinclark> that would be awesome
2016-03-18T20:48:28 <colinclark> katyvincent: Would you like to work with Javi next week on making a table and diagram like that?

2016-03-18T20:49:36 <Bosmon7> colinclark, katyvincent - we are also sitting down right now with cindyli, simonjb and michelled1 working on an updated set of diagrams showing possibly deployment structures
2016-03-18T20:49:41 <colinclark> oh awesome
2016-03-18T20:49:44 <colinclark> that's fantastic!

b'2016-03-18T18:27:02 <colinclark> Welcome, Adewale_GPII!
2016-03-18T18:27:03 <gabrielmancini> yes
2016-03-18T18:27:05 <gabrielmancini> :-D
2016-03-18T18:27:06 <Adewale_GPII> hey guys
2016-03-18T18:27:19 <gloob> format is not defintive, there\'s some concerns about how accessible is google forms
2016-03-18T18:27:23 <gloob> Adewale_GPII: o/
2016-03-18T18:27:30 <colinclark> gloob: Yes, I think there are accessibility concerns
2016-03-18T18:27:30 * Adewale_GPII has quit
2016-03-18T18:27:32 <gloob> colinclark: yes, that is good
2016-03-18T18:28:03 <gloob> colinclark: I will add that section about how assistance is managed
2016-03-18T18:28:08 <colinclark> gloob: Do you want to know anything about usage? Such as how frequently users employ the assistive technologies at the AJCs?
2016-03-18T18:28:13 <colinclark> I\'m just thinking of random things
2016-03-18T18:28:17 <gloob> yes we want

2016-03-18T18:29:06 <colinclark> Anything about the computers in general?
2016-03-18T18:29:17 <colinclark> Such as "are visitors allowed to install their own programs on your computers?"
2016-03-18T18:29:30 <gloob> maybe we also want to know how the software is deployed and if there\'s some custom policies (proxies? users privileges? etc...)
2016-03-18T18:29:31 * wale joined the channel
2016-03-18T18:29:33 <wale> back
2016-03-18T18:29:35 <colinclark> yes, exactly
2016-03-18T18:30:00 <gloob> we have a full section about hw and sw inventory
2016-03-18T18:30:09 <colinclark> gloob: One of the things I\'m particularly keen to learn is the extent to which IT at the job centres is managed
2016-03-18T18:30:12 <colinclark> vs. ad-hoc
2016-03-18T18:30:20 <wale> adewale = wale
2016-03-18T18:30:36 <colinclark> wale: Welcome back!
2016-03-18T18:30:48 <colinclark> I like your much more casual nick
2016-03-18T18:30:56 <gloob> colinclark: we have another survey
2016-03-18T18:31:02 <gloob> let me find it
2016-03-18T18:31:04 <colinclark> I need to get a cool nickname like "gloob"
2016-03-18T18:31:06 <wale> hey .. trying to shed to suit
2016-03-18T18:31:10 <colinclark> hahaha
2016-03-18T18:31:13 <wale> still
2016-03-18T18:31:16 <gloob> that\'s more about that topic
2016-03-18T18:31:24 <colinclark> gloob: Ok, good to know
2016-03-18T18:31:43 <gloob> https://docs.google.com/a/litio.org/forms/d/10md14YTSSyJdtHvqWsZLMN6r36FhYfFbzvnI2UAawEM/viewform
2016-03-18T18:31:44 <gloob> that one
2016-03-18T18:31:49 <gloob> both will be merged
2016-03-18T18:32:15 <colinclark> wale: Best tip I can think of for IRC (it\'s not nearly as nice to use as Slack, but it\'s accessible for people with disabilities) is to always ping people with their nickname if you want to ask a specific question. Most IRC clients are configured to send a notification or sound or bounce when you write the person\'s name.
2016-03-18T18:32:59 <colinclark> gloob: This survey is exactly what I was thinking of!
2016-03-18T18:33:01 <colinclark> Ace!
2016-03-18T18:33:29 <gloob> so, more
2016-03-18T18:33:30 <gloob> MORE
2016-03-18T18:33:40 <gloob> about hw/sw?
2016-03-18T18:33:46 <gloob> what\'s missing
2016-03-18T18:34:10 <wale> got it .. noticed my username\'s in red when you made the reference to me
2016-03-18T18:34:19 <wale> *your username
2016-03-18T18:35:13 <gloob> wale: using another desktop client instead of the web you\'ll receive notification through the notification system of your OS
2016-03-18T18:35:46 <colinclark> gloob: I guess there\'s the question of hardware performance and network connectivity
2016-03-18T18:35:47 <wale> ahh
2016-03-18T18:35:48 <wale> ok
2016-03-18T18:35:52 <colinclark> should we end up installing AT dynamically
2016-03-18T18:35:53 <gloob> BTW after using irssi for years I moved to a bouncer-less usage with LimeChat in OSX, it\'s ace LimeChat
2016-03-18T18:36:06 <gloob> colinclark: that\'s good, network topology details
2016-03-18T18:36:21 <colinclark> I still use Colloquy; not great, but it works. I also use irccloud, which is nice because it\'s just a web app
2016-03-18T18:36:38 <gloob> colloquy for me is overbloated
2016-03-18T18:36:46 <gloob> Limechat maintain the console look and feel
2016-03-18T18:36:59 <gloob> colinclark: yes, we should end installing something AT LEAST
2016-03-18T18:37:14 <gloob> anyhow, in the AJCs we will install the serverbox
2016-03-18T18:37:19 <colinclark> right
2016-03-18T18:37:20 <gloob> or, how it\'s the official name
2016-03-18T18:37:33 <gloob> LocalBox
2016-03-18T18:37:35 <gloob> LOCAL
2016-03-18T18:37:36 <gloob> BOX
2016-03-18T18:37:44 <gloob> your final LOCAL solution :-D
2016-03-18T18:38:22 <gloob> okok, network topology, what else
2016-03-18T18:38:25 <gloob> c\'mon guys
2016-03-18T18:38:39 <colinclark> I think that\'s all I\'ve got for you, gloob
2016-03-18T18:39:17 <gloob> colinclark: thank you very much
2016-03-18T18:39:25 <colinclark> any time!

2016-03-18T19:34:58 <gloob> https://issues.gpii.net
2016-03-18T19:35:19 <gloob> You can sign up by yourself in Jira
2016-03-18T19:35:34 <gloob> some tasks would be modelled there, I guess
2016-03-18T19:37:18 <gabrielmancini> guys i was investigate the universal repository code, and i was wondering why you guys not create the modules as a npm module like plugins
2016-03-18T19:37:31 <wale> yes I am
2016-03-18T19:37:41 <wale> I logged into Jira before
2016-03-18T19:38:02 <amatas> Hi gloob, wale, gabrielmancini , the accounts are already created, you should receive an email with a temporal password.
2016-03-18T19:38:15 <gabrielmancini> let me see
2016-03-18T19:38:18 <wale> thanks amatas

2016-03-18T19:55:37 <katyvincent> Hi. This URL. http://www.cloud4all.info/architecture/components/    shows which component can be local or in a cloud.  We didn\'t see this in the gpii wiki. And we were wondering how accurate this is.

2016-03-18T20:19:39 <michelled1> hi katyvincent, newer versions of these diagrams were recently made
2016-03-18T20:19:59 <michelled1> I think they were probably shared with you already?
2016-03-18T20:20:18 <michelled1> colinclark: was javi\'s new archi diagram shared at one of the meetings?
2016-03-18T20:20:32 * gabrielmancini joined the channel
2016-03-18T20:20:38 * Yan_Hu has quit
2016-03-18T20:21:07 <colinclark> yup, they were
2016-03-18T20:22:07 <colinclark> katyvincent: I would recommend not using any resources from the Cloud4All website
2016-03-18T20:22:34 <colinclark> If it\'s not in the GPII wiki, it\'s probably out of date or more focused on our research efforts rather than the production-oriented system
2016-03-18T20:22:53 <colinclark> Javi\'s latest diagrams were indeed shared by the Sandra with the IBM team; do you have a link to them?
2016-03-18T20:25:37 * alanharnum has quit
2016-03-18T20:26:06 <katyvincent> Yes.  We have those diagram. This document was particular interesting because it showed which component can be in a local and which one can be in a cloud.  Is that anywhere in the gpii wiki?
2016-03-18T20:26:15 * cindyli1 has quit
2016-03-18T20:27:20 <michelled1> katyvincent: I think the main new diagram does show this
2016-03-18T20:27:25 * cindyli joined the channel
2016-03-18T20:28:18 <katyvincent> perhaps. I\'m thinking of a different diagram.  There were many shown to me.  Do you have a link to that diagram.  Is it in the wiki?
2016-03-18T20:29:23 <michelled1> that\'s a good question katyvincent. kasparnet, colinclark, do you know if the new diagrams are on the wiki yet?
2016-03-18T20:30:33 <colinclark> Much to my chagrin, I don\'t think they are yet
2016-03-18T20:30:42 <colinclark> Once Javi is back from his vacation next week, I\'m sure he\'ll put them in
2016-03-18T20:31:20 <colinclark> katyvincent: I\'m a bit confused about your comment, since the first diagram on this page doesn\'t illustrate the difference between cloud and local components
2016-03-18T20:31:28 <colinclark> I guess you must mean the second diagram on that page?
2016-03-18T20:32:36 <colinclark> If so, that diagram is reasonably up to date, though there are things on it that are no longer relevant to the GPII--some of the research components such as the Rule-Based and Statistical Matchmakers and the Context-Aware server
2016-03-18T20:32:47 <colinclark> but I believe Javi was planning to make an updated version of this diagram if he hasn\'t already
2016-03-18T20:33:40 * kasparnet has quit
2016-03-18T20:35:50 * kasparnet joined the channel
2016-03-18T20:36:23 <katyvincent> There is table that has a column "Default Location".   For example, it shows that the component Flower Manger and Context Evaluator can be local and Cloud.   While the Authoroization Server must be in the cloud.   So we were looking for that same info in the gpii wiki page.

2016-03-18T10:32:35 <amatas> I tested it yesterday, and seems to work fine.
2016-03-18T10:33:07 <amatas> the node service gave me some issues in the integration with mediawiki
2016-03-18T10:33:29 <gloob> could it be tested?
2016-03-18T10:33:29 <amatas> I\'m building the containers to deploy them in the production servers

2016-03-18T18:23:18 <gloob> and whoever is listening, could you check that survey?
2016-03-18T18:23:51 <colinclark> gloob: I\'m looking at it. Do you need me to fill it out?
2016-03-18T18:24:09 <gloob> we are building a survey for AJCs and any other question that you think is interesting, please tell me
2016-03-18T18:24:29 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2016-03-18T18:24:32 <gloob> colinclark: just review it and think what is missing or interesting to know from the gpii/fluid/apcp perspective
2016-03-18T18:24:57 <colinclark> gloob: I\'d make the "other" box in the Software Programs question a multi-line input so that they can list many things
2016-03-18T18:25:27 <colinclark> Perhaps add speakers to the list of Assistive Devices
2016-03-18T18:25:41 <colinclark> Is there any need to capture the type of assistance or technical support available for these tools?
2016-03-18T18:26:01 <colinclark> Do you want to know, for example, if someone is available on site to help someone with an AT?
2016-03-18T18:26:29 <colinclark> Or do you want to know anything about who installs them or how they\'re managed (e.g. by an IT person, by an outsourced IT contractor, not at all)?
2016-03-18T18:26:41 * Adewale_GPII joined the channel
2016-03-18T18:26:49 <colinclark> Do you want to know anything about how often they update these programs?
