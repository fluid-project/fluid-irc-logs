2016-09-27T20:55:56 <cindyli> ok. i will wait. shows 10 mins
2016-09-27T20:56:06 <gtirloni> it should default to node 4 (lts).. node 6 is \'current\'.. but i see you\'re not setting which nodejs branch should be used (which is fine, it should be the lts one then)

2016-09-27T20:57:33 <gtirloni> i wonder if you have an old box or something.. since it\'s downloading it now
2016-09-27T21:00:45 <Justin_o> Bosmon: hello.. michelled and I are looking over the open pull requests...

2016-09-27T21:02:19 <Justin_o> Bosmon: are there any pull requests assigned to you for reviewing that you\'d like us to reassign. There seems to be a lot on your plate.
2016-09-27T21:03:31 <Bosmon> Hi - I\'m not even sure which ones are assigned to me :)
2016-09-27T21:03:42 <Bosmon> There\'s no particular UI for it on the pull
2016-09-27T21:03:52 <Bosmon> And there are so many assigned to me globally that I stopped looking long ago
2016-09-27T21:03:57 <Justin_o> Bosmon: :(
2016-09-27T21:04:50 <Justin_o> Bosmon: if you look at the e-mail update i sent yesterday... basically it\'s all the PRs except the two that you filed.
2016-09-27T21:05:05 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i can see if i can filter then in GitHub and send you a link
2016-09-27T21:06:40 <Bosmon> I hate the new Github review UI
2016-09-27T21:06:48 <Bosmon> It no longer has the "commented on an outdated diff" pulldown
2016-09-27T21:08:47 <cindyli> gtirloni: no, it\'s not the first time i run \'vagrant up\' with the \'examples/production-components-vm\' dir
2016-09-27T21:08:52 <michelled> Bosmon, are you reviewing the jquery upgrade?
2016-09-27T21:09:02 <cindyli> but it\'s the first time i run it in the universal root dir
2016-09-27T21:09:19 <avtar> cindyli: sorry, i have too many windows open
2016-09-27T21:09:43 <gtirloni> cindyli: makes sense!
2016-09-27T21:09:47 <avtar> that directory should use the centos vm so ~2 gigs is not the correct size
2016-09-27T21:09:47 <avtar> basically what gtirloni said
2016-09-27T21:10:59 <cindyli> umm.. cannot download the vm: An error occurred while downloading the remote file.
2016-09-27T21:11:04 <cindyli> Recv failure: Operation timed out
2016-09-27T21:11:07 <gtirloni> but in any case, CI failed while trying to `vagrant up` the universal so cindyli is right.. it should be fedora then
2016-09-27T21:11:21 <cindyli> i will try tomorrow in the office
2016-09-27T21:11:31 <gtirloni> let me fire up vagrant on universal\'s root using your branch cindy
2016-09-27T21:11:37 <gtirloni> ok
2016-09-27T21:15:41 <cindyli> gtirloni: can you also have a look on node and npm versions used by the vm. i think "npm install" should work fine with both old and new versions. but, it will cause failure on running universal web tests, \'cuz npm v2 and v3 produce different node_modules/ structures, and some our tests include .js files from node_modules/ that has npm v2 structure
2016-09-27T21:17:44 <gtirloni> cindyli: the provisioning/vars.yml file that was used when the CI ran `vagrant up` has "nodejs_branch: current" in it... but I\'m not sure which commit/branch that came from
2016-09-27T21:18:47 * michelled has quit
2016-09-27T21:19:18 <gtirloni> cindyli: which PR was that coming from?
2016-09-27T21:19:51 <Justin_o> gtirloni: when you have a second could you help me with some updates to the committers list?
2016-09-27T21:19:54 <avtar> gtirloni: https://github.com/GPII/universal/commit/be9dce824ad6cb027e10f4eb9d57e52f6b4847d7
2016-09-27T21:20:04 <gtirloni> cindyli: in your repo, revision 94e6857be752cefd72dcc4c5dc088cb9ce1e720c
2016-09-27T21:20:20 <cindyli> gtirloni: is it from this - https://github.com/GPII/universal/commit/6495c46c3d3c800caffaea2424ee9abfdc4bcad1
2016-09-27T21:21:21 <gtirloni> ok, i think that explains it then. but i wonder why your branch GPII-1821 doesn\'t have that.. I\'m afraid by git-fu is not enough to investigate this
2016-09-27T21:22:02 <cindyli> gtirloni: my GPII-1821 is a sub-division of GPII-1274. I merged master into 1274 after merging in 1821
2016-09-27T21:22:44 <cindyli> gtirloni: probably should bring this up in tomorrow\'s arch meeting

2016-09-27T21:52:56 <Bosmon> Justin_o - no problem, thanks for the great pulls
2016-09-27T21:53:25 <Bosmon> Yes, FLUID-5949 should certainly go in, it\'s straightforward enough and important for a lot of our projects
2016-09-27T21:53:27 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks :)
2016-09-27T21:53:49 <Bosmon> FLUID-5903 still needs a little work
2016-09-27T21:54:15 <Justin_o> Bosmon: ah, i see that in the title now
2016-09-27T21:54:16 <Justin_o> thanks
2016-09-27T21:55:08 <Justin_o> Bosmon: also, if you need a break from coding and other things, if you could recommend an electric tea kettle for our office... ours stopped working, and I\'m not sure what would make for a good replacement.
2016-09-27T21:55:17 <Bosmon> Oh yes
2016-09-27T21:55:25 <Bosmon> Well, you remember my doomed attempts with the previous one
2016-09-27T21:55:44 <Justin_o> as long as it works with our electrical system :)
2016-09-27T21:55:48 <Justin_o> Bosmon: ^
2016-09-27T21:56:10 <Bosmon> It\'s hard to recommend a great kettle in a nation where outlet power is limited to 1440W : P
2016-09-27T21:57:04 <Bosmon> "Some people are tempted to swap out a breaker with a larger one to keep it from tripping.  Don\'t.  Your home\'s wiring almost certainly isn\'t thick enough to handle a higher load. If you put more current through the wiring than it\'s capable of handling, it can heat up and burn your house down."
2016-09-27T21:58:36 <Justin_o> lol
2016-09-27T21:58:54 <Justin_o> we already blue the circuits with an old kettle once, i don\'t think they\'d like it if we burnt the place down :)

2016-09-27T18:13:45 * bens_ has quit
2016-09-27T18:20:02 <jhung> simonjb: I\'m fine either way. We can start here and we can summarize to list if needed.
2016-09-27T18:22:35 <simonjb> am I right in thinking that you are promising to write a parser that splits the content at a token and then uses custom HTML templates for printing?
2016-09-27T18:22:49 * kasparne_ has quit
2016-09-27T18:23:49 <simonjb> and then we would print from a web browser with a print stylesheet?

2016-09-27T18:28:07 * alanharnum has quit
2016-09-27T18:28:10 <jhung> simonjb: yes. I\'m proposing the use of a parser to split pages at a token. The output doesn\'t necessarily have to be an HTML template + css, but it may be the easiest choice.
2016-09-27T18:28:57 <jhung> alternatively we could look into output to EPUB or PDF.
2016-09-27T18:30:19 <simonjb> cool
2016-09-27T18:30:55 * bens_ joined the channel
2016-09-27T18:31:12 <simonjb> jhung: I\'m wondering if (and it\'s a big "if" because I don\'t know) we might be able to do everything in browser using CSS
2016-09-27T18:31:20 <simonjb> without having to write the parser
2016-09-27T18:31:46 <simonjb> using <div>s for front and back
2016-09-27T18:33:33 <jhung> simonjb: I looked into this. The issue is that print HTML + CSS the source content order needs to be correct.
2016-09-27T18:34:07 <simonjb> jhung: we can\'t use absolute positioning to change the pyhsical print order?
2016-09-27T18:34:18 <Justin_o> simonjb, jhung: I haven\'t had a chance to read through the whole wiki page yet, so i might be speaking early, sorry. Anyways, what I think will be difficult will be taking the bottom of one page, and making it the right hand side of another when printing...
2016-09-27T18:34:21 <jhung> The reverse side is the tricky part because the page order gets reversed.

2016-09-27T18:38:27 * bens_ has quit
2016-09-27T18:39:31 <simonjb> jhung: say using nth-of-type plus absolute positioning on the page? https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/:nth-of-type
2016-09-27T18:39:33 <simonjb> of course, I\'ve never tried this :) just thinking it might be possible
2016-09-27T18:40:19 <simonjb> or floats rather than absolute positioning
2016-09-27T18:40:38 <simonjb> if it\'s even float left, if odd float right
2016-09-27T18:40:49 <simonjb> something like that
2016-09-27T18:41:17 <Justin_o> simonjb: i think the content are on different pages though
2016-09-27T18:41:44 <simonjb> ah, different web pages
2016-09-27T18:41:51 <Justin_o> simonjb: looking at the diagrams anyways, it looks like page 1 and 2 are split in half and then mixed together to do the duplexing
2016-09-27T18:42:11 <Justin_o> simonjb: yes.. i believe so, jhung could you confirm that
2016-09-27T18:43:25 <jhung> simonjb: yes. The content are on 2 different pages.
2016-09-27T18:43:51 <simonjb> but we would want them all on one web page so we could print all at once?
2016-09-27T18:44:06 <simonjb> is that right?
2016-09-27T18:44:08 <jhung> I did try the Nth-of-type approach before. It works, but only if we\'re dealing with printing a single page.
2016-09-27T18:44:49 <jhung> simonjb: yes. that\'s the problem I\'m looking to address - hence the parser and template idea. There may be a better approach?
2016-09-27T18:44:55 <Justin_o> jhung: is it possible to get the printer to handle that at all?
2016-09-27T18:45:35 <Justin_o> jhung: cause it sort of seems like to some degree we\'re trying to manage a printer specific implementation
2016-09-27T18:45:49 <jhung> Justin_o: not really. Printers just assume you\'re printing serially.
2016-09-27T18:46:13 <Justin_o> jhung: they don\'t have features to economize
2016-09-27T18:46:21 <simonjb> at the moment we don\'t have any "all-in-one" page version?
2016-09-27T18:46:23 <Justin_o> although i guess it\'s just put front and back on the same side then
2016-09-27T18:47:03 <Justin_o> jhung: to continue simonjb\'s question.. how would you print the whole site? you\'d manually do it one page at a time?
2016-09-27T18:47:05 <jhung> Justin_o: well most printers have features to split pages, but they just assume you\'re going in order of left-right, top-bottom which isn\'t our case on the reverse side.
2016-09-27T18:47:45 <jhung> simonjb: no we don\'t. This is something we\'d have to build.
2016-09-27T18:47:50 <simonjb> got it
2016-09-27T18:48:02 <jhung> So ideally this is what we\'d want\xe2\x80\xa6
2016-09-27T18:48:23 <simonjb> so I guess a question is: would a non-print-specific all-in-one page be useful?
2016-09-27T18:49:07 <simonjb> and we could try the nth-of-type flipping on the print css for that all-in-one
2016-09-27T18:49:39 <simonjb> or, we just build a print-specific version that has the content suitable ordered for printing
2016-09-27T18:49:56 <simonjb> (which I think was the origin proposal -- right?)
2016-09-27T18:50:23 <simonjb> that is the last one
2016-09-27T18:51:02 <jhung> simonjb: hmmm the nth of type could handle the reverse side ordering. We\'d still need to build an all-in-one page.
2016-09-27T18:51:10 <simonjb> sure
2016-09-27T18:51:28 <jhung> basically every 3rd "page" should appear on the right, and every 4th "page" should appear on the left when printed.
2016-09-27T18:51:37 <jhung> positioned absolutely using print css.
2016-09-27T18:52:12 <simonjb> but we could make an all-in-one, I think, without the need to write a custom parser
2016-09-27T18:52:51 * colinclark joined the channel
2016-09-27T18:52:54 <simonjb> I think we could do it with some new templating and docpad config (we are using docpad, right?)
2016-09-27T18:53:21 <jhung> yeah docpad.
2016-09-27T18:55:09 <jhung> We could use a print template for docpad, the author would still need to manually put in a token or specify where the split is. The split is not in a predictable spot.
2016-09-27T18:55:29 <simonjb> for that we could use <divs>
2016-09-27T18:55:51 <simonjb> <div class="front"> <div class="back">
2016-09-27T18:57:30 <Justin_o> jhung, simonjb: is there a limit to how much content can be on each side?
2016-09-27T18:57:57 <Justin_o> or do we expect the size to be fluid in the print layout?
2016-09-27T18:58:09 <jhung> Justin_o: technically no, but the content author needs to make sure it fits onto a single card side.
2016-09-27T19:02:13 <Justin_o> how will a web author know that?
2016-09-27T19:02:15 <Justin_o> jhung: ^
2016-09-27T19:02:21 <jhung> Justin_o: I don\'t quite understand your question, so I\'m going to guess. :) We\'re going to specify absolute sized 5.5 x8.5" divs for left and right cards. So the user will be constrained in that way.
2016-09-27T19:03:25 <Justin_o> jhung: should we hide the overflow then, so that the author doesn\'t expect there to be a scroll bar
2016-09-27T19:04:19 <Justin_o> jhung: i\'m just getting at the point that the digital view is more flexible, and if you\'re developing in that, you may inadvertently break the print view
2016-09-27T19:04:58 <simonjb> I think the only way to know would be to verify in the print version
2016-09-27T19:05:33 <Justin_o> simonjb: i guess you could constrain the web view to the same limitations
2016-09-27T19:06:00 <Justin_o> simonjb: or we could try to make the print view more flexible.. e.g. fluid layout, but the text could become unreadable and inconsistent
2016-09-27T19:07:01 <simonjb> Justin_o: I think that would be hard, it makes sense that the web view be more flexible in terms of font sizing and such but the print is more rigid due to the need to fit on a specific sized card

2016-09-27T19:16:51 <jhung> simonjb: exactly. The author will need to do some proofing on their end to ensure that everything fits onto the card. I think we\'d clip any content at the div\'s edge and not show any overflow.

2016-09-27T20:44:20 <cindyli> avtar: the log shows the ci job failed at running "npm install", which I re-tried on my machine and worked fine. The log shows the vm is using "node v6.6.0" and "npm v3.10.3". I think our universal repo at the moment sticks with node 4.** and npm v2.**
2016-09-27T20:44:42 <cindyli> but honestly, i don\'t think the newer versions should cause such a big failure
2016-09-27T20:45:03 <cindyli> is there a way i can reproduce the failure

2016-09-27T20:49:45 <avtar> cindyli: you can trigger the job again by adding a \'ok to test\' comment for that pr and see if it fails again at the same place
2016-09-27T20:50:05 <cindyli> avtar: does that help?
2016-09-27T20:50:19 <cindyli> is there any chance that it won\'t fail at the same place

2016-09-27T20:52:17 <avtar> cindyli: there\'s always a chance, \'npm install\' works in mysterious ways :P
2016-09-27T20:52:31 <avtar> to reproduce it locally you would have to follow the steps you already did
2016-09-27T20:52:42 <Bosmon> Hi there Justin_o
2016-09-27T20:52:51 <avtar> as in remove the \'node_modules\' directory and then \'vagrant up\'
2016-09-27T20:53:00 <cindyli> lol. good to know, avtar
2016-09-27T20:53:34 <avtar> you\'ll need to destroy the old vm before attempting the above
2016-09-27T20:54:22 <cindyli> ah ha
2016-09-27T20:55:10 <cindyli> avtar: downloading vm. how big it is
2016-09-27T20:55:21 <cindyli> fedora vm is big as i know
