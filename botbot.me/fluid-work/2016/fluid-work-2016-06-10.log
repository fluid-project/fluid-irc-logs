2016-06-10T13:56:11 <Justin_o> jhung: i\'m trying to get our PhET JT branch merged with the accessible instance branch and then master
2016-06-10T13:56:37 <Justin_o> I\'m thinking that we might want to just ask Jesse to merge this into master when I get it done, to help minimize future merge conflicts
2016-06-10T13:56:40 <Justin_o> what do you think?
2016-06-10T13:58:35 * michelled joined the channel
2016-06-10T14:00:03 * jessm joined the channel
2016-06-10T14:02:59 <jhung> sure Justin_o. Then I guess we\'ll work from master?
2016-06-10T14:03:30 <Justin_o> I\'m not sure, maybe periodic merges still
2016-06-10T14:03:41 <jhung> sure sounds fine Justin_o
2016-06-10T14:04:00 <Justin_o> or maybe we\'ll wait till the base functionality is in place and then ask for the merge.. i think we just need to get the first pass of the scene description in
2016-06-10T14:04:04 <Justin_o> jhung: ^
2016-06-10T14:04:15 <jhung> ok

2016-06-10T14:38:44 <cindyli> Bosmon: in the kettle DataSourcePouchDBTests.js, how do you control tests start when the pouchdb is ready? is it thru this: https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/blob/master/tests/DataSourcePouchDBTests.js#L34
2016-06-10T14:39:21 <cindyli> to start**
2016-06-10T14:42:41 <cindyli> seems yes, reading the comment of gpii.test.express.standardSequenceStart - it defers the start of sequence by 13ms "to avoid any current callbacks"

2016-06-10T20:41:43 <avtar> clown: re: https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-1838
2016-06-10T20:42:16 <avtar> i just wanted to confirm, is this https://github.com/klown/linux/tree/GPII-442 the repo and branch i should be working with?
2016-06-10T20:43:03 * clown checks his github.
2016-06-10T20:44:27 <clown> avtar, yes, but also https://github.com/klown/universal/tree/GPII-442
2016-06-10T20:45:03 <clown> also, the little script in the JIRA gets at the same issue without having to pull in the entire PR (if that helps).
2016-06-10T20:45:07 <avtar> and your fork of universal should be in ../node_modules/universal? relative to where i have the linux working directory?
