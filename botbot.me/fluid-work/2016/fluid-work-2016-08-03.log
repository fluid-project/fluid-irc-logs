2016-08-03T18:39:44 <dinuka> Hi Justin_o .....an infusion Question........
2016-08-03T18:40:10 <dinuka> simonjb: Justin_o ......  is there a way to fire a model change more than one time....... eg:   that.applier.change("value", 23); that.applier.change("value", 23); that.applier.change("value", 23);
2016-08-03T18:40:33 <dinuka> I want the event to be fired three times here
2016-08-03T18:40:49 <dinuka> But, it does only once if the value has not changed
2016-08-03T18:41:21 <dinuka> I just wanted to know whether there is a way provided to change that
2016-08-03T18:41:44 <dinuka> Justin_o: Bosmon simonjb .... Do u know
2016-08-03T18:42:04 <Bosmon> dinuka - no
2016-08-03T18:42:09 <Bosmon> If the model does not change, no event is fired
2016-08-03T18:42:27 <dinuka> thanks Bosmon

2016-08-03T13:41:34 <dinuka> Justin_o: I have a small question..... related to infusion....
2016-08-03T13:41:44 <Justin_o> dinuka: sure
2016-08-03T13:42:30 <dinuka> Is there a way to get the component of an element ...... may be like fluid.getComponent(".selector") which returns the component associate with that if available
2016-08-03T13:43:11 <Justin_o> dinuka: not that I know of.. maybe Bosmon would know
2016-08-03T13:43:16 <Justin_o> dinuka: why did you want to do that?
2016-08-03T13:44:16 * clown joined the channel
2016-08-03T13:44:49 <Bosmon> dinuka - there\'s an indirect way inside FluidViewDebugging.js, but it is a little expensive
2016-08-03T13:44:50 <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/core/js/FluidViewDebugging.js#L574
2016-08-03T13:45:45 <dinuka> when the page loading is done, I want to test them.... that\'s why........
2016-08-03T13:46:02 <dinuka> ah.... I\'l check it out Bosmon
2016-08-03T13:46:03 <Bosmon> dinuka - test.... "them"?
2016-08-03T13:46:54 <dinuka> Bosmon: "them" means infusion components (UI elements)
2016-08-03T13:46:57 <dinuka> :)
2016-08-03T13:47:02 <alanharnum> if you simply want to keep a reference to the components so you can declaratively explore them after creation, you can assign them to variables
2016-08-03T13:47:17 <Bosmon> You can also find them after the fact by a call to fluid.queryIoCSelector()
2016-08-03T13:47:46 <dinuka> yeah alanharnum ..... I just wanted to know whether there is a way provided in infusion
2016-08-03T13:48:59 <Bosmon> http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/IoCAPI.html#fluid-queryiocselector-root-selector-flat-
2016-08-03T13:49:03 <Bosmon> dinuka ^
2016-08-03T13:49:18 <Bosmon> you can simply query the tree for anything matching "fluid.viewComponent"
2016-08-03T13:51:06 * michelled joined the channel
2016-08-03T13:52:45 <dinuka> Bosmon: fluid.queryIoCSelector(document, "#fluid-id-56srdwhg-147")   .....   is this correct
2016-08-03T13:52:49 * yzen joined the channel
2016-08-03T13:53:13 <Bosmon> dinuka - no
2016-08-03T13:53:20 <Bosmon> This queries the component tree, not the DOM
2016-08-03T13:54:22 <dinuka> "#fluid-id-56srdwhg-147" carries an viewComponent..... I want to get it and check it\'s model.. etc
2016-08-03T13:55:38 <dinuka> actually it\'s possible to do this by taking it to a global variable.... I just wanted to ask and see whether there is an easy way provided than that
2016-08-03T14:00:34 <Justin_o> jhung: what\'s the URL for the design cards site
2016-08-03T14:11:47 <alanharnum> Justin_o: I\'m not jhung, but it\'s http://guide.inclusivedesign.ca/
2016-08-03T14:12:02 <Justin_o> alanharnum: thanks :)

2016-08-03T14:16:16 <jhung> thanks proxy_jhung / alanharnum.
2016-08-03T14:16:32 <alanharnum> haha
2016-08-03T14:17:11 <jhung> btw Justin_o, cindyli - you may be interested in seeing Styki\'s progress on UIO mobile so far. He\'s added the blue filter and Image transformations for contrast modes. See his branch here: https://github.com/styki/infusion/tree/Responsive-Design
2016-08-03T14:17:12 <alanharnum> an example of the facade pattern in action i guess
2016-08-03T14:17:38 <jhung> There\'s a bug in webkit where applying the vendor CSS filter to images causes them to randomly disappear.
2016-08-03T14:18:16 <cindyli> thanks, jhung, having a look
2016-08-03T14:21:03 <jhung> also there\'s an error on load in Safari (he\'s fixing it now), but it should load properly in Chrome and FF.
2016-08-03T14:21:07 <jhung> ^cindyli
2016-08-03T14:21:21 <cindyli> cool
2016-08-03T14:28:10 <Justin_o> jhung: looking at it now.. so i guess i don\'t fully understand how it works, as you seem to have to decrease the setting to change the colours
2016-08-03T14:30:26 * bens__ joined the channel
2016-08-03T14:32:55 * Yan_Hu joined the channel
2016-08-03T14:33:38 <jhung> Justin_o: yeah. I think if the slider were inverted it would make more sense (positive applies more of the effect).
2016-08-03T14:33:52 <Justin_o> yes, that\'s what I would expect
2016-08-03T14:34:41 <cindyli> jhung: i didn\'t figure out how the blue filter pref works with high contrast themes. seems it only takes effect with the regular colour pages when a theme is not chosen
2016-08-03T14:38:40 <jhung> cindyli: yes it only works with default. Not with contrast themes.
2016-08-03T14:38:49 <cindyli> ok, jhung
2016-08-03T14:40:04 <jhung> I\'ll pass on these comments to styki
2016-08-03T14:42:56 <the-t-in-rtf> @Bosmon, @cindyli, @simonjb, I realized that the work to disentangle pouchdb from express-pouchdb was related to the idea I had, so I wrote up both.  I will write up the other grade-related work shortly.
2016-08-03T14:45:18 <cindyli> thanks, the-t-in-rtf, can you paste links if they are in jiras?
2016-08-03T14:47:38 <the-t-in-rtf> https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-1897
2016-08-03T14:47:40 <the-t-in-rtf> https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-18976
2016-08-03T14:47:44 <the-t-in-rtf> ignore the last one
2016-08-03T14:47:52 <the-t-in-rtf> https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-1896
2016-08-03T14:47:58 <the-t-in-rtf> https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-1897
2016-08-03T14:48:38 <the-t-in-rtf> They may end up being more or less related, but GPII-1896 is more around fleshing out the underlying PouchDB instances that are currently only exposed via express-pouchdb
2016-08-03T14:49:25 <the-t-in-rtf> where GPII-1897 is about disentangling a few different things from the default gpii.pouchdb grade
2016-08-03T14:49:39 <the-t-in-rtf> startup, teardown, as well as the tight coupling with express-pouchdb
2016-08-03T14:58:09 <the-t-in-rtf> I would imagine GPII-1896 would be done first and then GPII-1897.
2016-08-03T15:02:35 <Justin_o> colinclark: did you have a chance to look at the enhancer lazy loading metrics https://cdn.rawgit.com/jobara/prefsFramework-optimization-examples/debd1f6ac6da992b9368bd144d0e97c879331f21/index.html
