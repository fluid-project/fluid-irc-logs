2016-11-02T20:07:27 <cindyli> danayo: in case you missed my msg earlier, would you have time tomorrow to meet?
2016-11-02T20:08:46 <danayo> cindyli: Yes! I'm avalaible any time
2016-11-02T20:09:09 <danayo> oh wait! i have a meeting with michelled at 2ET
2016-11-02T20:09:25 <danayo> how about 10:30 ET cindyli
2016-11-02T20:10:03 <cindyli> it works for me. Alan and Simon will join it too. they are temporarily offline now. i will check with them
2016-11-02T20:10:08 <danayo> ok
2016-11-02T20:10:39 <cindyli> danayo: btw, do you have the first discovery tool wireframe that has the last step of saving prefs set and returning a token from GPII server?
2016-11-02T20:11:37 <cindyli> i'm going to send an email to all of us with these design information so we can do some homework beforehand
2016-11-02T20:13:48 <danayo> homework cindyli!!
2016-11-02T20:13:52 <danayo> :)
2016-11-02T20:17:34 <danayo> looking for that mockup now cindyli

2016-11-02T20:19:02 <cindyli> thanks
2016-11-02T20:20:30 <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: a couple more issues related to the native HTML sliders with Prefs Framework adjustments https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6018 and https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6017
2016-11-02T20:20:55 <danayo> cindyli I think this is all we have https://www.dropbox.com/s/91s85qk5ralkwvc/FD%20tool%20congrats%20and%20token%20copy.pdf?dl=0
2016-11-02T20:20:58 <Justin_o> these are also borderline blockers as it might be hard to use for someone who has contrast or text size settings enabled, although there is the textfield as a fallback
2016-11-02T20:21:09 <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: ^
2016-11-02T20:21:15 <cindyli> cool. thanks, danayo

2016-11-02T20:25:40 <alanharnum> cindyli: yup, that works for me
2016-11-02T20:25:47 <cindyli> cool. thanks, alanharnum
2016-11-02T20:26:27 <Justin_o> alanharnum: did you see the textfield slider issues i posted above?
2016-11-02T20:26:39 <alanharnum> Justin_o: yup, thanks - taking a look now
2016-11-02T20:26:44 <alanharnum> i think 6017 is pretty easy to deal with
2016-11-02T20:26:45 <Justin_o> still deciding if they are blockers for the release, as there is a fallback with the textfield
2016-11-02T20:26:54 <alanharnum> we just have to size the thumb using EM & It should adjust
2016-11-02T20:28:11 <Justin_o> alanharnum: that seems easy, what about 6018?
2016-11-02T20:28:27 * simonjb_ joined the channel
2016-11-02T20:28:30 <alanharnum> more complicated, but probably not too bad
2016-11-02T20:28:52 <alanharnum> some of it depends on whether technique for styling range inputs has advanced any since this article: https://css-tricks.com/styling-cross-browser-compatible-range-inputs-css/
2016-11-02T20:29:07 <alanharnum> i'll see what I can spike in the next hour or so
2016-11-02T20:29:14 <alanharnum> it may not be too hard to address them both
2016-11-02T20:29:58 <Justin_o> alanharnum: i think if we do one, we should do them both
2016-11-02T20:30:11 <Justin_o> because if we have to test again, we might as well fix it all
2016-11-02T20:30:15 <alanharnum> Justin_o: agreed
2016-11-02T20:32:22 <Justin_o> alanharnum: here's another thing to generate the slider styles, but i don't know how old this one is http://www.cssportal.com/style-input-range/

2016-11-02T20:34:41 <Justin_o> alanharnum: i'm just going to go ahead and make FLUID-6017 and FLUID-6018 blockers. it's in one of our primary components and people are actually using it.
2016-11-02T20:34:49 <alanharnum> ok
2016-11-02T20:34:52 <Justin_o> alanharnum: here's another one we might want to consider fixing as well https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6020
2016-11-02T20:34:55 <Justin_o> thoughts on that?
2016-11-02T20:34:58 <alanharnum> go ahead & assign to me while you're at it
2016-11-02T20:35:02 <Justin_o> okay
2016-11-02T20:35:34 <alanharnum> a fieldset would definitely be an improvement
2016-11-02T20:35:41 <alanharnum> and not too hard to implement
2016-11-02T20:35:54 <Justin_o> okay, i'll add that one as well
2016-11-02T20:35:58 <alanharnum> probably just have to make sure it doesn't apply any styles, and wrap the title as a legend appropriately
2016-11-02T20:36:33 <Justin_o> or add it but hide it from view.. i guess we'll have to see what's most appropriate for it... i haven't dug into the markup and etc yet
2016-11-02T20:39:55 <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: so six more blockers for Infusion 2.0. I've mentioned the issues in the chat above, and also sent an e-mail to the fluid-work list. Feel free to help fixing the issues. You can also keep testing on anything not related to Uploader and the Prefs Framework / UIO

2016-11-02T16:40:51 <cindyli1> the-t-in-rtf: is there a wireframe for the account management with unified listing site?
2016-11-02T16:41:17 <the-t-in-rtf> no.
2016-11-02T16:41:26 <the-t-in-rtf> There was no design bandwidth when it was built.
2016-11-02T16:41:31 <the-t-in-rtf> why do you ask?
2016-11-02T16:42:12 <cindyli1> wanna have some idea of its signup, login process and how the user info is used?
2016-11-02T16:42:28 * cindyli1 is now known as cindyli
2016-11-02T16:43:41 <cindyli> the-t-in-rtf: can i assume its signup, login are similar as this one - https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Preference+Editing+Tools+Design+-+Mockups%2C+Wireframes+and+Diagrams?preview=/34570511/41975811/PMT-login-simplified.pdf
2016-11-02T16:45:30 <the-t-in-rtf> Seems similar.  You\'d mainly need to override the handlebars templates with new markup and then override the existing signup component in gpii-express-user to add a check to enforce clicking "terms and conditions".
2016-11-02T16:45:39 <the-t-in-rtf> With the binder this is not at all difficult.
2016-11-02T16:46:42 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, if you haven\'t already tried the gpii-express-user package, take a look and let me know if you want to pair for a bit.
2016-11-02T16:46:48 <the-t-in-rtf> I can demonstrate changing the markup and adding the check.
2016-11-02T16:47:16 * kasparnet joined the channel
2016-11-02T16:47:22 <the-t-in-rtf> I believe that making the back end enforce the terms & conditions is just a matter of creating a new JSON Schema, which I\'m also happy to go through.
2016-11-02T16:47:59 <cindyli> thanks, the-t-in-rtf. I\'m not thinking that far yet. still collecting requirements :)

2016-11-02T16:54:50 <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: I\'ve found a few accessibility issues with the uploader https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6025, https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6027, and https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6028 I\'m curious about what your opinions are on whether these should constitute blockers for the Infusion 2.0 release. Also note that
2016-11-02T16:54:50 <Justin_o> for FLUID-6027 it\'s likely an issue in other screen readers, but I\'ve only tested with VoiceOver so far.

2016-11-02T18:09:45 <Justin_o> i\'m currently leaning towards making them blockers, but want to know if anyone has a counter opinion
2016-11-02T18:13:58 <alanharnum> Justin_o: +1 on blockers; it also seems these would be relatively straightforward fixes
2016-11-02T18:14:48 <alanharnum> at least based on your comments
2016-11-02T18:15:43 <jhung> Justin_o: +1 as well. FLUID-6028 seems to me to be the most grievous of the three.
2016-11-02T18:22:10 <cindyli> hi danayo, these are the wireframes i found so far. didn\'t find any for first discovery tool yet. can you let me know if they are not the lastest:
2016-11-02T18:22:22 <cindyli> UIO and GPII integration: https://wiki.gpii.net/images/a/a9/Uioptions_GPII_integration.pdf
2016-11-02T18:22:45 <cindyli> PMT: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Preference+Editing+Tools+Design+-+Mockups%2C+Wireframes+and+Diagrams, in the section of \xe2\x80\x9cLog-in and Account Management\xe2\x80\x9d
2016-11-02T18:23:09 <cindyli> I found a meeting notes for first discovery tool + UIO integration: https://wiki.gpii.net/w/UIO_and_First_Discovery_Tool_integration_2015-09-08
2016-11-02T18:24:08 <cindyli> in terms of first discovery tool, is there any plan on how to associate the returned token with an user account?
2016-11-02T18:24:40 <cindyli> danayo: i know u r busy preparing the community meeting. no rush on those questions.
2016-11-02T18:26:44 <danayo> cindyli: I think these are the most recent mockups for UIO GPII integration https://www.dropbox.com/s/i4c3pni6cnnwuts/uioptions%20GPII%20integration.pdf?dl=0
2016-11-02T18:27:04 <cindyli> cool. thanks
2016-11-02T18:28:03 <danayo> Re: first discovery and user accounts, I\'m not sure where that got to from a tech perspective - there were no mockups/designs that I know of

2016-11-02T18:31:17 <Justin_o> jhung, alanharnum: thanks for the input.. let\'s make them blockers
2016-11-02T18:31:39 <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: we have some more blockers, you can keep testing for now, but avoid anything with the uploader and prefs framework / UIO for now
2016-11-02T18:31:48 <Justin_o> we might add a couple UIO issues as blockers as well
