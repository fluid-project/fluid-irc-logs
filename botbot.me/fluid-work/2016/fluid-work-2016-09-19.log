2016-09-19T18:15:24 <Justin_o> Bosmon: so i\'m looking at patching the call to fluid.wrap that you pointed me to
2016-09-19T18:15:28 <jhung> fluid-everyone: I came across this site which teaching programming. You can choose the language you want to use, and you\'re encouraged to do testing. https://www.codingame.com/
2016-09-19T18:15:36 <Bosmon> Justin_o - cool
2016-09-19T18:15:40 <jhung> it\'s similar to code.org, but for a slightly older audience
2016-09-19T18:15:41 <Bosmon> Did you discover why the container had 0 length?
2016-09-19T18:15:44 * yzen joined the channel
2016-09-19T18:16:09 <Justin_o> Bosmon: it seems to be because of this https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/preferences/js/Panels.js#L154
2016-09-19T18:16:38 <Justin_o> i had missed the fact that the that.container was being reassigned, so it can\'t find an element because that.container.selector is undefined
2016-09-19T18:16:51 <Justin_o> originally that.container is correct
2016-09-19T18:16:55 <Justin_o> or has a value
2016-09-19T18:17:58 * kavya joined the channel
2016-09-19T18:18:16 <Bosmon> Justin_o ah ok, right
2016-09-19T18:18:22 <Justin_o> Bosmon: so i\'m thinking that the selector could be 1) containerSpec.selector 2) containerSpec 3) id 4) classes or 5) element name
2016-09-19T18:18:31 <Justin_o> but i don\'t think i can know the context
2016-09-19T18:19:02 <Bosmon> Justin_o - well, you do know the context - since there is no context applied at this point
2016-09-19T18:19:08 <Bosmon> So it has to be the ownerDocument
2016-09-19T18:19:27 <Justin_o> Bosmon: but there could be if it resolved from IoC right?
2016-09-19T18:19:49 <Bosmon> Justin_o - by "context", I mean the 2nd argument to $(selector, context)
2016-09-19T18:20:37 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes.. i guess what i mean is if we are using the class or element name as the selector the original context could have been supplied by a parent component
2016-09-19T18:20:47 <Justin_o> but that may not be visible to us at this time
2016-09-19T18:21:54 <Bosmon> Justin_o - certainly we can\'t guard against the risk of the user having sent in the jQuery object from the outside
2016-09-19T18:22:08 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay... yes that\'s what i was wondering
2016-09-19T18:22:15 <Bosmon> But we can certainly tackle the immediate issue for any selectors which the framework resolves itself via fluid.wrap here
2016-09-19T18:22:16 <Justin_o> so should a context be set at all?
2016-09-19T18:22:38 <Bosmon> Well, it will be helpful to set the context to be the appropriate document object
2016-09-19T18:23:19 <Justin_o> Bosmon: so the issue we had here was with the sub panels. these would be in the iframe
2016-09-19T18:23:40 <Justin_o> is there a reference to that document that i can hook into?
2016-09-19T18:23:59 <Justin_o> or will another argument be needed for fluid.container?
2016-09-19T18:24:44 <Bosmon> Justin_o - of course not
2016-09-19T18:24:51 <Bosmon> We can\'t change the signature of fluid.container
2016-09-19T18:24:56 <Bosmon> It\'s invoked declaratively anyway
2016-09-19T18:25:04 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks :) i was hoping that wouldn\'t be the case
2016-09-19T18:25:08 <Bosmon> It already knows everything that is known anyway
2016-09-19T18:25:12 <Bosmon> Which is not very much
2016-09-19T18:26:59 <Justin_o> Bosmon: you mean to get the document from userJQuery?
2016-09-19T18:27:27 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I think that\'s the only source, isn\'t it
2016-09-19T18:27:39 <Bosmon> We would just assume it is "document" if there isn\'t one
2016-09-19T18:27:52 <Justin_o> okay... thanks
2016-09-19T18:28:05 <Justin_o> Bosmon: what did you think of my selector options listed above
2016-09-19T18:28:06 <Justin_o> ?
2016-09-19T18:29:30 <Bosmon> Justin_o - the selector is whatever string that gets supplied to fluid.wrap, if it is a string
2016-09-19T18:31:08 <Justin_o> Bosmon: right, so don\'t handle the case where a jQuery element is passed in
2016-09-19T18:31:24 <Justin_o> so i\'ll check for containerSpec.selector or containerSpec
2016-09-19T18:31:26 <Justin_o> and that\'s all

2016-09-19T15:51:49 <jhung> whoa that's so strange. Dana and I are in Fluid_standup now.
2016-09-19T15:52:09 <jhung> ^Justin_o
2016-09-19T15:52:20 <Justin_o> strange, don't know what happened there
2016-09-19T15:55:19 <danayo> you must have been in another dimension Justin_o

2016-09-19T15:59:44 <alanharnum> danayo: sorry - I mean we may not have connected the (physical) standup room to the Fluid_standup Vidyo room
2016-09-19T15:59:45 * the-t-in-rtf joined the channel
2016-09-19T16:00:22 <alanharnum> so you and jhung were in the Vidyo room, and we were in the collaboration room talking into microphones to ourselves
2016-09-19T16:00:32 <danayo> right
2016-09-19T16:01:33 <danayo> we figured something must be up
2016-09-19T16:01:51 <jhung> alanharnum: so it's probably not a system error\xe2\x80\xa6 just a simple snubbing of people who are remote. I get it. *sniff*

2016-09-19T16:44:54 <Justin_o> Bosmon: is there a way to get the original selector used during component creation?
2016-09-19T16:45:07 <Justin_o> for a view or renderer component
2016-09-19T16:45:25 <Bosmon> Justin_o - well there is, yes
2016-09-19T16:45:35 <Bosmon> But the scheme isn't enormously reliable
2016-09-19T16:45:40 <Justin_o> oh
2016-09-19T16:45:42 <Bosmon> There's a reason that jQuery withdrew this facility : P
2016-09-19T16:45:49 <Justin_o> :)
2016-09-19T16:45:51 <Bosmon> You need to know both the selector and its scope
2016-09-19T16:46:02 <Bosmon> We did actually restore this feature in our own codebase
2016-09-19T16:46:24 <Bosmon> What is your use case?
2016-09-19T16:46:57 <Justin_o> Bosmon: we did?
2016-09-19T16:47:11 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, long ago
2016-09-19T16:47:16 <Bosmon> Actually we do store the context too
2016-09-19T16:47:16 <Justin_o> Bosmon: looking at upgrading jQuery and this is now throwing an error. https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/preferences/js/Panels.js#L154
2016-09-19T16:47:16 <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/core/js/FluidView.js#L170
2016-09-19T16:47:21 <Justin_o> at least it seems to be
2016-09-19T16:47:29 <Bosmon> So the scheme should be relatively reliable
2016-09-19T16:47:48 <Bosmon> Justin_o - ok, exactly
2016-09-19T16:47:56 <Bosmon> This line appears to be relying precisely on this functionality
2016-09-19T16:48:24 <Bosmon> This code was always going to be a weak point
2016-09-19T16:48:41 <Bosmon> However, I can't see any clear reason for it to break
2016-09-19T16:49:11 <Bosmon> Ah, I guess it could break if the container is initialised from a jQuery which didn't come from a DOM binder
2016-09-19T16:49:57 <Bosmon> https://api.jquery.com/selector/
2016-09-19T16:49:59 <Bosmon> Ah, here we go
2016-09-19T16:50:05 <Bosmon> You weren't testing with jQuery 3.0 by any chance.......
2016-09-19T16:50:20 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes, 3.0
2016-09-19T16:50:22 <Bosmon> Right
2016-09-19T16:50:26 <Bosmon> Well the problem is clear in that case
2016-09-19T16:50:36 <Bosmon> It was deprecated long ago but not removed until now
2016-09-19T16:50:55 <Justin_o> actually 3.1 but same problem
2016-09-19T16:51:50 <Justin_o> so i'm not actually sure where the selector is coming from.. i would have assumed it had been processed through the domBinder because it was for a subPanel
2016-09-19T16:51:56 <Bosmon> Yes
2016-09-19T16:52:05 <Bosmon> Well, see if you can trace it through
2016-09-19T16:52:40 <Bosmon> Once it gets into the system, the code I referenced within the DOM binder should carry on cascading the necessary properties
2016-09-19T16:53:00 * yzen has quit
2016-09-19T16:53:21 <Bosmon> I guess it's possible that someone might have an IoC-resolved selector which happens not to be bound to a DOM-binder element
2016-09-19T16:53:28 <Bosmon> Simply a global one, for example
2016-09-19T16:53:34 <Bosmon> Which looks like what this code is depending on
2016-09-19T16:53:48 * yzen joined the channel
2016-09-19T16:54:03 <Bosmon> Since I see that it ignores the possibility that the selector was run in a context other than the top-level document
2016-09-19T16:54:44 <Justin_o> Bosmon: perhaps it's actually a different issue.
2016-09-19T16:54:55 <Justin_o> so the error occurs when i try to open the sliding panel
2016-09-19T16:55:01 <Bosmon> If this is the case, my suggestion is that we will need to patch the fluid.wrap call on this site: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/core/js/FluidView.js#L105
2016-09-19T16:55:08 <Justin_o> and that.container had length === 0
2016-09-19T16:55:21 <Bosmon> Since this is the other route by which a raw selector might get turned into a container
2016-09-19T16:55:25 <Bosmon> Justin_o - sure
2016-09-19T16:55:31 <Bosmon> It's quite possible we have two problems at once : P
2016-09-19T16:58:29 <Justin_o> Bosmon: could be... i'll try to see why it's not getting a container first.. and then look into patching fluid.wrap if needed...
2016-09-19T16:58:48 <Bosmon> Justin_o - awesome - good luck :)
2016-09-19T17:02:49 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks
