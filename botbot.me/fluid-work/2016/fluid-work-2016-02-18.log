b'2016-02-18T00:09:59 <Justin_o> avtar: are you there?
2016-02-18T00:10:07 <avtar> Justin_o: yes
2016-02-18T00:10:30 <avtar> what\'s up?
2016-02-18T00:10:55 <Justin_o> avtar: hello... i\'m trying to use a USB with a virtualbox vm from ModernIE but it keeps crashing every time I try to connect the USB key to the VM
2016-02-18T00:10:59 <Justin_o> have you run into that before
2016-02-18T00:11:52 <avtar> i haven\'t had it crash but i have had to install the oracle vbox extensions which include usb related features
2016-02-18T00:12:19 <Justin_o> avtar: okay, i think i had installed that into virtual box before, do i have to do that per vm?
2016-02-18T00:12:37 <avtar> it only needs to be installed once but you have to create a usb filter for each vm
2016-02-18T00:13:06 <avtar> that will prevent the host os from accessing the device and instead allow the virtualized os to do so
2016-02-18T00:13:12 <Justin_o> i tried creating a usb filter, but then my vm crashed on load :(
2016-02-18T00:13:36 <avtar> are you starting this using virtualbox?
2016-02-18T00:13:39 <avtar> and not vagrant?
2016-02-18T00:14:50 <Justin_o> yes, just straight virtualbox
2016-02-18T00:16:24 <avtar> does the vm\'s display provide any details related to the crash?
2016-02-18T00:18:22 <Justin_o> virtual box throws an error and then dies.. let me see if i can get that.. i\'m also going to try to update my version of virtualbox,
2016-02-18T00:24:02 <Justin_o> I reinstalled virtualbox and the extension. I think things are getting better, although i couldn\'t connect my usb drive at all this time :)  i\'ll try playing with the settings a bit more tomorrow.
2016-02-18T00:24:09 <Justin_o> thanks for the help

2016-02-18T11:55:33 <simonjb> hey avtar
2016-02-18T11:59:40 <avtar> i heard that airport staff might have thrown a wrench in your travel plans :/
2016-02-18T11:59:57 * gtirloni_ joined the channel
2016-02-18T11:59:57 <avtar> any luck finding your luggage?
2016-02-18T12:01:02 <amatas> ouch, what a ...*$%
2016-02-18T12:04:22 * Justin_o joined the channel
2016-02-18T12:12:15 <simonjb> avtar: yes, I got my luggage yesterday evening -- so good to have clean clothes!
2016-02-18T12:12:40 <avtar> ah nice!
2016-02-18T12:12:51 <avtar> that\'s great to hear :)
2016-02-18T12:14:47 <avtar> how are the presentations going?
2016-02-18T12:14:53 <simonjb> good so far
2016-02-18T12:15:24 <simonjb> haven\'t done QI yet -- soon though, in the next hour or so I think
2016-02-18T12:15:46 <avtar> ok
2016-02-18T12:26:24 <gtirloni> avtar: you should talk to the airline people
2016-02-18T12:29:26 <avtar> gtirloni: in person
2016-02-18T12:30:26 <gtirloni> ah, a small imperceptible requirement that changes this completely
2016-02-18T12:34:57 <amatas> gtirloni, avtar how do you work with the ops repository and the new changes? as is private and I think I\'m not able to make PRs for a review.
2016-02-18T12:35:42 <gtirloni> i think github will allow you to fork it and keep it private
2016-02-18T12:37:27 <amatas> gtirloni, you\'re right, :)
2016-02-18T12:38:33 <gtirloni> initially i had some doubts they would allow this (because you have to pay to have private repos) but they seem to inherent the original repo\'s properties
2016-02-18T12:38:35 <gtirloni> cool
2016-02-18T12:39:23 <amatas> yes, that was my doubt
2016-02-18T12:40:23 <avtar> yeah the forked repository will also be private
2016-02-18T12:50:22 <kasparnet> ping simonjb
2016-02-18T12:51:58 <simonjb> hey kasparnet
2016-02-18T12:52:16 <kasparnet> how are things going?
2016-02-18T12:53:12 <kasparnet> simonjb: I realized i probably screwed up the diagrams a bit yesterday -- they\'re in this folder: https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0ByfE6R0ipKCjQjQzMkpfd3ctTzA&amp=&usp=drive_web&amp=&ddrp=1
2016-02-18T12:53:36 <kasparnet> so the part I think is screwy is the BaseDiagram and preferencesServerSequence ones
2016-02-18T12:53:50 <simonjb> kasparnet: I\'m busy with presentations at the moment -- I can look later in the afternoon
2016-02-18T12:53:55 <kasparnet> ok cool
2016-02-18T12:54:13 <kasparnet> I *think* I understand the flow enough now to diagram it
2016-02-18T12:54:32 <kasparnet> so will do so now - and then perhaps you could look at the updated diagrams later tonight
2016-02-18T12:55:56 <simonjb> kasparnet: can you email me when you\'re ready for me to take another look?
2016-02-18T13:00:49 <kasparnet> sure - and thanks simonjb
2016-02-18T13:12:10 * cindyli joined the channel
2016-02-18T13:15:11 <Justin_o> avtar: just as a follow up from our conversation last night regarding USB drives and virtualbox. I\'ve got it working now. So I updated virtual box and installed the extension. I think I hadn\'t done that on this machine yet. It still didn\'t work, but I believe the issue was related to this https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=69852
2016-02-18T13:16:14 <Justin_o> I have it working now by plugging in the usb through a usb 2.0 hub. It\'d probably have worked if the key didn\'t support usb 3.0 as well. I have the vm setup to use usb 2.0, usb 3.0 didn\'t seem to work for me, but perhaps a few more tries would have fixed that.. not sure
2016-02-18T13:22:10 * michelled joined the channel
2016-02-18T13:25:28 <avtar> hey Justin_o
2016-02-18T13:25:32 <avtar> sorry, i was chatting with simonjb
2016-02-18T13:25:59 <Justin_o> avtar: no worries, i was just updating you on the situation in case it would be helpful later
2016-02-18T13:27:23 * the-t-in-rtf has quit
2016-02-18T13:27:47 <avtar> to be honest, i don\'t use usb devices with vms often but i believe i\'ve had luck with usb 3.0 in the past
2016-02-18T13:28:16 <avtar> if you\'re in the office tomorrow and have the device(s) in question i can take a look at it
2016-02-18T13:28:47 <Justin_o> avtar: i\'ll be remote again tomorrow, but it\'s okay. I have it working as much as I need it now.. so it should be fine
2016-02-18T13:28:57 <Justin_o> thanks though
2016-02-18T13:31:50 * jhung joined the channel
2016-02-18T13:35:31 <avtar> Justin_o: ok let me know if that changes

2016-02-18T15:54:28 <simonjb> main topics: FLOE and P4A, and P4A architecture and "integration"
2016-02-18T15:57:09 <colinclark> thank you simonjb
2016-02-18T15:57:17 <colinclark> these are quite funny notes in some cases
2016-02-18T15:57:23 <colinclark> very familiar :)
2016-02-18T15:57:26 <simonjb> :)
2016-02-18T16:20:05 <simonjb> avtar, colinclark: meeting over for today
2016-02-18T16:21:13 <avtar> simonjb: are you going to be online later or signing off for the day?
2016-02-18T16:26:34 <simonjb> avtar: I\'ll take a break for a bit (pretty tired) but I can sign on again later
2016-02-18T16:26:44 <simonjb> avtar: did you want to chat?
2016-02-18T16:27:22 <avtar> just trying to figure out the schedule for tomorrow
2016-02-18T16:27:36 <avtar> it sounded like things are going to start at 9:00am cet
2016-02-18T16:27:42 <simonjb> avtar: yeah
2016-02-18T16:27:58 <simonjb> until 12pm cet
2016-02-18T16:30:54 <avtar> ok
2016-02-18T16:32:16 <avtar> the 3:00 - 6:00am window here might be a stretch

2016-02-18T18:25:11 <jhung> Justin_o: just a heads up - I\'ve been testing John Travoltage and it\'s a very mixed bag of results.
2016-02-18T18:27:27 <Justin_o> hmm
2016-02-18T18:27:44 <Justin_o> are you documenting that somewhere?
2016-02-18T18:27:52 <jhung> yeah on the wiki Justin_o
2016-02-18T18:29:34 <jhung> Justin_o: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/PhET+Notes
2016-02-18T18:30:28 <Justin_o> jhung: i think role="status" is implicitly an arai-live="polite", if i\'m remembering correctly
2016-02-18T18:31:26 <jhung> Justin_o: I thought so too, but I saw it implemented with aria-live="polite" on paciello group. I\'ll take the aria-live off and see what happens.
2016-02-18T18:32:08 <Justin_o> okay
2016-02-18T18:40:42 <jhung> Justin_o: It shouldn\'t be a surprise to you, but when I remove the aria-live attribute it causes the description to stop being reported in Safari + VO. But it improved responses in Chrome + NVDA.
2016-02-18T18:41:04 <Justin_o> :(
