2016-02-24T18:50:29 * alanharnum joined the channel
2016-02-24T18:50:33 <colinclark> Bind values to models from where?
2016-02-24T18:50:36 <colinclark> anywhere?
2016-02-24T18:50:43 <Bosmon> It does some of what the non-existent renderer\'s binding does, and some of what it doesn\'t do, in a standalone where
2016-02-24T18:51:06 <Bosmon> It binds a view component to the DOM, as the N-E R does in a more half-assed way
2016-02-24T18:52:42 <Justin_o> Bosmon: I haven\'t had any luck with your suggested resolutions.. i tried setting up a model relay with backwards: "liveOnly" and also tried removing the default model value for stickKeysEnabled in the keyboardInput component
2016-02-24T18:52:43 * lliskovoi_ joined the channel
2016-02-24T18:52:59 <Justin_o> i was sure what you meant about the asynchronous option though, so i haven\'t tried anything for that
2016-02-24T18:53:03 <Bosmon> Justin_o - could you check in your adjusted code into a branch?
2016-02-24T18:53:05 <Justin_o> sorry, wasn\'t
2016-02-24T18:53:13 <Bosmon> And I will try that out too
2016-02-24T18:53:20 <Bosmon> I was just in the middle of writing up a JIRA for this
2016-02-24T18:53:51 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay, did you want me to put 1 or both of those things i tried into the branch?
2016-02-24T18:54:12 <Bosmon> Justin_o - just what you have described just not
2016-02-24T18:54:14 <Bosmon> just now
2016-02-24T18:54:17 <Bosmon> With the "liveOnly"
2016-02-24T18:54:22 <Bosmon> And without the default value
2016-02-24T18:54:51 <Justin_o> okay... i\'ll have it up soon

2016-02-24T19:02:47 <Bosmon> Hi there Justin_o - it looks like you adjusted the wrong relay
2016-02-24T19:02:55 <Bosmon> The one causing the problem is the one that leads to the keyboardInput control
2016-02-24T19:03:06 <Bosmon> Which is the one which is currently in the double-creation condition
2016-02-24T19:03:18 <Bosmon> I pasted the link to its relay earlier in the chat here

2016-02-24T19:29:43 <Bosmon> It looks like the corruption of the transaction state is too severe to recover from
2016-02-24T19:30:01 <Bosmon> I wrapped the body of "relayEvents" here in a fluid.invokeLater(), and the problem seems to have gone away

2016-02-24T19:30:39 <Bosmon> Interestingly this is a kind of general problem that reactive frameworks are prone to, which is what led the Facebook React team to prohibit synchronous two-way relay

2016-02-24T19:32:34 <Justin_o> no i didn\'t
2016-02-24T19:32:44 <jhernandez> klown: I also fixed a few problems that affected the UI, so feel free to pull master and give it a try
2016-02-24T19:33:06 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i\'ll try the fluid.invokeLater after the community meeting

2016-02-24T19:55:46 <Bosmon> It looks like it isn\'t to do with the microphones, since it seems they all behave the same
2016-02-24T19:56:01 <Bosmon> And I\'m not sure it\'s to do with Vidyo itself either, since conversations I have with individuals seem fine

2016-02-24T21:29:21 <Justin_o> bens01: was talking to Bosmon earlier in the channel about the issue with reset.
2016-02-24T21:30:23 <bens01> Justin_o, was watching some of that, was this the fix? " I wrapped the body of "relayEvents" here in a fluid.invokeLater(),"
2016-02-24T21:30:42 <Justin_o> bens01: yes, that\'s it  https://botbot.me/freenode/fluid-work/2016-02-24/?msg=60842530&page=2
2016-02-24T21:30:57 <Justin_o> that should take care of the immediate issue with the keyboardInput component
2016-02-24T21:31:09 <Justin_o> bens01: however, there is an additional problem with the confirmation pgae
2016-02-24T21:31:10 <Justin_o> page
2016-02-24T21:31:50 <Justin_o> that should be more straight forward to address though, as it seems the issue are all related to the expectations of values being present. However, we have just cleared all of them out with the reset
2016-02-24T21:32:56 <bens01> that i think uses a model listener, so on clear out it gets triggered, but there are null values in the changeContext
2016-02-24T21:35:16 * jhung1 has quit
2016-02-24T21:35:40 <Bosmon> Yes, there are
2016-02-24T21:35:44 <Bosmon> Because you put them there : P
2016-02-24T21:35:55 <jessm> fluid-everyone: http://simplyaccessible.com/article/the-accessibility-stack/ nice article
2016-02-24T21:36:31 <Justin_o> bens01: you\'re probably getting undefined values because the action before this was to delete all of the model. as part of reset.

2016-02-24T21:37:37 <Bosmon> All the repetitive code in this method would be better implemented using data binding
2016-02-24T21:42:16 <bens01> Bosmon, ala this method? http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/tutorial-gettingStartedWithInfusion/RendererComponents.html
2016-02-24T21:43:45 <Bosmon> bens01 - yes, although there is a rather more lightweight "data binder" going through review right now
2016-02-24T21:43:45 <Bosmon> https://github.com/GPII/gpii-binder/pull/1
2016-02-24T21:44:04 * danayo has quit
2016-02-24T21:44:12 <Bosmon> https://github.com/the-t-in-rtf/gpii-binder/blob/GPII-1579/src/js/binder.js
2016-02-24T21:44:28 <Bosmon> You could lift the implementation from here, it\'s only about 20 lines
2016-02-24T21:45:42 <Bosmon> A light addition would use a stringTemplate action to append the units on the end.... "x" or "wpm"
2016-02-24T21:45:53 <Bosmon> But I believe the project is short of time now, I imagine this will get punted for a bit
2016-02-24T21:47:27 * danayo joined the channel
2016-02-24T21:49:05 <Bosmon> But still, doing something like this might be quicker than the annoyance of adding a changeContext.value === undefined ? "" : changeContext.value.thing  branch to each one of these data binding actions
2016-02-24T21:49:13 <bens01> Bosmon, thank you for that link. This panel is one of the remaining issues we hope to fix with an unrelated...
2016-02-24T21:49:25 <bens01> Bosmon, yep, my thoughts exactly.. while we\'re in there
2016-02-24T21:50:01 <Bosmon> We\'ve been trying to break out the data binding system from the renderer for a long time, but it\'s only been recently that someone had the cycles to look at it
2016-02-24T21:50:26 <Bosmon> If you end up copying this code and making some improvements, please copy them back to the-t-in-rtf on a pull request to him
2016-02-24T21:50:49 <bens01> i haven\'t looked yet if it supports expanders
2016-02-24T21:51:04 <bens01> but that would be great for our usage to concatenate a model value + a unit
2016-02-24T21:51:13 <Bosmon> Yup
2016-02-24T21:51:21 <Bosmon> The units can go into the "long" form of his binding block there
2016-02-24T21:52:23 <Bosmon> A reasonable way to do this would be to add "template" entry there, and make a call to this utility http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/CoreAPI.html#fluid-stringtemplate-template-terms- before you make the $().text call
2016-02-24T21:54:30 <Bosmon> In terms of dealing with initial page load: https://github.com/pga03/first-discovery/blob/sprint3-integration/src/js/panels.js#L1220
2016-02-24T21:54:39 <bens01> that is what one of our devs is working on actually.. but he is out sick. murphy\'s law has made most of us sick in the last 36 hours..
2016-02-24T21:55:35 <Bosmon> A reasonable way of avoiding notification during construction is to add the    excludeSource: "init" annotation to this block
2016-02-24T21:55:40 <Bosmon> Which is described in the docs here: http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/ChangeApplierAPI.html#source-tracking-and-filtering-in-model-listener-blocks
2016-02-24T21:56:25 <Bosmon> This will avoid the unsightly 500ms timeout that you currently have at the head : P
2016-02-24T21:56:34 <Bosmon> But moving this to a "binder" like system will make this all moot anyway
2016-02-24T21:57:08 <bens01> yes that seems best

2016-02-24T16:15:22 <Justin_o> bens01: I won\'t be able to make it to the Standup today and will only have limited time to do testing this afternoon. Could you let me know if anything comes up at the meeting today?
2016-02-24T16:17:43 <bens01> Justin_o, will do. biggest change this morning is that these are resolved: 1) tab to language list puts focus on selected language 2) TTS warnings when reaching max and min values on ranged panels (text size, line spacing, etc)
2016-02-24T16:18:19 <Justin_o> bens01: cool thanks.. has FD been redeployed?
2016-02-24T16:18:20 * cindyli joined the channel
2016-02-24T16:18:23 <bens01> Justin_o, we are working through the other items tagged high priority by Michelle
2016-02-24T16:18:35 <bens01> Justin_o, yes, redeployed with those
2016-02-24T16:18:53 <Justin_o> bens01: thanks.. i\'ll go through and retest those first.
2016-02-24T16:19:53 <bens01> Justin_o, additionally, there is logging on the FD-server now so if the http 502 comes up again we can troubleshoot more. There is also gzip compression on FD-server load times are improved
2016-02-24T16:20:21 <Justin_o> bens01: that\'s awesome

2016-02-24T16:37:29 <Bosmon> Hi Justin_o
2016-02-24T16:37:48 <Bosmon> So I have reproduced the problem with the ctrl-alt-r keybinding you described to me
2016-02-24T16:38:01 <Bosmon> As you suspected, this is caused by destroying a component before it has finished constructing
2016-02-24T16:38:09 <Bosmon> That is, the "keyboardInput" component
2016-02-24T16:38:23 <Bosmon> I\'m just looking in to why this is happening, but presumably you have some clues
2016-02-24T16:38:23 * gtirloni joined the channel
2016-02-24T16:38:58 <Bosmon> I think this would be a failure in any case, although one would hope that we can get the framework to produce a more helpful diagnostic than it currently does
2016-02-24T16:39:13 <Bosmon> Do you have an idea why the keyboardInput component would be destroyed before it is constructed?
2016-02-24T16:39:48 <Bosmon> Oh yes, I see something worrying
2016-02-24T16:40:01 <Bosmon> There are two recursive calls to "gpii.firstDiscovery.panel.keyboard.relayEvents"
2016-02-24T16:40:32 <Bosmon> Caused, in turn, by two recursive calls to the component\'s "refreshView" method
2016-02-24T16:40:56 <Bosmon> Which, themselves, in turn, are caused by two recursive calls to "saveAndApply"
2016-02-24T16:41:35 * sepidehshahi has quit
2016-02-24T16:43:22 <Bosmon> So, in the first change, the model is being cleared
2016-02-24T16:43:40 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2016-02-24T16:44:06 * colinclark has quit
2016-02-24T16:44:43 <Bosmon> I\'m puzzled about the distinction you have in "relayEvents" between offerAsistance being false, and being undefined
2016-02-24T16:45:49 * jhung is now known as jhung_away
2016-02-24T16:48:32 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yah, that component has a strange construction that could probably be refined at some point. It\'s basically done to represent this tri-state it has where it starts by providing the user with an opportunity to test if they need the accomodation
2016-02-24T16:48:39 <Justin_o> i should be "test" in quotes
2016-02-24T16:48:47 <Bosmon> In the second change, the model is attempting to initialise with gpii_firstDiscovery_stickyKeys: false
2016-02-24T16:49:46 <Bosmon> This looks like a mistake, given the purpose of the overall change is to clear the model
2016-02-24T16:49:49 <Justin_o> Bosmon: the curious bit is that this all worked in the prior version of the FD tool, http://build.fluidproject.org/first-discovery/demos/prefsServerIntegration/
2016-02-24T16:50:01 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes, that would seem like an error
2016-02-24T16:50:30 <Bosmon> This is what kicks off the 2nd round of changes whilst the first is still in place
2016-02-24T16:50:52 <Justin_o> Bosmon: could it be related to the relay working backwards from one of the sub components
2016-02-24T16:51:55 <Justin_o> so maybe the parent model is reset, but the model from the subcomponent hadn\'t finished relaying its model change up yet?
2016-02-24T16:55:35 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, my best initial guess is that the spurious model contents are caused by this default value here: https://github.com/pga03/first-discovery/blob/sprint3-integration/src/js/keyboardInput.js#L94
2016-02-24T16:56:10 <Justin_o> Bosmon: that should be undefined?
2016-02-24T16:56:12 <Bosmon> I imagine that as the fresh instance of this component starts to construct, it tries to relay this value back to the root model
2016-02-24T16:56:34 <Bosmon> Justin_o - either it should be undefined, or the default relay rule in the builder should not try to relay it back
2016-02-24T16:56:39 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay, but why did this all work before?
2016-02-24T16:57:34 <Justin_o> Bosmon: that one is the preference value though, so it does need to be communicated.. maybe liveOnly though
2016-02-24T16:57:51 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, it should be liveOnly
2016-02-24T16:57:58 <Bosmon> I\'m trying to find the relay rule responsible for this
2016-02-24T16:58:11 <Bosmon> Do you happen to know where they live?
2016-02-24T16:59:51 <Bosmon> Ah here it is
2016-02-24T16:59:55 <Bosmon> Yes, it is an implicit relay rule
2016-02-24T17:00:25 <Bosmon> https://github.com/pga03/first-discovery/blob/sprint3-integration/src/js/panels.js#L288
2016-02-24T17:00:26 <Bosmon> Here it is
2016-02-24T17:00:46 <Bosmon> So this rule tries to relay the value "false" back to the root model, whilst the transaction is still in progress trying to clear the model
2016-02-24T17:00:51 <Bosmon> This then causes general chaos
2016-02-24T17:02:27 <Bosmon> The system self-reacts, and tries to recreate the keyboardInput component in response to a 2nd "onInitInput" event whilst the 1st one is still in the process of notifying its listeners
2016-02-24T17:02:37 <Bosmon> You will see two firings of "onInitInput" on the stack which is clearly a mistake
2016-02-24T17:03:07 <Bosmon> There are several ways to work around this, although the framework should have given you an immediate diagnostic when you tried to destroy a component whilst it was still creating
2016-02-24T17:03:28 <Bosmon> Firstly, you can rewrite the relay rule to be explicit and only relay forwards rather than backwards
2016-02-24T17:03:35 <Bosmon> Secondly, you could just remove the initial default value
2016-02-24T17:04:10 <Bosmon> THirdly, you could make the operation of gpii.firstDiscovery.panel.keyboard.relayEvents asynchronous so that it waits for the current model transaction to complete before it attempts to start a fresh one
2016-02-24T17:04:26 <Bosmon> I think any of these three schemes would make the problem go away
2016-02-24T17:04:41 <Bosmon> In the meantime I can write this up as an area where we can improve diagnostics

2016-02-24T17:05:11 * michelled has quit
2016-02-24T17:05:24 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks
2016-02-24T17:05:35 <Bosmon> There are two faults going on at the same time - firstly, there is a second "init transaction" going on whilst another it still in progress on the same components
2016-02-24T17:05:46 <Bosmon> secondly, a component was destroyed before it got to the end of its construction phase
2016-02-24T17:05:55 <Justin_o> i\'ll try some of those options when i get back later.. cindy and I did try to change the model relay rules before and used backward never, but it was still failing at the same place... i\'ll try some more later though

2016-02-24T18:47:06 <colinclark> Bosmon: What is a "GPII binder?"
2016-02-24T18:47:37 <Bosmon> colinclark - it\'s a packaging of some DOM binding code I wrote once which is being managed and improved by the-t-in-rtf
2016-02-24T18:47:51 <Bosmon> Somewhat different to some DOM binding code I wrote on two other occasions....
2016-02-24T18:48:21 <Bosmon> Particularly, this deals with binding values to models
2016-02-24T18:48:28 <Bosmon> Rather than binding to the DOM in general
