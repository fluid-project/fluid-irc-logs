2016-11-29T19:59:21 <cindyli> avtar: i\'m thinking you probably are the better person to review this pull request - https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/490, since the change affects the VM that initially created by you. what do you think?
2016-11-29T20:00:07 <cindyli> if the change works well, you can leave a comment on the pull request for Bosmon/Bosmon5 or someone has push access to GPII/universal to merge
2016-11-29T20:02:04 <avtar> cindyli: i\'ll check that pr in a few mins, doing an interview at the moment
2016-11-29T20:02:23 <cindyli> sorry\xe2\x80\xa6. and thanks, avtar :)

2016-11-29T20:18:59 <colinclark> simonjb: This is ready for your scrutiny and creative ideas: https://github.com/colinbdclark/flocking-midi/tree/gh-1
2016-11-29T20:19:17 <simonjb> awesome colinclark I will take a look
2016-11-29T20:19:25 <colinclark> It really doesn\'t do much
2016-11-29T20:19:28 <colinclark> there is also one caveat
2016-11-29T20:19:38 <colinclark> It\'s a kind of "unsuccessful monorepo"
2016-11-29T20:20:00 * the-t-in-rtf joined the channel
2016-11-29T20:20:01 <colinclark> In that I believe, at the moment, these modules totally unusable outside of the context of their repository
2016-11-29T20:20:14 <colinclark> I was summarizing the issues to the-t-in-rtf last week
2016-11-29T20:20:31 <colinclark> but in short we\'re going to need some additional tooling in fluid-publish, I think
2016-11-29T20:21:06 <colinclark> in order to synthesize an appropriate "dependencies" block, at very least
2016-11-29T20:22:00 <colinclark> I realize that this may make your life rather difficult, simonjb :)
2016-11-29T20:22:48 <simonjb> but I can just use the whole repo together?
2016-11-29T20:23:31 <simonjb> or at least require() the bits I need?

2016-11-29T20:51:26 <Bosmon5> cindyli - yes, I think gpii-diagrams is a good idea
2016-11-29T20:51:36 <Bosmon5> cindyli - ok, I will test your pull 490
2016-11-29T20:52:01 <Bosmon5> Justin_o, colinclark - yes, I guess that my original copyright attribution was incorrect, I wasn\'t employed in the capacity of Lucendo Development in 2014
2016-11-29T20:52:05 <cindyli> Bosmon5: avtar is going to look at the pull 490 and make a comment if things work well
2016-11-29T20:52:19 <Bosmon5> Well, of course, actually I was
2016-11-29T20:52:19 <cindyli> then you can merge it, Bosmon5
2016-11-29T20:52:32 <Justin_o> Bosmon5: thanks, i\'ll update that
2016-11-29T20:52:35 <Bosmon5> But I guess that copyright is assigned to who I was contracted to
2016-11-29T20:52:42 <Bosmon5> I really have no understanding of these things
2016-11-29T20:53:04 <Justin_o> Bosmon5: it\'s really confusing eh, i wish we could simplify the process
2016-11-29T20:53:31 <Bosmon5> Well, we could just ignore it :)
2016-11-29T20:53:43 <Justin_o> Bosmon5, colinclark: would it be enough to just say, go look at the commit history?
2016-11-29T20:53:46 <Justin_o> it\'s all public
2016-11-29T20:54:40 <cindyli> Bosmon5: do you mind to create the initial GPII/gpii-diagrams repo then I can send a pull request for ppl to review?
2016-11-29T20:54:53 <Justin_o> Bosmon5, colinclark: although i guess that doesn\'t show copyright attribution
2016-11-29T20:54:53 <cindyli> would that be easier than I create my own gpii-diagrams repo
2016-11-29T20:55:23 <Justin_o> Bosmon5: also if i find other instances like module.js should i go change them, or would you like to review first?
2016-11-29T20:55:23 <cindyli> then transfer the ownership later on
2016-11-29T20:56:03 <Bosmon5> cindyli ok, but didn\'t we make a repo like this already?
2016-11-29T20:56:08 <Bosmon5> Justin_o sure, just change them
2016-11-29T20:56:20 <colinclark> I don\'t see any reason why we can\'t create a contributors file
2016-11-29T20:56:27 <Justin_o> Bosmon5: thanks, i\'ll do that
2016-11-29T20:56:35 <colinclark> and then attribute copyright to "the contributors"
2016-11-29T20:56:42 <colinclark> i\'d have to look into it a little bit
2016-11-29T20:56:50 <Bosmon5> cindyli ah, it\'s gpii-payloads
2016-11-29T20:56:51 <cindyli> Bosmon5: no, we don\'t have such repo named "gpii-diagrams"
2016-11-29T20:56:54 <cindyli> right
2016-11-29T20:57:05 <colinclark> but if we\'re spending tons of time trying to keept this updated, it doesn\'t seem like a great use of time
2016-11-29T20:57:17 <Bosmon5> Seems a bit funny to have so many repositories just "per resource type"
2016-11-29T20:57:26 <Justin_o> colinclark: yah, i might be biased, but i\'d agree ;)
2016-11-29T20:57:27 <Bosmon5> How about we create a repo named gpii-architecture-docs
2016-11-29T20:57:50 <Bosmon5> And merge payloads and diagrams into it
2016-11-29T20:57:51 <Justin_o> colinclark: is that something we should add to our post 2.0 work, or do you think we should look into making the change now
2016-11-29T20:57:59 <cindyli> sounds good to me, Bosmon5
2016-11-29T20:59:14 <colinclark> Justin_o: post
2016-11-29T20:59:34 <colinclark> and I think I wouldn\'t sweat updating the files too much
2016-11-29T20:59:46 <colinclark> do what is a basic pass through, just to see
2016-11-29T20:59:49 <colinclark> and then, well, you know
2016-11-29T20:59:50 <colinclark> ship it :)
2016-11-29T21:00:05 <Bosmon5> colinclark - do you like gpii-architecture-docs ?
2016-11-29T21:00:36 <colinclark> sure, that seems fine
2016-11-29T21:03:37 <Bosmon5> cindyli - here it is - https://github.com/GPII/gpii-architecture-docs
2016-11-29T21:03:41 <colinclark> Justin_o: Interestingly, Node.js for example does not even have copyright headers in their files
2016-11-29T21:03:46 <colinclark> they have an AUTHORS file
2016-11-29T21:03:54 <colinclark> and a LICENSE file, which is attributed to "Copyright Node.js contributors. All rights reserved."
2016-11-29T21:03:55 <Bosmon5> We should merge gpii-payloads into this in a suitable subdirectory
2016-11-29T21:04:04 <cindyli> cool. thanks, Bosmon5. will do
2016-11-29T21:04:08 <Justin_o> colinclark: https://softwarefreedom.org/resources/2012/ManagingCopyrightInformation.html
2016-11-29T21:04:20 <Justin_o> colinclark: according to that, either are fine, and even none at all
2016-11-29T21:05:05 <Bosmon5> Cool
2016-11-29T21:05:15 <Bosmon5> Well this sounds like a great opportunity to cut down on a lot of commit noise :)
2016-11-29T21:05:19 <Justin_o> colinclark: sounds like the main advantage of the copyright notice at all are 1) for recognizing developers 2) preventing someone for claiming innocence when they infringe on your copyright
2016-11-29T21:06:13 <Justin_o> all of which could be accomplished by looking at GitHub.
2016-11-29T21:06:49 <Justin_o> although, 3rd party copyright notices are probably still required, and I think i\'ve come across one
2016-11-29T21:10:28 <colinclark> yes
2016-11-29T21:10:32 <colinclark> you definitely don\'t want to remove those
2016-11-29T21:20:40 <Bosmon5> I\'m really enjoying my YYYARN experiences
2016-11-29T21:20:44 <Bosmon5> It\'s easily 3x faster than npm

2016-11-29T21:35:27 <Bosmon5> Thanks, cindyli
2016-11-29T21:35:36 <Bosmon5> Did we decide we would check in SVG versions of the diagrams also?

2016-11-29T21:49:58 <cindyli> Bosmon5: i think we decided not to check in svg versions for now. i think that makes sense since it save us from maintaining 2 versions of one same diagram
2016-11-29T21:51:28 <colinclark> Bosmon5: I was worried when you mentioned problems
2016-11-29T21:51:46 <colinclark> since simonjb and I had done some testing on Flocking and midi-related projects and it was pretty hot
2016-11-29T21:52:03 <colinclark> there was a bug in the previous version, but I had great success compiling native node modules in Windows
2016-11-29T21:52:10 <colinclark> and now it\'s pretty easy to get the MS build tools
2016-11-29T21:52:15 <colinclark> you can just npm or yarn install them :)

2016-11-29T22:11:36 <simonjb> colinclark: got my issue resolved with missing isPortOpen() function -- was simply that I had the wrong midi library (I had 2 competing ones: top level and dependency of flocking; and was taking one from flocking)
2016-11-29T22:11:45 <colinclark> ack!
2016-11-29T22:11:53 <gloob> so finally I should use yarn?

2016-11-29T17:35:45 <clown> that was the part of the proccess reporter that kasparnet aske me to remove.
2016-11-29T17:35:55 <stegru> heh
2016-11-29T17:36:01 <clown> and that Bosmon suggested be folded into infusion.
2016-11-29T17:36:10 <clown> which I am working on.
2016-11-29T17:36:37 <clown> stegru:  who or what needs it now?
2016-11-29T17:36:43 <stegru> gloob:
2016-11-29T17:36:56 <clown> hey gloob, are you watching processes?
2016-11-29T17:37:15 * kasparnet has quit
2016-11-29T17:37:19 <stegru> there is currently a function that waits until a process dies
2016-11-29T17:39:47 <clown> is it this, stegru?  https://github.com/stegru/windows/blob/GPII-2073/gpii/node_modules/WindowsUtilities/WindowsUtilities.js#L703
2016-11-29T17:40:33 <gloob> clown: aha
2016-11-29T17:40:39 <gloob> clown: you are doing zombie stuff
2016-11-29T17:41:24 <gloob> clown: I was just talking with stegru to know where we are with the full lifecycle of set settings
2016-11-29T17:42:40 <clown> gloob, I\'m not sure I know about the full lifecycle.
2016-11-29T17:43:39 <gloob> and who knows?
2016-11-29T17:43:40 <gloob> :D
2016-11-29T17:43:50 <gloob> we are building all the pieces here, I think
2016-11-29T17:43:59 <clown> Bosmon, he knows everything ;-)
2016-11-29T17:44:04 <gloob> Bosmon5: !!!
2016-11-29T17:44:43 <clown> gloob, if we are talking about all of the pieces, then maybe the lifecyclemanager is involved.
2016-11-29T17:44:50 <gloob> I think for apply settings we have two or three modes
2016-11-29T17:44:58 <gloob> clown: probably
2016-11-29T17:45:21 * clown looks up lifecyclemanager
2016-11-29T17:45:23 <gloob> but I want to discuss about which are the way for apply settings of an external application we support now
2016-11-29T17:45:31 <gloob> what came to my mind is
2016-11-29T17:45:55 <gloob> 1) Set setting and restart app (that means, to kill it watch slowly dies and restart it)
2016-11-29T17:46:29 <gloob> 2) Set settings dynamically if available
2016-11-29T17:46:45 <gloob> 3) any other way?
2016-11-29T17:48:23 * scott_gonzalez has quit
2016-11-29T17:48:43 * scott_gonzalez joined the channel
2016-11-29T17:49:02 <clown> gloob, off hand either an app is sensitive to live settings updates, or it isn\'t (and needs a restart).  I can\'t think of a third case.
2016-11-29T17:49:06 * clown thinks some more
2016-11-29T17:50:44 <clown> gloob, for your first case (Set setting and restart app (that means, to kill it watch slowly dies and restart it), is it that you want to be sure the app has quit before you start it again?
2016-11-29T17:53:55 <stegru> you can call gpii.windows.closeProcessByName("notepad"), this returns a promise that resolves when the process is dead

2016-11-29T17:59:15 <gloob> stegru: yes, it sounds the way to go, that works now?
2016-11-29T17:59:48 <gloob> stegru: I visited that code but currently I cannot recall
2016-11-29T17:59:57 <gloob> fish memory here
2016-11-29T18:00:08 <Bosmon5> stegru, gloob et al - we currently have no infrastructure at all for restarting applications when their settings change
2016-11-29T18:00:15 <gloob> Bosmon5: !!!
2016-11-29T18:00:20 <Bosmon5> "not an electronic sausage"
2016-11-29T18:00:23 <Bosmon5> Nothing, nada
2016-11-29T18:00:25 <gloob> Bosmon5: haha, thanks
2016-11-29T18:01:50 <gloob> as kasparne_ will say "nichts"
2016-11-29T18:02:49 <gloob> ok, stegru clown and Bosmon5 thank you for clarification I will be back to my cave then

2016-11-29T18:03:37 <gloob> Bosmon5: it seems we have all the pieces but we need to connect them in some solid api, riht?
2016-11-29T18:04:48 <Bosmon5> Yes, in theory we know the "start" and "stop" actions for the app
2016-11-29T18:04:52 <gloob> wow, pcp and pmt were alive in 2014
2016-11-29T18:05:06 <Bosmon5> They were roughly as alive as they are now :)
2016-11-29T18:05:11 <gloob> :D
2016-11-29T18:06:04 <Bosmon5> gloob - not quite, we also need https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-631

2016-11-29T18:07:23 <gloob> Bosmon5: ok, I see
2016-11-29T18:07:46 <gloob> Bosmon5: but GPII-631 doesn\'t seems hard
2016-11-29T18:08:05 <gloob> I think the API and implementation are more painful, probably, no?
2016-11-29T18:09:13 <Bosmon5> gloob - well, sort of the same
2016-11-29T18:09:35 <Bosmon5> What\'s harder is the TEST CASES :)
2016-11-29T18:10:04 <Bosmon5> We\'ll need a new pathway within the LifecycleManager, and need to actually have any tests at all for the "update" action
2016-11-29T18:11:12 <gloob> Bosmon5: right
2016-11-29T18:11:21 <Bosmon5> Well ok, we do have at least some tests for them
2016-11-29T18:11:44 <Bosmon5> At the LifecycleManager level
2016-11-29T18:11:51 <Bosmon5> but at the FlowManager level we have essentially nothing

2016-11-29T18:12:44 <Bosmon5> gloob - are you considering some particular application and some particular settings, in the context of our pilots?
2016-11-29T18:13:00 <gloob> Bosmon5: yes
2016-11-29T18:13:09 <Bosmon5> gloob - WHICH ARE THEY!
2016-11-29T18:13:12 <gloob> Bosmon5: I\'m thinking about differents scenarios onboarding ATs
2016-11-29T18:13:20 <gloob> Bosmon5: well, it SEEMS
2016-11-29T18:13:20 <Bosmon5> DIFFERENT ONES!
2016-11-29T18:13:56 <gloob> Bosmon5: we are onboarding first all the windows accessibility settings, and probably some magic with Word and probably assure JAWS and probably check others
2016-11-29T18:14:44 <gloob> Bosmon5: I want to review if we can onboard all of this https://github.com/gloob/gpii-settings/blob/master/Platforms/Windows/win10/settings_simplified.csv
2016-11-29T18:15:12 <gloob> some are just applied with the registry, others needs to trigger an app or system running process etc...
2016-11-29T18:16:53 <gloob> I need to gotta go
2016-11-29T18:17:33 <Bosmon5> gloob - what is in this CSV?

2016-11-29T18:37:37 <cindyli> Bosmon, Bosmon5, can you help to review this pull request - https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/490

2016-11-29T18:50:30 <Bosmon5> Hi cindyli - I have no idea how to review that pull request :)
2016-11-29T18:50:46 <Bosmon5> What does it even do? : P

2016-11-29T18:53:04 <cindyli> Bosmon5: that change affects the provisioning of the VM that runs GPII in the production mode.
2016-11-29T18:53:23 <cindyli> the review needs to confirm the VM is still provisioned correctly
2016-11-29T18:53:26 <cindyli> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/documentation/ProductionSetupInstructions.md#start-the-vm
2016-11-29T18:53:48 <cindyli> in this doc, follow:
2016-11-29T18:53:50 <cindyli> 1. start the VM
2016-11-29T18:54:20 <cindyli> if you ever started this vm before, in the step 1, you will have to do

2016-11-29T18:56:22 <cindyli> fun -> run, typo
2016-11-29T18:58:08 <clown> cindyli, I think you were right the first time:  "all the vagrant commands need to be fun"  ;-)
2016-11-29T18:58:20 <cindyli> lol
2016-11-29T18:58:22 <cindyli> good point

2016-11-29T19:09:57 <cindyli> Bosmon, Bosmon5, thinking about the new "gpii-diagrams" github repo. do you think it makes sense to first init GPII/gpii-diagrams repo, then I fork it and send pull request with diagrams to be reviewed and merged?

2016-11-29T19:49:44 <colinclark> the answer is no
2016-11-29T19:50:11 <colinclark> copyright should never be changed like that unless there\'s some kind of attribution agreement in place
2016-11-29T19:50:12 <Justin_o> colinclark: okay thanks, he had told me that he was Raising the Floor - US for 2012 - early 2014 before
2016-11-29T19:50:40 <colinclark> ok
2016-11-29T19:51:12 <Justin_o> wanted to know if this was a mistake or actually should be filed under Lucendo
2016-11-29T19:51:16 <colinclark> yeah, ok
2016-11-29T19:51:18 <colinclark> that makes sense
2016-11-29T19:51:20 <colinclark> i\'ll let him confirm
2016-11-29T19:51:27 <Justin_o> i\'ll leave it for now unless he says it should be changed
2016-11-29T19:51:29 <Justin_o> cool thanks

2016-11-29T17:27:55 <stegru> as far as I\'m aware, yes
2016-11-29T17:28:30 <gloob> stegru: I mean, we have registry and spi settings handler right
2016-11-29T17:29:00 <stegru> yes, gloob
2016-11-29T17:29:18 <gloob> stegru: they are both dynamic? meaning, we have a way to relaunch the app if needed?
2016-11-29T17:29:42 <stegru> i\'m not sure what you mean by that
2016-11-29T17:29:44 <gloob> well, processHandling should do that
2016-11-29T17:30:07 <gloob> stegru: well, imagine we have an application we want to change dynamically the settings
2016-11-29T17:30:26 <gloob> but it needs to be restarted to get the settings aplied
2016-11-29T17:30:47 <stegru> oh I see what you mean - yes, processHandling can do that
2016-11-29T17:31:17 <gloob> stegru: ok, thanks, I just wanted to double check my assumptions
2016-11-29T17:31:53 <stegru> gloob: but, i\'m not sure if it could restart an application. You\'d have to kill it, then wait for it to shutdown before starting it again
2016-11-29T17:32:23 <stegru> if the rules are sequential, then it would be ok I think
