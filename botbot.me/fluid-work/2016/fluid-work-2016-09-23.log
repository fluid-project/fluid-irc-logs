b"2016-09-23T18:54:03 <colinclark> ok
2016-09-23T18:54:06 <colinclark> that was my next question :)
2016-09-23T18:54:21 <colinclark> So the server's running and you can indeed connect to it
2016-09-23T18:54:22 <kavya> :)
2016-09-23T18:54:39 <kavya> but i coudn't not connect it through eggplant
2016-09-23T18:54:42 <colinclark> ok
2016-09-23T18:54:56 <colinclark> So how does eggPlant get configured?
2016-09-23T18:55:06 <colinclark> and what kind of configuration did you specify for it?
2016-09-23T18:56:24 <kavya> http://docs.testplant.com/?q=content/creating-connection-eggPlant-Functional
2016-09-23T18:57:07 <kavya> Please click on the link and if you scroll down there is screenshot of eggplant UI
2016-09-23T18:57:45 <kavya> Where i need to give connection details
2016-09-23T18:58:14 <kavya> I tried with same credentials i used for VNC viewer but it didnt worked
2016-09-23T18:58:38 <kavya> tried with all possible options as well
2016-09-23T18:58:50 <colinclark> I wonder if it has to do with limitations in the RealVNC server?
2016-09-23T18:59:26 <kavya> for that i changed preferences in eggplant for vnc and unchecked all options
2016-09-23T18:59:39 <kavya> let me give you a screenshot
2016-09-23T19:00:21 <kavya> http://docs.testplant.com/ePF/using/epf-connections-preferences.htm
2016-09-23T19:01:00 <avtar> kavya: i wonder if opting for rdp first might be a better option since it removes the need for installing this vnc server
2016-09-23T19:01:06 <avtar> and all the added configuration
2016-09-23T19:01:56 <kavya> yes avtar, i tried rdp as well but it didnt work
2016-09-23T19:02:30 <avtar> were you able to connect from your host os or was it eggplant that didn't work?
2016-09-23T19:03:45 <kavya> eggplant didnt work
2016-09-23T19:04:48 <avtar> did it log any errors?
2016-09-23T19:05:56 <kavya> avtar:do you have some time today or on monday where you can have a look on my environment
2016-09-23T19:06:20 <kavya> Error its givin is connection failed
2016-09-23T19:12:36 <avtar> kavya: unfortunately i don't think i'll have time to do any in-depth troubleshooting today
2016-09-23T19:12:46 <avtar> i was taking a look at eggplant requirements and it seems a license is needed before it can be used
2016-09-23T19:13:13 <kavya> yes,Eggman can be downloaded for 5 day trail
2016-09-23T19:13:44 <kavya> np,avtar. let me know if you are available on monday
2016-09-23T19:14:14 <avtar> if you start early i would suggest pinging alfredo ('amatas' on irc) on monday for remote assistance
2016-09-23T19:14:40 <avtar> otherwise we can try it out on wednesday during the arch meeting
2016-09-23T19:15:41 <kavya> sure,i will try on monday to solve this with Alfredo Help or we can do it on wednesday
2016-09-23T19:16:46 <avtar> kavya: sounds good
2016-09-23T19:17:04 <kavya> Avtar: Colin: Thank you :)
2016-09-23T19:17:13 <colinclark> not sure I helped much :)
2016-09-23T19:17:16 <colinclark> but I'm always happy to try
2016-09-23T19:20:45 <kavya> he he :)

2016-09-23T15:01:26 <colinclark> alanharn_, Justin_o: Here\'s the article about technical debt and legacy code refactoring that I mentioned yesterday, which michelled sent me a while ago: http://firstround.com/review/forget-technical-debt-heres-how-to-build-technical-wealth/
2016-09-23T15:01:37 <cindyli> Bosmon, colinclark, simonjb, ready to meet? in my vidyo room
2016-09-23T15:01:39 <alanharn_> thanks colinclark / michelled
2016-09-23T15:03:15 <colinclark> The really interesting part for me was extending the definition of legacy code from not just untested code to also code "that lacks explanation, that contains zero artifacts of your ideas and decision-making processes"
2016-09-23T15:03:25 <colinclark> Very reminiscent of an open source approach
2016-09-23T15:04:47 <alanharn_> colinclark: for me, that\'s always been one of the strongest arguments in favour of open source as a quality assurance practice
2016-09-23T15:05:32 <alanharnum> i\'m of the opinion that even proprietary software should be open source, and that this should be legally mandated
2016-09-23T15:06:10 <alanharnum> especially as software increasingly replaces formerly analog, inherently auditable control mechanisms
2016-09-23T15:08:36 <ewbjr> colinclark: the sample IOS client is able to connect to the server and enter a room, as well as toggle video/speakers/mic, but it doesn\'t have chat at the moment
2016-09-23T15:09:17 <colinclark> ok
2016-09-23T15:09:20 <colinclark> good news, ewbjr
2016-09-23T15:09:23 * amatas has quit
2016-09-23T15:09:44 <colinclark> Our vendor was causing quite a few problems for us this week in regards to WebRTC
2016-09-23T15:09:52 <colinclark> but I think I\'ve finally started to resolve the issues
2016-09-23T15:10:03 <colinclark> I was quite worried we\'d just have to switch gears and build an iOS client instead
2016-09-23T15:10:11 <colinclark> but I believe we should have WebRTC working on the system next week
2016-09-23T15:10:15 <ewbjr> oh yea? so we might still be able to move forward with the WebRTC?
2016-09-23T15:10:16 <ewbjr> amazing
2016-09-23T15:10:17 <colinclark> yes
2016-09-23T15:10:27 <colinclark> They claimed it was going to cost us a lot of money
2016-09-23T15:10:43 <colinclark> and I read a press release and pointed out that the gateway was apparently free
2016-09-23T15:10:52 <colinclark> and then they responded, "Oh yes, I guess it\'s free" :P
2016-09-23T15:11:10 <colinclark> So we\'re waiting on a virtual machine image of the gateway software
2016-09-23T15:11:13 <ewbjr> ah gotcha, I\'ll keep my fingers crossed, that\'s definitely my first choice :)
2016-09-23T15:11:14 <colinclark> and then gtirloni will install and set i tup
2016-09-23T15:11:29 <ewbjr> lol, good thing ya found that
2016-09-23T15:13:35 <colinclark> yes, it\'s quite a relief
2016-09-23T15:26:07 <colinclark> anyway, ewbjr, carry on with your UI development, and we\'ll get you the real server sometime next week
2016-09-23T15:26:27 <colinclark> Did you see the repository gtirloni set up for you, by the way, in the IDI github org?
2016-09-23T15:26:43 <gtirloni> colinclark: i\'ll be super admin too
2016-09-23T15:26:53 <colinclark> hahaha
2016-09-23T15:26:55 <colinclark> SUPER gtirloni
2016-09-23T15:27:29 <gtirloni> my childhood dream will finally come true :P
2016-09-23T15:27:32 <gtirloni> http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/lookout/images/d/de/SSJ.gif/revision/latest?cb=20160419083540
2016-09-23T15:28:27 <ewbjr> Sounds good, and I did and will commit the prototype I was working on, was just waiting to see if we were gonna pivot \xf0\x9f\x91\x8c\xf0\x9f\x8f\xbe
2016-09-23T15:28:36 <gtirloni> once they get us the OVA, it shouldn\'t take long to have something running. as long as the admin guide is correct :)

2016-09-23T18:05:41 <kavya> I need to establish a connection to  SUT(Virtual box vm Guest os) through eggplant fucntional.  for this,i Installed VNC server on guest OS and tried to connect from eggplant functional but coundn\'t able to connect to SUT  I disabled firewalls on both machines,changed vm network to bridged mode and few other options but nothing worked
2016-09-23T18:06:55 <kavya> But i can able to connect to guest os from vnc server from my host os,i think the problem is with eggplant

2016-09-23T18:08:10 <kavya> i am stuck here and it is stopping me from running script

2016-09-23T18:36:16 <colinclark> Hi kavya, I just saw your question
2016-09-23T18:36:21 <colinclark> I\'m not sure what SUT is
2016-09-23T18:36:41 <colinclark> maybe you could elaborate a bit more on what you\'re trying to do?
2016-09-23T18:38:13 <kavya> Hi Colin..
2016-09-23T18:38:21 <kavya> SUT - system under test
2016-09-23T18:39:03 <kavya> i want to evaluate eggplant functional tool with basic gpii login/logout script
2016-09-23T18:42:22 <kavya> This is the description:The first system is the machine running the eggPlant Functional application. This system can be a Mac, Windows, or Linux machine. This machine has everything needed to run the test, such as the scripts and associated images. The second system is the system under test, or SUT. The SUT is where the application to be tested is running. The SUT can be any system, including desktop machines, virtual machines, or m
2016-09-23T18:43:48 <kavya> Documentation:http://docs.testplant.com/ePF/eggplant-functional-documentation-home.htm
2016-09-23T18:48:12 <colinclark> Ok, so if I understand what you\'re saying, you\'ve got Eggplant running on your computer (on "the host"), and then you\'ve got a VirtualBox VM setup up running Windows with a copy of the GPII installed on it? Is that correct?
2016-09-23T18:48:33 <kavya> TO conect to SUT.Eggplat fucntional has two options: 1. install vnc on sut  2.connect through rdp
2016-09-23T18:48:45 <kavya> yes
2016-09-23T18:49:25 <colinclark> How did you create this VirtualBox VM? Is it something you hand-rolled, or are you using avtar\'s VM automation with vagrant?
2016-09-23T18:49:49 <kavya> 1 option: I have to install VNC server on guest os i;e virtual box vm
2016-09-23T18:50:10 <kavya> i am using avtar vagrant
2016-09-23T18:50:30 <colinclark> Ok, so you checked out the GPII windows code, and then ran "vagrant up"?
2016-09-23T18:50:34 <colinclark> And now you\'ve got a working VM, right?
2016-09-23T18:50:55 <kavya> thats right
2016-09-23T18:51:02 <avtar> hey colinclark, kavya
2016-09-23T18:51:16 <kavya> hi avtar
2016-09-23T18:51:29 <colinclark> Ok, so it sounds like the next step is to either use a VNC server or RDP in the box, as you say
2016-09-23T18:51:40 <kavya> yes
2016-09-23T18:51:42 <colinclark> kavya: Which VNC server did you try?
2016-09-23T18:51:46 <avtar> i\'m not familiar with eggplant but you should be able to use rdp with the idi box https://github.com/GPII/windows/blob/master/Vagrantfile#L19
2016-09-23T18:52:22 <colinclark> avtar: Are there any other issues to know about in regards to networking with the VM? Should VNC work equally well, assuming the VNC server is correctly configured?
2016-09-23T18:52:31 <colinclark> nice that we\'ve got RDP support rolled right in there
2016-09-23T18:52:41 <kavya> realvnc 5.3.2 https://www.realvnc.com/download/vnc/
2016-09-23T18:53:42 <colinclark> Ok, so you\'ve installed the RealVNC server and you\'ve configured it?
2016-09-23T18:53:56 <kavya> I can able to connect to VNC  on vm from vnc viewer from host os(my computer)
2016-09-23T18:54:02 <kavya> yes
