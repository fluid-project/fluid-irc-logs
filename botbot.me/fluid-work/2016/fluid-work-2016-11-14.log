2016-11-14T20:02:22 <avtar> Justin_o: hmm, i would think terminal seems safe on mac and linux
2016-11-14T20:02:27 <avtar> and command prompt on windows
2016-11-14T20:03:34 <Justin_o> avtar: but no single term for all places?
2016-11-14T20:04:41 * yzen is now known as yzen_
2016-11-14T20:07:15 <gtirloni> "terminal emulator" would clear all doubts on all platforms I guess
2016-11-14T20:07:32 <avtar> yeah, good call
2016-11-14T20:08:20 <simonjb> Justin_o: "command line"?
2016-11-14T20:08:57 <simonjb> or do you need actual terminal rather than interaction?
2016-11-14T20:15:13 <Justin_o> simonjb, avtar, gtirloni: just wondering in reference to our documentation related to this comment that jhung left https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/pull/102#discussion_r87854441
2016-11-14T20:16:24 <gtirloni> Justin_o, a good example -- http://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview
2016-11-14T20:16:48 <gtirloni> Justin_o, they use terminal (lowercase) and command line interchangeably
2016-11-14T20:17:23 <Justin_o> gtirloni: that\'s interesting, considering it\'s an MS product
2016-11-14T20:18:59 <Justin_o> gtirloni: although I think our docs are trying to also appeal to or work for a less developer centric crowd. That is, someone who isn\'t a full time developer but should be able to integrate UIO based on a quick tutorial. jhung is that correct?
2016-11-14T20:25:04 <jhung> Justin_o, gtirloni - yes. We\'ve been pointing people to that tutorial as a first resource, but we\'re finding that they\'re quickly getting lost and we often have to intervene very early (i.e. they only get as far as downloading the ZIP file). Ideally the docs should get them further along.

2016-11-14T20:25:29 * avtar joined the channel
2016-11-14T20:26:11 <simonjb> if the audience is really broad, we might want to offer wording that is platform specific. Something like: "on Mac or other Unix-like systems, open a terminal, and on Windows open a Command Prompt"
2016-11-14T20:26:14 <jhung> I intend to create revamp that tutorial very soon as I work through the next integration. I plan on making it in our Wiki first and then migrate the relevant changes to the official docs
2016-11-14T20:26:42 <avtar> +1 simonjb\'s suggestion
2016-11-14T20:26:47 <jhung> simonjb: yes exactly\xe2\x80\xa6 and some people aren\'t even aware that their computers have command prompts.
2016-11-14T20:27:15 <Justin_o> simonjb, avtar: if someone is using powershell on windows, is that considered a command prompt or a terminal?
2016-11-14T20:27:40 <simonjb> I think if someone is using PowerShell, they likely would know what the above means
2016-11-14T20:27:45 <avtar> Justin_o: command prompt seems to generally imply cmd.exe
2016-11-14T20:28:07 <simonjb> using powershell would be their choice
2016-11-14T20:28:11 <Justin_o> simonjb: yah, i wouldn\'t disagree with that, just wondering for accuracy.
2016-11-14T20:28:18 <gtirloni> "open the app with the black screen"
2016-11-14T20:28:23 <Justin_o> could we omit the OS and say, command prompt / terminal?
2016-11-14T20:28:27 <Justin_o> gtirloni: lol
2016-11-14T20:29:00 <avtar> gtirloni: https://agrmfp2014.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/matrix-computers.jpg
2016-11-14T20:29:34 <Justin_o> is there no terminal that looks like the matrix one yet?
2016-11-14T20:29:37 <simonjb> Justin_o: I think it depends on our audience
2016-11-14T20:30:58 <jhung> How about "command line terminal"?
2016-11-14T20:31:19 <gtirloni> Justin_o, avtar: I think there was a "matrix" truetype font.. I messed around with that 10 years ago to get some cool looking terminals
2016-11-14T20:31:57 * yzen_ is now known as yzen
2016-11-14T20:31:59 <simonjb> jhung: I think it really depends on the audience, I would prefer just "command line" in that case, "command line terminal" feels a little awkward to me
2016-11-14T20:32:13 <jhung> that works for me too simonjb.
2016-11-14T20:32:22 <Justin_o> jhung: simonjb: sounds good to me
2016-11-14T20:32:52 <Justin_o> gtirloni, avtar: should we have a gsoc project for a UI Options adjuster to turn your webpage into a matrix like terminal
2016-11-14T20:33:19 <avtar> gtirloni, Justin_o: https://www.google.ca/search?q=ocr-b+font
2016-11-14T20:33:23 <gtirloni> that\'s a guaranteed +1 from me :)
2016-11-14T20:34:24 <Justin_o> :)
2016-11-14T20:38:54 <gtirloni> avtar, OCRB looks great.. I found this http://thematrixreloaded.tripod.com/fonts.html
2016-11-14T20:46:44 <Justin_o> gtirloni: that site is funny "This is another computer font. I think it\'s cool." "This font has nothing to do with the movie, except that the name is Morpheus."
2016-11-14T20:46:45 <simonjb> TRIPOD!!!
2016-11-14T20:47:16 <simonjb> let me search for that in Alta Vista

2016-11-14T21:21:39 <Bosmon5> Do you think you could remerge it with master?
2016-11-14T21:21:50 <cindyli> yes, that\'s what i think, Bosmon5
2016-11-14T21:22:37 <cindyli> avtar is helping me to set up windows vagrant within gpii/windows repo right now. so if you see something silly, that\'s from him
2016-11-14T21:22:58 <cindyli> so, hopefully i can get windows tested soon, Bosmon5. finger crossing...
2016-11-14T21:23:42 <Bosmon5> cindyli - awesome
2016-11-14T21:23:59 <Bosmon5> Perhaps I can channel gloob and say..... "Isn\'t it just vagrant up?" : P

2016-11-14T14:07:51 <the-t-in-rtf> @alanharnum, looks like it's in 20 minutes.
2016-11-14T14:08:16 <the-t-in-rtf> however, I have had zero time to work on it, so it's probably best to bump it.
2016-11-14T14:08:35 <the-t-in-rtf> The good news is I'm very close to getting my main work ready for review, and while that's in progress I'll have more time to follow up on other things.
2016-11-14T14:08:52 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, I'll send a note for everyone else.

2016-11-14T16:02:51 <gtirloni> ewbjr: hi, do you have any instructions on how to build the webrtc client repo?
2016-11-14T16:05:10 * alanharnum joined the channel
2016-11-14T16:06:36 <ewbjr> gtirloni: it's actually setup now to work right off the github pages, but I need to make a updated commit to fix a display error. I'm just copying over a backup. do you have a secure host I could upload the webrtc sample to or should I throw it up on one of ours, it'll need to be added to the servers CORS list I believe
2016-11-14T16:07:24 <ewbjr> gtirloni: oops, hadn't sen your response email, I'll forward you a host soon
2016-11-14T16:07:25 <gtirloni> ewbjr: we can setup automate deployment for this on our servers (redeploy after each commit)
2016-11-14T16:07:33 <gtirloni> whatever is easier
2016-11-14T16:07:46 <gtirloni> it might take a day to get the automation up on our end
2016-11-14T16:10:59 <ewbjr> gtirloni: at the moment there's the webrtc client and then separately there's the API webrtc sample I've been trying to get to connect, would we do two different docker containers for now?
2016-11-14T16:12:49 <gtirloni> the client is what we plan to deploy moving forward? i think that'd be automated then, but other one probably not (unless we plan to evolve it)... would both be used in the future?
2016-11-14T16:14:36 <gtirloni> ewbjr: if it's fast to upload it somewhere and test.. we could try that first. and work on the automation in parallel
2016-11-14T16:15:16 <gtirloni> unfortunately we don't have ssh/ftp remote access to our servers, only through automate deployments
2016-11-14T16:15:27 <gtirloni> so it won't be easy to create some area where you can upload files to
2016-11-14T16:30:47 <colinclark> gtirloni, ewbjr: It sounds like we should invest in some automation now, even while we're still in the testing phase
2016-11-14T16:32:56 <gtirloni> agreed. i just need to know how to build it
2016-11-14T16:35:24 * the-t-in-rtf has quit
2016-11-14T16:38:45 <colinclark> ewbjr: Can you give gtirloni step-by-step instructions on how to build a) the sample code and b) your application so that he can create Dockerfiles and deploy them for you?

2016-11-14T16:45:41 <cindyli> Justin_o,jhung, one thing i noticed using Justin_o's uploader pull request https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/783 on IE11 is, when using keyboard to tab onto the browse button, the button will trap 2 tabs. i guess one is onto the text+button dom object and the other is onto the button itself. So visually the 2nd tab seems not moving as expected. is this acceptable?
2016-11-14T16:47:21 <ewbjr> gtirloni: there's an error in one of the files in that commit that's causing that display issue, i'll update to the most recent version shortly which will get rid of that
2016-11-14T16:48:08 <jhung> cindyli: I think for now it's okay. We should definitely document the issue in a jira so it can be fixed later. Justin_o what are your thoughts?
2016-11-14T16:48:40 <gtirloni> ewbjr: i got it to show something by spinning up a local web server with the code. i checked the console, and running it directly on the browser causes some CORS warning
2016-11-14T16:50:54 <Justin_o> cindyli: i'm leaning towards what jhung suggested.
2016-11-14T16:51:12 <Justin_o> cindyli: would you like me to file the JIRA for it, or have you already done that?
2016-11-14T16:52:04 <Justin_o> clown: thanks for the tip to use Narrator with MS Edge

2016-11-14T17:01:18 <clown> Justin_o:  your welcome.  I hope it works.
2016-11-14T17:03:51 <clown> Justin_o:  it might work because narrator and edge both use UIA
2016-11-14T17:04:01 <clown> but, nvda and jaws are likely relying on IA2 still.
2016-11-14T17:04:18 <clown> or, are in the process of moving to UIA.
2016-11-14T17:04:37 <Justin_o> clown: ah, i see.. that would make sense

2016-11-14T17:44:42 <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: Testing is once again completely open for the Infusion 2.0 release. I had to reset the Uploader tests and could use some help testing those specific tasks across browsers. Please feel free to pick up those and other testing tasks at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yFJotFr4_HJhNK-kwAxjE4gCozJYu48xIIjkA91gloU/edit?usp=sharing
