2016-09-22T17:24:30 <cindyli> my universal branch for the couchDB work is dependent on this pull request
2016-09-22T17:25:16 <cindyli> some tests fail with outdated model transformation

2016-09-22T14:20:29 <colinclark> I can\'t make 11 am EDT anymore due to a previous meeting that wasn\'t in my calendar
2016-09-22T14:20:36 <colinclark> But my afternoon is totally free
2016-09-22T14:21:45 <cindyli> i see, colinclark. is 1PM good for you, colinclark, and simonjb & Bosmon
2016-09-22T14:22:41 <colinclark> Bosmon as the windows meeting until 1:30 pm EDT, I think cindyli
2016-09-22T14:22:45 <colinclark> What about 2 pm EDT?
2016-09-22T14:23:04 <cindyli> sure. anytime in the afternoon is good for me :)
2016-09-22T14:27:52 <colinclark> I guess we\'ll need to wait to hear back from Bosmon
2016-09-22T14:29:47 <cindyli> that\'s true, and simonjb as well

2016-09-22T14:32:57 <colinclark> sorry, didn\'t mean to forget you, simonjb  :)

2016-09-22T14:43:21 <cindyli> hi kasparnet, congrats on ur canopy match maker pull request making into the master. I\'m resolving conflicts from merging the master into my branch, particularly the change on gpii config files with using new canopyMatchMaker configs
2016-09-22T14:43:37 <kasparnet> hi cindyli
2016-09-22T14:43:47 <cindyli> i noticed most flatMatchMaker config has been replaced by canopy but not this one: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/configs/gpii.config.trusted-flowmanager.production.json#L13
2016-09-22T14:43:54 <cindyli> is that intentional?
2016-09-22T14:45:09 <kasparnet> cindyli: no - that\'s a mistake
2016-09-22T14:45:18 <kasparnet> thanks for finding that
2016-09-22T14:45:24 <cindyli> ah, ok. so all flat should be replaced by canopy?
2016-09-22T14:46:11 <cindyli> i\'m not very sure when to use canopy, when to use flat
2016-09-22T14:48:05 <cindyli> kasparnet: ^
2016-09-22T14:48:09 <Bosmon> cindyli - here\'s a clue
2016-09-22T14:48:23 <Bosmon> The flat matchmaker is not a matchmaker :)
2016-09-22T14:48:42 <cindyli> hey, Bosmon, great to hear from u, are you available 2PM EDT today for auth server examples talk?
2016-09-22T14:48:58 <kasparnet> cindyli: hehe, indeed - always use the canopy matchmaker
2016-09-22T14:49:08 <Bosmon> colinclark - meetings after 2pm EDT generally won\'t be very good for me in future
2016-09-22T14:49:22 <cindyli> cool. great to know. thanks, kasparnet and Bosmon
2016-09-22T14:49:50 <cindyli> Bosmon: we can do it later today if there\'s a better time for you
2016-09-22T14:50:04 <Bosmon> cindyli - I mean any time after 2pm
2016-09-22T14:50:12 <Justin_o> Bosmon: while you\'re hear, just to let you know I\'ve updated the following PRs and they are ready for more review https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/752, https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/727, and https://github.com/fluid-project/fluid-publish/pull/5
2016-09-22T14:50:16 <cindyli> sure. is 3PM good for u?
2016-09-22T14:50:17 <Bosmon> My life circumstances have changed a bit, as you know : P
2016-09-22T14:50:23 <Bosmon> cindyli - no, those times are not good
2016-09-22T14:50:31 <cindyli> ok
2016-09-22T14:50:38 <cindyli> anytime after 2PM is NOT good
2016-09-22T14:50:41 <cindyli> now i get it
2016-09-22T14:51:00 <cindyli> thought 2 is not good, but after is ok, sorry ;)
2016-09-22T14:51:22 <colinclark> :)
2016-09-22T14:51:31 <colinclark> good to know, Bosmon
2016-09-22T14:51:37 <cindyli> Bosmon: would sometime tomorrow morning good? colinclark, simonjb
2016-09-22T14:51:54 <colinclark> 11 am tomorrow?
2016-09-22T14:52:24 <Bosmon> Yes 11am tomorrow is good
2016-09-22T14:52:28 <cindyli> anytime tomorrow is good for me
2016-09-22T14:52:37 <simonjb> 11am tomorrow is good for me too
2016-09-22T14:52:44 <Bosmon> Thanks Justin_o, I\'ll take a look
2016-09-22T14:52:45 <cindyli> cool YAY!! thanks guys
2016-09-22T14:54:08 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks :)
2016-09-22T14:54:33 <Justin_o> Bosmon: also, is this really needed for 2.0 https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5963
2016-09-22T14:56:40 <Bosmon> Not strongly
2016-09-22T14:56:52 <Bosmon> It would be nice to have our dependencies sorted out before the release
2016-09-22T14:57:26 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i\'m reading through the eslint page you linked to
2016-09-22T14:57:49 <Bosmon> It\'s a pretty small piece of work
2016-09-22T14:58:58 <Justin_o> Bosmon: maybe i\'ll take a look at it today
2016-09-22T15:01:24 <cindyli> Bosmon: you mentioned to use InMemoryDataStore.js as a documentation reference. Do you have an idea of how to integrate it into our documentation?
2016-09-22T15:06:09 <Bosmon> cindyli - we could just add doc comments to it :)
2016-09-22T15:06:20 <Bosmon> And then link to it from a .md file describing what it does
2016-09-22T15:07:40 <cindyli> i see. so we keep InMemoryDataStore.js in the repo, or perhaps move it to the documentation folder, Bosmon?
2016-09-22T15:08:33 <Bosmon> cindyli - well there\'s no point keeping it if it doesn\'t have functioning tests
2016-09-22T15:08:53 <Bosmon> And preferably the same tests that are passed by our other DataStore
2016-09-22T15:09:10 <Bosmon> It might be more trouble than it is worth
2016-09-22T15:09:27 <Bosmon> But the new DataStore has parts that are quite difficult to follow, even after some cleanup
2016-09-22T15:10:06 <cindyli> Bosmon: can you elaborate on "add doc comments to it"
2016-09-22T15:10:23 <Bosmon> cindyli - you know, those comments that we often write before methods
2016-09-22T15:10:36 <Bosmon> Featuring blocks such as @param structure {Object} A thing  .... etc
2016-09-22T15:10:40 <cindyli> i see
2016-09-22T15:14:04 <cindyli> Bosmon: another approach is to explain the logic in a .md document. of course it might be more straightforward for developers to look at inMemoryDataStore as a reference
2016-09-22T15:14:32 <Bosmon> cindyli - the main idea behind this serving as documentation is that the code is extremely clear
2016-09-22T15:14:49 <Bosmon> The impl consists of a bunch of 2 or 3-line methods
2016-09-22T15:15:15 <cindyli> i totally agree. but that also means in the future we willneed to maintain the logic within inMemoryDataStore if things change in the new data store
2016-09-22T15:15:40 <cindyli> "will need"
2016-09-22T15:23:39 <cindyli> Bosmon: what do you think we explain the logic of each API in a documentation rather than keeping inMemoryDataStore around, to reduce the future maintainance?

2016-09-22T16:00:41 <Bosmon> We could just archive InMemoryDataStore.js and you can refer to it in a gist from some comment in DbDataStore "for historical interest"
2016-09-22T16:01:05 <cindyli> sounds good. thanks, Bosmon
2016-09-22T16:01:29 <cindyli> thanks for ur comments on my security pull request too, Bosmon, will have a look soon
