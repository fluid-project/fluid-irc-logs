2016-11-15T17:09:48 <Justin_o> cindyli: i was looking at your comment https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/784#issuecomment-260674397
2016-11-15T17:11:05 <Justin_o> the funny thing is that i don\'t think we are actually even copying over that directory. It may be an issue with grunt plugin or stylus itself.
2016-11-15T17:11:17 <Justin_o> perhaps we could remove it using the clean task, not sure
2016-11-15T17:11:24 <cindyli> interesting
2016-11-15T17:15:41 <Justin_o> cindyli: this is the tasks that does the stylus generation https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/Gruntfile.js#L233-L244
2016-11-15T17:17:50 * kavya joined the channel
2016-11-15T17:18:43 <cindyli> Justin_o: so, it builds stylus files into css files. the stylus directory remains where it should be
2016-11-15T17:19:47 <Justin_o> cindyli: yes should be, not sure why it\'s writing out a stylus directory though, maybe it\'s needed for the relative dest, or maybe it\'s copying over the stylus directory first
2016-11-15T17:20:27 <cindyli> Justin_o: running the default build copied everything under "css" dir including the content in the subdir "stylus". but different running "buildDists"
2016-11-15T17:20:47 <Justin_o> cindyli: yes, they use a different configuration
2016-11-15T17:21:26 <Justin_o> the dist directory is intended to hold generated/processed files, in the case of the css it also includes all its dependencies
2016-11-15T17:22:38 <cindyli> "in the case of the css it also includes all its dependencies" - i hope you don\'t mean stylus files are considered as dependencies of css
2016-11-15T17:22:47 <Justin_o> no
2016-11-15T17:22:54 <Justin_o> i mean the images and fonts they use
2016-11-15T17:23:12 <cindyli> ok
2016-11-15T17:23:46 <cindyli> line 379 in ur pull request of Gruntfile.js has a step of "clean:stylus"
2016-11-15T17:24:43 <cindyli> at line 64, "clean:stylus" is not to clean up stylus files, it\'s to clean up css files
2016-11-15T17:24:46 * alanharnum has quit
2016-11-15T17:25:16 <Justin_o> cindyli: that\'s cleaning for stylus builds
2016-11-15T17:25:42 <Justin_o> it removes generated css files
2016-11-15T17:25:48 <cindyli> i see, before starting the stylus build
2016-11-15T17:26:38 <cindyli> do you think it\'s worth to add another after-build clean step to remove "stylus" dir, Justin_o?
2016-11-15T17:27:27 <Justin_o> cindyli: i can see if i can add another distribution clean step
2016-11-15T17:27:47 <cindyli> thanks, Justin_o

2016-11-15T17:35:16 <Bosmon5> Hi cindyli - wondering about your most recent commit to the GPII-1274 branch
2016-11-15T17:35:33 <Bosmon5> It appears to be to a file that doesn\'t exist in master
2016-11-15T17:35:34 <cindyli> hi Bosmon5 concerns?
2016-11-15T17:35:58 <cindyli> yes, this branch contains a new vagrant VM that starts GPII in the production mode
2016-11-15T17:36:16 <Bosmon5> cindyli - I see - how did this work end up in this branch?
2016-11-15T17:36:23 <Bosmon5> Is there a separate JIRA that covers it?
2016-11-15T17:37:01 <cindyli> used to be, Bosmon5, but since the VM needs to work with the new config files in this branch, the VM ended up in here
2016-11-15T17:37:38 <cindyli> we had a discussion in one arch meeting about having separate prefs server and flow manager in this VM
2016-11-15T17:37:46 <Bosmon5> Yes, I remember
2016-11-15T17:37:46 <cindyli> that change was made in this branch too
2016-11-15T17:37:54 <Bosmon5> But I didn\'t think this work was still live
2016-11-15T17:38:02 <Bosmon5> So there is no separate pull request for this work?
2016-11-15T17:38:07 <Bosmon5> Is this work being done with amatas?
2016-11-15T17:38:20 <cindyli> i think avtar was the one who worked on it
2016-11-15T17:39:07 <cindyli> digging on jira
2016-11-15T17:40:04 <cindyli> GPII-1821
2016-11-15T17:40:27 <cindyli> i merged avtar\'s this branch - https://github.com/avtar/universal/tree/GPII-1821 in august
2016-11-15T17:40:33 <Bosmon5> What a terrible JIRA!
2016-11-15T17:41:07 <cindyli> agree! it was me :(
2016-11-15T17:41:25 <cindyli> improving
2016-11-15T17:41:47 <Bosmon5> no worries :)
2016-11-15T17:41:56 <Bosmon5> So I think that the "examples" directory is a bad place for this material
2016-11-15T17:42:09 <Bosmon5> Since, I imagine, we are going to set up our CI so that it always runs?
2016-11-15T17:42:47 <cindyli> avtar: would you be able to answer ^
2016-11-15T17:43:20 <avtar> cindyli, Bosmon5: i imagine so
2016-11-15T17:43:29 * kasparne_ joined the channel
2016-11-15T17:44:13 <Bosmon5> My feeling is then that it should go somewhere in the top-level "provisioning" dir
2016-11-15T17:44:56 <Bosmon5> I know that this is currently a kind of junkyard built on the assumption that just one VM is built from one repository
2016-11-15T17:45:13 <Bosmon5> But this is no doubt the time that this assumption should change :)
2016-11-15T17:46:12 <Bosmon5> Oh, I see ... this currently has an entire "provisioning" dir inside it
2016-11-15T17:46:36 * kasparnet has quit
2016-11-15T17:46:48 <cindyli> probably we should have a separate root dir for all kinds of VMs
2016-11-15T17:46:48 <Bosmon5> Well, it looks like it will be quite disruptive to try to reorganise this, given we have our CI system set up already
2016-11-15T17:47:10 <Bosmon5> And all of our provisioning instructions, etc.
2016-11-15T17:47:32 <avtar> yeah we need to figure out an ideal approach for multi-environments in a monorepo style project
2016-11-15T17:47:42 <avtar> something i don\'t have an answer for yet :P
2016-11-15T17:47:46 <Bosmon5> Well, this doesn\'t even depend on monorepo
2016-11-15T17:48:02 <Bosmon5> We simply have a project which requires more than one Vagrant config
2016-11-15T17:48:25 <Bosmon5> OK, well, in the interim I suggest we just pick a fresh top-level directory to house such things
2016-11-15T17:48:26 <avtar> yes but that project hosts several different components such as the preferences server, flow manager
2016-11-15T17:48:28 <Bosmon5> "vagrants" or such
2016-11-15T17:48:50 <Bosmon5> And make a JIRA to move even our current "top-level" vagrant config into there in time
2016-11-15T17:49:03 <Bosmon5> Happy for suggestions for names :)
2016-11-15T17:49:13 <Bosmon5> But I think "examples" is a misleading area for this
2016-11-15T17:50:50 <cindyli> gpii-VMs
2016-11-15T17:50:58 <cindyli> VMs
2016-11-15T17:53:04 <Bosmon5> avtar - it does - but we will have this requirement "come what may" - for example our requirement to test against multiple versions of Windows, multiple user account styles, multiple bitnesses, multiple values of the UAC setting, etc : P
2016-11-15T17:53:45 <avtar> Bosmon5: for sure

2016-11-15T17:56:37 <Justin_o> cindyli: this is ready for more review https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/784
2016-11-15T17:56:38 <amatas> Bosmon5, the project I\'m working in order to simplify as much as possible the CI/QI testing is https://github.com/amatas/vagrant-vmenv/
2016-11-15T17:56:47 <amatas> avtar, :D yup

2016-11-15T17:57:40 <Bosmon5> amatas - looks cool, yes
2016-11-15T17:57:44 <Bosmon5> Who are you working on with this?
2016-11-15T17:57:46 <Bosmon5> we

2016-11-15T17:57:53 <Bosmon5> working with on this :)
2016-11-15T17:58:20 <Bosmon5> And - why is so much of the infrastructure written in Ruby? : P
2016-11-15T17:58:59 <amatas> Bosmon5 Vagrant is written using Ruby
2016-11-15T17:59:21 <amatas> that\'s why most of the code is in Ruby
2016-11-15T17:59:37 <Bosmon5> I see
2016-11-15T18:00:21 <amatas> in fact, the next iteration will be a Vagrant plugin that contains all this stuff, so we can get rid of the Vagrantfile and only use the .qi.yml as definition of the QI/CI testing

2016-11-15T18:04:51 <amatas> ups
2016-11-15T18:05:14 <amatas> also gtirloni and Avtar are testing
2016-11-15T18:05:52 <amatas> https://github.com/amatas/vagrant-vmenv/tree/master/samples here you can find some samples using our repositories
2016-11-15T18:07:24 <Bosmon5> amatas - what do you mean by "the loading of the npm module fails in some cases"?
2016-11-15T18:07:29 <amatas> for example the gpii-linux-production sample is the implementation of that request that you made some time ago, about having a couple of VMs, one server and one client, trying to recreate the production environment
2016-11-15T18:07:39 <Bosmon5> If our unit of distribution wasn\'t an npm module, how could we build up these definitions in a reusable way?
2016-11-15T18:08:48 <amatas> Bosmon5, the vagrant-vmenv module must be installed as a global module because the local node_modules directory can be pruned at testing time
2016-11-15T18:08:52 <cindyli> Bosmon5: i saw ur comment on my pull request regarding the location of the production VM. according to our discussion, i will move this vm and the vm at the universal root directory for universal testing into a new universal root dir called "VMs". does that sound good?
2016-11-15T18:09:15 <Bosmon5> amatas - what do you mean by "can be pruned at testing time"?
2016-11-15T18:09:34 <amatas> and I don\'t know why, but it seems that in some setups (like windows, or Fedora) nodejs is unable to locate the module in the global node_modules directory.
2016-11-15T18:10:03 <amatas> I mean that the content of that directory can be removed
2016-11-15T18:10:14 <Bosmon5> amatas - can be removed through what process?
2016-11-15T18:10:38 <Bosmon5> cindyli - I doubt you can move the vm at the universal root directory since you will break all our CI infrastructure
2016-11-15T18:10:43 <amatas> for example if your host is a windows vm, and the testing vm is a linux. One step to avoid failues is to clean the node_modules directory.
2016-11-15T18:10:47 <amatas> failures*
2016-11-15T18:10:57 <Bosmon5> cindyli - It\'s ok to just move your new VM
2016-11-15T18:11:44 <Bosmon5> amatas - ok - it sounds like we need to arrange a series of meetings on this topic
2016-11-15T18:11:51 <Bosmon5> We should bring it up at tomorrow\'s arch meeting
2016-11-15T18:11:53 <cindyli> Bosmon5: right, a good catch, so, will only move the production VM into a universal root dir "VMs"

2016-11-15T18:15:53 <Bosmon5> cindyli - I guess I\'d prefer there to be "vagrant" somewhere in the name, since i) these are not actual VM definitions, and ii) it\'s not clear we plan to support other orchestration schemes than vagrant
2016-11-15T18:16:03 <Bosmon5> cindyli - note that vagrant can also support Docker environments, which are not VMs
2016-11-15T18:16:32 <cindyli> Bosmon5: gpii-vagrant?
2016-11-15T18:16:40 <cindyli> vagrants?
2016-11-15T18:16:50 <cindyli> gpii-vagrants
2016-11-15T18:17:06 <Bosmon5> We can axe gpii- also, since our choice here will be common across all of our projects
2016-11-15T18:17:18 <Bosmon5> I\'d go for vagrant-configs, perhaps, to be explicit
2016-11-15T18:17:30 <cindyli> cool. thanks, Bosmon5

2016-11-15T14:26:43 <jhung> Justin_o: Is there a reason why the default grunt task for infusion doesn\'t also include the CSS files required for UIO?
2016-11-15T14:27:12 <Justin_o> it doesn\'t ?
2016-11-15T14:27:18 <jhung> Nope
2016-11-15T14:27:30 <Justin_o> it should, the default does a full build
2016-11-15T14:27:57 <jhung> Hmmm.. I\'m working from the FLUID-5977 branch. Let me switch to master and see Justin_o
2016-11-15T14:29:12 <Justin_o> jhung: let me know if that doesn\'t work, i think i might see a bug
2016-11-15T14:31:17 <jhung> Justin_o: Confirmed. The resulting infusion-2.0.0.zip file does not contain the CSS files. Just the stylus files.
2016-11-15T14:33:22 <Justin_o> jhung: do you get a dist directory for that?
2016-11-15T14:34:45 <jhung> yes Justin_o, there\'s a dist/assets/src directory which has the CSS files. But why aren\'t these included in the ZIP file?
2016-11-15T14:35:35 <Justin_o> jhung: okay it\'s a bug.. it should be in the zip in this case... could you file a blocker for this and i\'ll fix it today.. shouldn\'t take me long to make the fix.
2016-11-15T14:35:50 <Justin_o> also could you do a quick test today on the builds in general and see if there are any other obvious issues?
2016-11-15T14:37:11 <jhung> Justin_o: sure. Let me make a Jira. Not sure if any of this is "obvious". I only noticed it because I was going through the UIO Tutorial to make sure it was complete.
2016-11-15T14:37:55 <Justin_o> hmm, true
2016-11-15T14:44:27 <jhung> Justin_o: https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6071
2016-11-15T14:44:49 <Justin_o> jhung: thanks
2016-11-15T14:53:19 <Bosmon5> Hey there stegru - brilliant that you can reproduce the osk start failure
2016-11-15T14:53:27 <Bosmon5> I was just getting geared up to try to demonstate it again...
2016-11-15T14:53:32 <Bosmon5> Any idea what you did differently to make it appear?
2016-11-15T14:53:36 * yzen is now known as yzen_
2016-11-15T14:53:52 <stegru> yes, I think I re-enabled UAC
2016-11-15T14:54:09 <stegru> well, i know i did - i think that might be the thing
2016-11-15T14:54:21 <Justin_o> Bosmon5: we\'re going to try to talk about the Infusion-Docs styling JIRAs you filed, at today\'s design crit.
2016-11-15T14:54:44 <Bosmon5> stegru - ok, and this is realistic, right?
2016-11-15T14:54:52 <Bosmon5> We\'d expect ordinary users of the GPII to have this enabled?
2016-11-15T14:55:00 <Bosmon5> Justin_o - cool
2016-11-15T14:55:17 <Justin_o> Bosmon5:  you\'re welcome to join, it starts in about 5 minutes
2016-11-15T14:55:28 <stegru> well, windows out of the box does not have it enabled.
2016-11-15T14:55:35 <stegru> sorry, HAS it enabled

2016-11-15T14:57:38 <Justin_o> cindyli: could you please take a look at this PR https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/784
2016-11-15T14:57:48 <cindyli> sure, Justin_o
2016-11-15T14:57:56 <Justin_o> jhung: ^ that should address the issue you found with the stylus builds
2016-11-15T14:57:57 <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks
2016-11-15T14:58:20 <cindyli> np
2016-11-15T14:58:47 <jhung> ok thanks Justin_o. I\'ll give it a try after Design Crit.
2016-11-15T14:58:48 * yzen_ has quit
2016-11-15T14:59:10 <stegru> Bosmon5: so, the current problem is: when UAC is OFF, and when running as a non-admin user, it fails
2016-11-15T14:59:28 * alanharnum joined the channel
2016-11-15T14:59:40 <jhung> fluid-everyone: The design crit is starting in 2 minutes. We\'re talking about some docs related issues today: Icons, workflow, and docs improvements.
2016-11-15T15:06:15 <jhung> fluid-everyone: https://jhung.github.io/docs-template/
2016-11-15T15:08:19 <Bosmon5> stegru - oh, I see
2016-11-15T15:08:30 <Bosmon5> Well that merely gives us 48 configurations to test via our CI :)
2016-11-15T15:08:54 <stegru> hah yeh I was just thinking that adds another configuration
2016-11-15T15:09:19 * avtar joined the channel
2016-11-15T15:09:45 <stegru> but who\'d have thought UAC would have any effect on a normal user
2016-11-15T15:10:35 <Bosmon5> I wonder why it\'s turned off
2016-11-15T15:10:41 <Bosmon5> I actually never saw this dialog before
2016-11-15T15:10:48 <Bosmon5> Perhaps this is how our vagrant box is configured by default
2016-11-15T15:11:58 <stegru> it is. I turned it back on, to make the test environment similar to a normal user

2016-11-15T15:13:59 * michelled has quit
2016-11-15T15:14:07 <stegru> in some places I think it could be possible that UAC is off (perhaps they have old software that requires it). But, in that case the users would probably be an admin user anyway.

2016-11-15T15:18:19 <amatas> Bosmon5, stegru our Vagrant VMs are based on this upstream repository https://github.com/joefitzgerald/packer-windows/blob/0ae9e8a721a1b3a7ab0962118c7e93ae3f9dba86/answer_files/10/Autounattend.xml#L82-L84
2016-11-15T15:18:38 <amatas> so yes, UAC is disabled by default in the Vagrant VMs
2016-11-15T15:18:50 <Bosmon5> amatas - ok - so it would be pretty easy to have UAC turned on by default?
2016-11-15T15:19:23 <Bosmon5> And just to double-confirm, this is how a standard user\'s copy of Windows ships out of the box, right?
2016-11-15T15:19:37 <amatas> it\'s easy, but we have to find which final step is the ideal for that, because we have to install a lot of stuff with admin permissions.
2016-11-15T15:20:05 <Bosmon5> Ah I see
2016-11-15T15:20:14 <Bosmon5> This is for ease of automated installation
2016-11-15T15:20:49 <Bosmon5> stegru - in any case, do you think it\'s worth you spending a few cycles to see if there\'s an easy fix to "starting osk with UAC off"?
2016-11-15T15:21:20 <amatas> exactly, we have to run all this stuff with admin permissions: https://github.com/idi-ops/packer-windows/tree/master/scripts and I must be unattended
2016-11-15T15:21:42 <stegru> yeh that\'s what i\'m doing, Bosmon5 - I\'m just going to see if it\'s "obvious", if not I\'ll defer it to another jira
2016-11-15T15:21:44 <amatas> It* must be unattended
2016-11-15T15:21:51 <Bosmon5> stegru - brilliant, thanks!
2016-11-15T15:21:59 <stegru> re-enabling it will require a reboot
