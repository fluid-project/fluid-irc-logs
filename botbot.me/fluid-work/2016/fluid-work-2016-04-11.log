2016-04-11T14:19:54 <Bosmon> fluid-everyone: grunt 1.0 released last week
2016-04-11T14:19:59 <Bosmon> We should consider a global move
2016-04-11T14:20:36 <Bosmon> https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/blob/master/CHANGELOG
2016-04-11T14:27:57 <simonjb> hi colinclark, how\'s it going?
2016-04-11T14:32:02 <colinclark> hi simonjb
2016-04-11T14:32:03 <colinclark> it\'s going okay
2016-04-11T14:32:04 <colinclark> i\'m still sans piano
2016-04-11T14:32:10 <colinclark> so i guess it\'s a plane project
2016-04-11T14:33:09 <colinclark> i\'ll be in the office after the security meeting today
2016-04-11T14:33:20 <simonjb> I could also work on it today -- or the joystick integration
2016-04-11T14:36:08 <simonjb> would there be something easy to hook up a joystick control to that you think would work well with what we currently have?
2016-04-11T14:36:31 <simonjb> one easy initial option would be to also control tremolo with it
2016-04-11T14:38:18 <simonjb> we talked about maybe vibrato -- would that be doable with our current synth?

2016-04-11T14:46:53 * colinclark_ joined the channel
2016-04-11T14:47:35 <colinclark_> simonjb: it should be doable
2016-04-11T14:48:21 <colinclark_> vibrato makes sense, just as something different
2016-04-11T14:48:51 <colinclark_> i\'d say you should work on the joystick, just because I\'m not sure I could do it
2016-04-11T14:48:56 <colinclark_> whereas the piano keyboard, I can do
2016-04-11T14:50:29 <simonjb> colinclark_: ok, cool, I would mul the speed with a sinOsc?
2016-04-11T14:50:34 <colinclark_> yup
2016-04-11T14:50:43 <colinclark_> or whatever oscillator you like
2016-04-11T14:50:46 <colinclark_> triangles are nice too :)
2016-04-11T14:50:55 <simonjb> sure
2016-04-11T14:51:32 <colinclark_> or you could map the vibrato directly to the analog stick
2016-04-11T14:51:33 <simonjb> thanks colinclark_ I\'ll work on the joystick vibrato
2016-04-11T14:51:54 <colinclark_> if that makes sense?
2016-04-11T14:51:54 <simonjb> colinclark_: like a pitch bend?
2016-04-11T14:51:58 <colinclark_> yeah
2016-04-11T14:52:05 <simonjb> yeah, I was thinking of that also
2016-04-11T14:52:14 <colinclark_> so that if you moved it fast back and forth, it would be vibrato
2016-04-11T14:52:18 <simonjb> right
2016-04-11T14:52:25 <colinclark_> and slow it would be more of a portamento
2016-04-11T14:52:58 <simonjb> so rather controlling an oscillator, it would control a multiplication factor on the speed?
2016-04-11T14:55:22 <colinclark_> yes
2016-04-11T14:57:01 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2016-04-11T14:59:29 <colinclark_> simonjb: Wishfully thinking...
2016-04-11T15:00:50 <colinclark_> If I were to want to highlight keys on the piano when notes are played on the zone controller
2016-04-11T15:02:47 <cindyli> Bosmon, colinclark_: APCP security meeting
2016-04-11T15:02:53 <colinclark_> yup
2016-04-11T15:03:27 <simonjb> colinclark_: that will be a little more work because I think we\'ll need to websocket connections
2016-04-11T15:03:37 <Bosmon> cindyli - coming
2016-04-11T15:03:51 <cindyli> thanks, guys
2016-04-11T15:04:03 <simonjb> colinclark_: one sending and one receiving -- otherwise we\'ll get the feedback I think if we do bidirectional single connection
2016-04-11T15:04:43 <simonjb> colinclark_: but otherwise, we could send the midi notes to the piano, for sure
2016-04-11T15:05:26 <simonjb> colinclark_: sorry "to websocket connections" should have been "2 websocket connections"
2016-04-11T15:05:45 <jhung> cindyli, simonjb, sepidehshahi, danayo: fyi floe planning
2016-04-11T15:06:00 <jhung> gtirloni too
2016-04-11T15:06:05 <simonjb> jhung: cindyli and I are in an APCP meeting
2016-04-11T15:06:12 <jhung> ok
2016-04-11T15:06:19 <simonjb> will be an hour long
2016-04-11T15:08:12 * wale has quit
2016-04-11T15:08:23 <simonjb> actually colinclark_ I think we could do it with a single connection, if we keep the models separate

2016-04-11T16:22:38 <gloob> :-)
2016-04-11T16:23:05 <colinclark> it\'s a nice city
2016-04-11T16:23:11 <colinclark> Sadly I won\'t be there long enough to really experience it
2016-04-11T16:25:00 <jhernandez> you won\'t miss a lot
