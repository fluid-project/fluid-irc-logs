2016-11-08T18:19:02 <Bosmon5> Hi cindyli - I\'ve left some feedback on the giant *ouch* pull
2016-11-08T18:19:19 <cindyli> thanks, Bosmon5. having a look now
2016-11-08T18:19:31 <Bosmon5> When I say "I have a fear that this step will fail" I really mean "I am practically certain that this will fail" : P
2016-11-08T18:20:08 <Bosmon5> Also as we found with alanharnum, there are extremely significant problems with the approach in general of "postinstall step invoking grunt task"
2016-11-08T18:20:35 <alanharnum> yes
2016-11-08T18:20:46 <Bosmon5> alanharnum - do we have our notes from the meeting we held about that?
2016-11-08T18:21:02 <Bosmon5> I keep meaning to post them but I imagine they are still just in a piratepad somewhere
2016-11-08T18:21:11 <alanharnum> forgive me for paraphrasing Dijkstra, but I\'d go so far as to say "postinstal considered harmful" at this point.
2016-11-08T18:21:24 <Bosmon5> I\'d go as far as "npm considered harmful"
2016-11-08T18:21:36 <alanharnum> perhaps "package management considered harmful" :)
2016-11-08T18:21:51 <Bosmon5> "build tools considered harmful" :)
2016-11-08T18:21:53 <alanharnum> maybe "computers considered harmful" :)
2016-11-08T18:21:54 <Bosmon5> Any advance on that?
2016-11-08T18:21:58 <Bosmon5> Ah, you trumped me already
2016-11-08T18:22:06 <Bosmon5> I think we have to stop one step short of that
2016-11-08T18:22:26 <alanharnum> Bosmon5: I\'m uncertain which meeting you\'re referring to. entirely possible there\'s notes from it sitting around.
2016-11-08T18:22:28 <Bosmon5> I think we plan to currently top out at "programming language code considered harmful"
2016-11-08T18:23:45 <alanharnum> what I\'d say is my heuristic is that any postinstall step that would cause an installation to fail if a package is installed as a dependency should be reconsidered
2016-11-08T18:23:52 <alanharnum> this is unfortunately virtually all of them
2016-11-08T18:24:31 <Bosmon5> alanharnum - I think some of us had a meeting about my horrifying discoveries in https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLOE-484
2016-11-08T18:24:47 <Bosmon5> And then we wrote some stuff in a gpii pad?
2016-11-08T18:27:24 <Bosmon5> I\'m away from that computer but perhaps you can find it in your browser history
2016-11-08T18:30:31 <alanharnum> Bosmon5: I don\'t have anything in pad.gpii.net in my history that looks like that, unfortunately
2016-11-08T18:30:49 <Bosmon5> Shame

2016-11-08T19:28:44 <cindyli> Bosmon5: in your pull request https://github.com/fluid-project/chartAuthoring/pull/16 for resolving FLOE-484, those dev dependencies were moved into dependencies block. I cannot use the same solution because browserified files generated by the postinstall in my pull are for browser tests, which only happen in the context of development.
2016-11-08T19:28:55 <cindyli> alan and I talked on other possible solutions
2016-11-08T19:29:36 <cindyli> 1. get rid of postinstall, instead having that step as a separate step after running "npm install" for setting up dev env.
2016-11-08T19:30:01 * the-t-in-rtf joined the channel
2016-11-08T19:30:47 <cindyli> 2. write a .js to detect the existence of those dev dependency packages. if packages are in place, run browserify commands, if not, exit quitely
2016-11-08T19:30:59 <cindyli> Bosmon5: your thoughts?
2016-11-08T19:32:41 <Bosmon5> cindyli - very interesting, yes
2016-11-08T19:33:04 <Bosmon5> I guess I incline towards 2
2016-11-08T19:33:15 <Bosmon5> This could be done fairly straightforwardly using our https://www.npmjs.com/package/fluid-resolve package
2016-11-08T19:33:51 <Bosmon5> It\'s a bit silly that npm has such hopeless support for its lifecycles
2016-11-08T19:34:33 <cindyli> ya, it would be very helpful to have a dev-postinstall
2016-11-08T19:35:13 <Bosmon5> It would also be very helpful to have a simple way of testing "is this module in a development configuration"
2016-11-08T19:35:25 * clown has quit
2016-11-08T19:35:44 <Bosmon5> cindyli - well, I think there are actually problems with 2.
2016-11-08T19:36:01 <Bosmon5> The most severe problem isn\'t that the dev dependencies may not be installed - it is with grunt itself
2016-11-08T19:36:16 <Bosmon5> It may well be that as a result of the npm 3 module layout, that we can easily resolve all the dev dependencies anyway
2016-11-08T19:36:23 <Bosmon5> But, all the same, grunt will explode
2016-11-08T19:36:23 <cindyli> oh, i see, i probably can get rid of grunt by using node rimraf
2016-11-08T19:36:37 <Bosmon5> Because it was written by an idiot who doesn\'t understand the node module loading algorithm
2016-11-08T19:36:37 <Bosmon5> !
2016-11-08T19:36:41 <Bosmon5> Why would you get rid of grunt
2016-11-08T19:36:49 <Bosmon5> The user presumably wants it, if it was there :)
2016-11-08T19:36:59 <Bosmon5> The problem is, even if it is there, it will fail to run
2016-11-08T19:37:08 <cindyli> Bosmon5: i mean to get rid of the grunt step being used in my postinstall step
2016-11-08T19:37:27 <cindyli> cannot get rid of the entire grunt from the universal repo ;)
2016-11-08T19:37:36 <Bosmon5> cindyli - ok - what did you mean by "using node rimraf"
2016-11-08T19:37:38 <Bosmon5> What would you delete
2016-11-08T19:38:22 <cindyli> the step checks the existence of a folder called "browserify", if it exists, remove it to start a fresh browserifying
2016-11-08T19:38:58 <Bosmon5> Ah I understand now
2016-11-08T19:39:02 <cindyli> a fresh browserifying includs the creation of "browserify" folder and actually file browserifying
2016-11-08T19:39:04 <Bosmon5> Get rid of the USE of grunt by using node rimraf :)
2016-11-08T19:39:13 <cindyli> yes, thanks
2016-11-08T19:39:25 <Bosmon5> Yes
2016-11-08T19:39:31 <Bosmon5> Anything that removes our reliance on grunt is a plus
2016-11-08T19:40:29 <cindyli> Bosmon5: which directory do you think this new .js file should sit in the universal repo
2016-11-08T19:40:30 <Bosmon5> Yes, it seems that postinstall could even break at top level - since depending on the npm options, devDependencies may not be installed there either
2016-11-08T19:40:37 <Bosmon5> https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/5554
2016-11-08T19:40:37 <cindyli> does it make sense to have it in the universal root dir
2016-11-08T19:41:02 * clown joined the channel
2016-11-08T19:41:26 <Bosmon5> cindyli - perhaps a dir named "scripts"?
2016-11-08T19:41:45 <Bosmon5> We can take suggestions from anyone else who is here?
2016-11-08T19:41:52 <cindyli> ok, i guess probably our future data loaders can go in there too - https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-1987
2016-11-08T19:41:59 * clown is now known as clown-mtg
2016-11-08T19:42:06 <Bosmon5> cindyli - yes, good
2016-11-08T19:42:45 <Bosmon5> We should try to keep the root fairly uncluttered
2016-11-08T19:43:25 <Bosmon5> So ok - +1 to write a plain .js script with use of fluid-resolve to detect if dev dependencies are installed, and then conditionally execute browserify/rimraf etc.
2016-11-08T19:44:06 * clown-mtg is now known as clown_mtg
2016-11-08T19:44:27 <cindyli> sounds great. thanks, Bosmon5
2016-11-08T19:44:51 <Bosmon5> Awesome - good luck, cindyli :)

2016-11-08T14:21:36 <cindyli> Bosmon, Bosmon7, with gtirloni\'s pull request for GPII-2060 (https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/484) making into the master, my ouchdb branch (https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/464) can be built with vagrant across reboots.
2016-11-08T14:21:52 <cindyli> aother pending issue with this branch is running node tests throws 409 but I think we can address it with a separate JIRA.
2016-11-08T14:24:43 <cindyli> Bosmon, Bosmon7, so, the ouchdb pull is ready for more reviews

2016-11-08T14:33:00 <Bosmon7> cindyli - but the node tests pass, though they throw 409 errors?
2016-11-08T14:33:23 <cindyli> Bosmon7: yes, they all pass with 409
2016-11-08T14:34:04 <cindyli> all database operations are still correct even 409 conflict warnings are thrown

2016-11-08T15:54:30 <kavya> stegru: Hi
2016-11-08T15:54:40 <stegru> hello!
2016-11-08T15:54:45 <kavya> I am looking into this JIRA https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2073
2016-11-08T15:55:55 <kavya> This issue is now fixed right?
2016-11-08T15:56:00 <stegru> ah
2016-11-08T15:56:12 <stegru> yes, it\'s fixed - but it needs to be merged
2016-11-08T15:56:22 <stegru> so no, it\'s not ready for you to test yet
2016-11-08T15:57:55 <kavya> ok..can you please update the status on JIRA with the pull request and its status
2016-11-08T15:59:14 <stegru> i don\'t know what you mean - the status already says there\'s a pull request
2016-11-08T15:59:59 <stegru> the next status is "pull request merged", but I can\'t do that yet because it\'s not been merged
2016-11-08T16:00:04 <michelled> kavya: if you are logged into JIRA you will see links to the pull requests on the right side
2016-11-08T16:02:01 <kavya> Yes..the status says where the JIRA issue is right now
2016-11-08T16:03:23 <kavya> so I am tracking the progress of each JIRA bug i created and will follow up weekly on its status
2016-11-08T16:03:35 <kavya> the status am asking here is to comment on JIRA
2016-11-08T16:05:11 <kavya> if the JIRA is in pull request,I should have update on who is reviewing it
2016-11-08T16:05:15 <stegru> you want me to add a comment to it to say the status?
2016-11-08T16:05:36 <michelled> it might be better to put the reviewer directly on the pull request?
2016-11-08T16:05:45 <michelled> in fact, can\'t we assign pull requests?
2016-11-08T16:06:34 <stegru> you mean, add someone to the conversation in github?
2016-11-08T16:09:03 <michelled> stegru: no, I think we can actually assign pull requests to people in github - kasparnet isn\'t that how we denote who is reviewing a pull request?
2016-11-08T16:09:21 <michelled> it\'s how we do it for infusion
2016-11-08T16:09:21 <Justin_o> gtirloni: cindyli1 merged in a PR for Infusion this morning, but it doesn\'t look like the build was triggerd
2016-11-08T16:09:41 * cindyli1 is now known as cindyli
2016-11-08T16:09:49 <kasparnet> michelled, stegru: yeah, that\'s what we (attempt to) do in GPII as well
2016-11-08T16:11:36 <michelled> kavya: will that address your need for information? or is there something else that we should do?
2016-11-08T16:12:06 <kavya> ok..It says unable to open pull req info when i try to open from JIRA. i need to contact admin
2016-11-08T16:12:06 <gtirloni> Justin_o: seems to have triggered yesterday - https://ci.fluidproject.org/job/fluid-infusion/43/
2016-11-08T16:12:24 <gtirloni> Justin_o: or was it another change?
2016-11-08T16:12:47 <gtirloni> ah, fluid-6038, checking.
2016-11-08T16:12:59 <Justin_o> gtirloni: yes, that one
2016-11-08T16:13:34 <michelled> kavya: are you logged into JIRA?
2016-11-08T16:14:46 <kavya> michelle: Yes, I logged in JIRA
2016-11-08T16:15:09 <michelled> kasparnet: can you check kavya\'s JIRA perms? she can\'t see the pull request into on a JIRA
2016-11-08T16:16:04 <gtirloni> jessm: looks like job #44 got created for that but it failed to run. i\'ll restart jenkins and trigger it manually again.
2016-11-08T16:16:11 <gtirloni> sorry, meant Justin_o
2016-11-08T16:16:24 <Justin_o> gtirloni: thanks
2016-11-08T16:16:40 <michelled> stegru: is Bosmon the reviewer for that work?
2016-11-08T16:16:48 <stegru> yeh
2016-11-08T16:18:13 <michelled> kasparnet: I don\'t have the correct perms in github to do assignments. Can you assign these to Bosmon?  https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/98  https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/479
2016-11-08T16:18:21 <kavya> I can see the pull requests
2016-11-08T16:18:36 <michelled> kavya: what is it that you can\'t see?
2016-11-08T16:18:41 <gtirloni> Justin_o: job #45 is running now (https://ci.fluidproject.org/job/fluid-infusion/45/). curiously, #44 is missing from the interface.. the logs had a bunch of errors but nothing conclusive
2016-11-08T16:18:59 <kasparnet> just checked your perms kavya and you\'re "jira-developer", which should give you most privs
2016-11-08T16:19:23 <kasparnet> michelled: sure
2016-11-08T16:19:31 <Justin_o> gtirloni: thanks for looking and starting up a new build. I wonder what happened? Is there any way to get alerts for jobs that start but don\'t finish?
2016-11-08T16:19:42 <gtirloni> Justin_o: looks like today\'s job was aborted, no details though -- https://ci.fluidproject.org/job/create-infusion-vm/43/console
2016-11-08T16:19:52 <gtirloni> Justin_o: aborted jobs don\'t generate alerts
2016-11-08T16:20:14 <kavya> Yes Kasper, Michelle i can see the pull requests now.
2016-11-08T16:20:38 <Justin_o> gtirloni: that link says it\'s for #43
2016-11-08T16:20:42 <Justin_o> shouldn\'t it be for #44
2016-11-08T16:20:49 <gtirloni> Justin_o: I created a JIRA for that, but we\'ll need someone proficient in Java to fix that in Jenkins (
2016-11-08T16:20:50 <kasparnet> michelled: assigned to bosmon now
2016-11-08T16:21:03 <michelled> thx kasparnet!
2016-11-08T16:21:19 <gtirloni> Justin_o: the main job is https://ci.fluidproject.org/job/fluid-infusion/ .. that other one #43 is a sub-job, they don\'t always follow the same number
2016-11-08T16:21:49 <michelled> kavya: so, do you now have the information you need? or is there something else we need to communicate? I just want to make sure we have a clear communication strategy that works for everyone
2016-11-08T16:22:32 <Justin_o> gtirloni: ah okay
2016-11-08T16:22:38 <kavya> Thanks Michelle,Kasparnet
2016-11-08T16:22:54 <kavya> Yes,I do have info i need
2016-11-08T16:23:01 <gtirloni> Justin_o: previous discussion about aborted builds - https://botbot.me/freenode/fluid-work/msg/73896700/  -- i\'ll open a JIRA just in case and check if someone has improved in the error reporting, but I\'m skeptical.
