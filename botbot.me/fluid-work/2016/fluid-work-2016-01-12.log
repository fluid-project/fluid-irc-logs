2016-01-12T20:00:10 <Justin_o> zamcnema: sorry, in a meeting at the moment.. will look at this shortly

2016-01-12T20:32:53 <Justin_o> zamcnema: so your sort of on the right track, but recall that you don't want to create and modify a new instance of the preview but change the configuration for the one that is used as a subcomponent of the prefsEditor created in this call
2016-01-12T20:32:53 <Justin_o> https://github.com/zamcnema/first-discovery-previewpane/blob/master/node_modules/gpii-first-discovery/demos/prefsServerIntegration/index.html#L195

2016-01-12T20:37:09 <zamcnema> Justin_o: okay, so the initWithPreview that returns fluid.prefs.create is trying to recreate it.
2016-01-12T20:40:52 <Justin_o> zamcnema: yes
2016-01-12T20:40:58 <Justin_o> oh and just an aside, you shouldn't need this https://github.com/zamcnema/first-discovery-previewpane/blob/master/node_modules/gpii-first-discovery/demos/prefsServerIntegration/index.html#L37
2016-01-12T20:41:11 <Justin_o> infusion comes with jQuery so you should have access to jQuery already
2016-01-12T20:42:53 <Justin_o> zamcnema: what you probably want to do instead is to either modify this function https://github.com/zamcnema/first-discovery-previewpane/blob/master/node_modules/gpii-first-discovery/demos/js/demos.js#L18-L38
2016-01-12T20:43:09 <Justin_o> or call a different function here https://github.com/zamcnema/first-discovery-previewpane/blob/master/node_modules/gpii-first-discovery/demos/prefsServerIntegration/index.html#L195

2016-01-12T20:53:18 <Justin_o> zamcnema: were you able to get it passed in?
2016-01-12T20:53:25 <Justin_o> the templateUrl
2016-01-12T20:56:06 <zamcnema> Justin_o: I'm trying to pass it in after the store in the firstDiscovery.init function and add a path to the parameters of the function. I was trying this earlier, but I didn't have much luck
2016-01-12T20:58:18 <Justin_o> zamcnema: that should work, let me know if you run into an issue with that
2016-01-12T21:05:53 * jhung is now known as jhung_meeting
2016-01-12T21:07:49 <zamcnema> Justin_o: I've tried it a few different ways, Its still in that fluid.prefs.create() function right. so wouldn't this still just be doing the same thing?

2016-01-12T21:35:32 <Justin_o> zamcnema: unfortunately i have to leave for the day, but i'll be back tomorrow morning. We can chat again then, but feel free to send me something if you find yourself stuck.
2016-01-12T21:36:12 <zamcnema> Justin_o: okay, I'll catch up with you then.
2016-01-12T21:36:21 <zamcnema> Justin_o: thanks again for the help.

2016-01-12T16:09:45 <zamcnema> Justin_o: Hey Justin, I need some advice about how to proceed with the fdt. I changed it so that the preview is a subcomponent of the firstdiscovery prefs editor. When I try to instantiate the preview outside of the section that uses the gpiic-fd-prefsEditor class i don\'t get a preview, and if I use the class in a different spot it destroys most of the formatting. is there a middle ground here, or will I just have to do some k
2016-01-12T16:10:05 <zamcnema> Justin_o: to get the preview where I need it while keeping it in that section tab?
2016-01-12T16:12:24 <Justin_o> zamcnema: what do you mean by "i don\'t get a preview"?
2016-01-12T16:12:43 <Justin_o> does the iframe show up but with a 404 error or something?
2016-01-12T16:13:35 <zamcnema> Justin_o: I\'ll get an error saying that the markup doesn\'t exist
2016-01-12T16:14:01 <zamcnema> Justin_o: because its out of the the scope of the preferences editor.
2016-01-12T16:14:36 <Justin_o> zamcnema: right because the selector are scoped to the components container.
2016-01-12T16:14:41 <Justin_o> zamcnema: exactly
2016-01-12T16:15:09 <zamcnema> Justin_o: I tried using the class twice in the page, but it threw me an error for that too
2016-01-12T16:15:23 <zamcnema> Justin_o: was worth a shot :D
2016-01-12T16:15:36 <Justin_o> zamcnema: right so as you say you have a couple of options 1) move the parents container so that the scoping covers everything or 2) modify the styling
2016-01-12T16:16:04 <Justin_o> zamcnema: yeah you\'ll get an error for that, but yes, worth a try
2016-01-12T16:17:40 <Justin_o> zamcnema: so the preview will have to go into https://github.com/zamcnema/first-discovery-previewpane/blob/master/node_modules/gpii-first-discovery/demos/index.html#L106
2016-01-12T16:18:19 <Justin_o> zamcnema: i guess you could try using a container that is sourced from the prefsEditorLoader instead
2016-01-12T16:19:27 <Justin_o> zamcnema: so leave this https://github.com/zamcnema/first-discovery-previewpane/blob/master/node_modules/gpii-first-discovery/src/js/firstDiscoveryEditor.js#L164
2016-01-12T16:19:29 <Justin_o> where it is
2016-01-12T16:19:56 <zamcnema> Justin_o: okay, maybe theres something to this. So the panels are tied to that prefsEditor tag
2016-01-12T16:20:20 <Justin_o> and then when specifying the previews container you\'d use "{firstDiscoveryEditor}.dom.previewFrame"
2016-01-12T16:20:25 <Justin_o> that might work
2016-01-12T16:21:19 <zamcnema> Justin_o: right now I\'m using
2016-01-12T16:21:23 <zamcnema> prefsEditor: {                 container: "{that}.dom.prefsEditor",                 options: {                 \tcomponents: {                         preview: {                         \ttype: "fluid.prefs.preview",                         \tcontainer: "{that}.dom.previewFrame",                         \tcreateOnEvent: "onReady",                         \toptions: {                         \t\tlisteners: {
2016-01-12T16:21:29 <zamcnema> that didn\'t work
2016-01-12T16:21:46 <zamcnema> sry
2016-01-12T16:21:50 <zamcnema> Justin_o: container: "{that}.dom.previewFrame",
2016-01-12T16:22:37 <Justin_o> zamcnema: so that won\'t work unless the previewFrame selector is defined in the prefsEditor component and the markup is located within the prefsEditor\'s markup
2016-01-12T16:22:57 <Justin_o> zamcnema: so i think you could try to source the container like
2016-01-12T16:23:00 <Justin_o> container: "{firstDiscoveryEditor}.dom.previewFrame"
2016-01-12T16:23:19 <Justin_o> if you leave the previewFrame selector and markup where you had them before
2016-01-12T16:23:46 <Justin_o> it\'s a bit strange in terms of how we usually scope things but i think it might work
2016-01-12T16:24:22 <zamcnema> okay I\'ll give it a show
2016-01-12T16:24:25 <zamcnema> shot*
2016-01-12T16:24:53 <Justin_o> zamcnema: let me know how it goes
2016-01-12T16:27:00 <kasparnet> simonjb, cindyli: If I want to look at the privacy settings for "li" when running the part of the FM locally, and the other at "staging-review4-fm.inclusivedesign.ca", which URL would I use
2016-01-12T16:27:08 <kasparnet> (ie. which URL should the PMT redirect to?)
2016-01-12T16:27:47 <simonjb> kasparnet: http://staging-review4-fm.inclusivedesign.ca/privacy-settings
2016-01-12T16:29:37 <kasparnet> simonjb: I was just about to write that it didn\'t seem to work and I just tried it -- but must have made a typo, cause your link worked
2016-01-12T16:29:39 <kasparnet> thanks!

2016-01-12T16:58:43 <Justin_o> jhung: can you take  look at this http://jobara.github.io/john-travoltage-html/
2016-01-12T17:08:22 <jhung> Justin_o: it looks good. The descriptions I think work well. The only oddity I did notice was that when you first start and gain a charge, the description updates to say "He has a small amount of negative charges.", but the quantity bar doesn\'t actually show any progress.
2016-01-12T17:08:54 <jhung> Also if you select "Restart Simulation", the description doesn\'t get reset.
2016-01-12T17:11:14 <Justin_o> jhung: yes, the latter is a bug i still need to fix. Not sure about the former though.
2016-01-12T17:11:25 <Justin_o> Maybe it\'s because the amount is too small

2016-01-12T17:57:22 <bens__> hi anastasiac, do you know if there is any info available I can look at about cognitive preferences (there is a reference to his here at open issue item 1:http://lists.idrc.ocad.ca/pipermail/globalpreferences/2016-January/001268.html)
2016-01-12T17:58:29 <anastasiac> bens__: I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we ever came up with a list of cognitive-specific preferences
2016-01-12T17:58:38 <anastasiac> we do have a page of research that might be helpful:
2016-01-12T17:58:41 <anastasiac> https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Designing+interfaces+to+meet+the+needs+of+users+with+cognitive+disabilities
2016-01-12T17:58:49 <anastasiac> it could give you some ideas
