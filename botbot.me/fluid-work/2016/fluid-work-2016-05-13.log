2016-05-13T20:35:40 <alanharnum> https://github.com/waharnum/chartAuthoring/blob/GPII-1584/src/js/pie.js#L89 is one example - a bunch of use of listeners with priorities rather than imperative function calls
2016-05-13T20:36:16 <alanharnum> anyway PaliwalSparsh that\'s what i\'ve got in my head right now
2016-05-13T20:36:26 <alanharnum> if you\'ve got specific questions feel free to ask them
2016-05-13T20:36:46 <alanharnum> i\'ve probably got more specific things given time to reflect (and I should begin writing that document while what I\'ve said is still fresh)
2016-05-13T20:37:40 <alanharnum> i think (Bosmon7 or someone else should correct me if I\'m wrong) that doing a lot of things with 3rd party libraries + Infusion is relatively new to us
2016-05-13T20:37:47 * colinclark has quit
2016-05-13T20:37:52 <alanharnum> so we\'re still learning what works / what doesn\'t & figuring out best practices ourselves
2016-05-13T20:38:02 <PaliwalSparsh> @alanharnum I am really sorry for not adding to the conversation i am beginner with infusion moreover have worked with only preference framework :( though this log will certainly be very helpful when i have worked more with infusion in a few days
2016-05-13T20:38:19 <alanharnum> no worries!
2016-05-13T20:38:43 <alanharnum> I\'ve been working with Infusion for less than a year myself, so I know what that feeling is like :)
2016-05-13T20:39:10 <PaliwalSparsh> Really thankyou for all the information. Now I need to figure out how to start with infusion.
2016-05-13T20:39:21 <PaliwalSparsh> properly
2016-05-13T20:39:27 <alanharnum> the tutorials at http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/index-tutorials.html are a good place
2016-05-13T20:40:15 <alanharnum> http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/FrameworkConcepts.html is also very helpful
2016-05-13T20:40:46 <Bosmon7> I can recommend our recent paper, if you would like a bit more underpinnings
2016-05-13T20:40:55 <Bosmon7> The FrameworkConcepts page is showing its age a bit.....
2016-05-13T20:41:24 <Bosmon7> https://github.com/amb26/papers/tree/master/onward-2016
2016-05-13T20:41:51 <Bosmon7> alanharnum - for certain kinds of things, such as jQuery UI widgets, we have been wrapping them for years
2016-05-13T20:42:09 * jhung has quit
2016-05-13T20:42:18 <Bosmon7> I think as "framworks in the wild" become progressively more invasive, we have to think harder about how to integrate them
2016-05-13T20:42:31 <Bosmon7> For example Google Polymer is probably going to be quite a challenge, but with a potentially huge payoff
2016-05-13T20:42:34 * alanharnum will one day write his "Infusion for Mere Mortals" tutorial
2016-05-13T20:43:07 <alanharnum> subtitled "How I Learned to Stop Worrying And Love IoC"
2016-05-13T20:43:36 <PaliwalSparsh> @alanharnum I would love to read that.
2016-05-13T20:44:14 <Bosmon7> Well it\'s the other stuff that\'s worrying :)
2016-05-13T20:44:17 <Bosmon7> The stuff that\'s not IoC
2016-05-13T20:44:20 <alanharnum> i\'d love to write it, so someday :)
2016-05-13T20:44:37 <PaliwalSparsh> @Bosmon7 @alanharnum Thanks for the help to start with infusion :)
2016-05-13T20:44:46 <alanharnum> you\'re very welcome
2016-05-13T20:45:15 <alanharnum> as may have been noted, I\'m a relative newcomer to Infusion myself, so I\'m (sometimes) a good person to ask about things that are confusing to newcomers :)
2016-05-13T20:45:16 <Bosmon7> Although we actually tend to stop talking about "IoC" these days
2016-05-13T20:45:23 <Bosmon7> Its a bit of a 2000s idea : P
2016-05-13T20:45:27 <alanharnum> not that i\'m not confused myself some of the time :p
2016-05-13T20:45:40 <alanharnum> i vote for doing away with "EL paths" first
2016-05-13T20:45:52 <Bosmon7> oh yes
2016-05-13T20:46:01 <Bosmon7> What a terrible name
2016-05-13T20:46:31 <Bosmon7> Well, people in the 1880s would talk about AERIAL STEAM CARRIAGES
2016-05-13T20:46:40 <Bosmon7> it\'s hard to make new things without naming them after old things : P
2016-05-13T20:48:41 <PaliwalSparsh> @alanharnum I will certainly need help with it :)
2016-05-13T20:56:12 <alanharnum> Bosmon7, this paper is super useful
2016-05-13T20:56:15 * alanharnum hadn\'t seen it yet
2016-05-13T20:56:23 <Bosmon7> alanharnum - yes I meant to circulate it more widely
2016-05-13T20:56:41 <Bosmon7> It was submitted to **ONWWARD** last month, we\'re expecting the unbridled savagery of the reviewers very soon
2016-05-13T20:56:55 <alanharnum> well it gets an A+ from me.
2016-05-13T20:57:06 <Bosmon7> That ADAPPTIBLE CATT VIDEO demo I gave at the community meeting 2 weeks ago was the demo from this paper

2016-05-13T21:10:27 <Bosmon7> Hey alanharnum ... I was all set up to response to this PR and I find that you have worked it all out already!
2016-05-13T21:10:28 <Bosmon7> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/705/files/82c4f72d5e72fd77db4061608b22bb5be4b437f8#r62894650
2016-05-13T21:10:32 <Bosmon7> Really brilliant work
2016-05-13T21:11:37 <alanharnum> thank you Bosmon7
2016-05-13T21:12:05 <alanharnum> the context-awareness stuff is really neat
2016-05-13T21:12:06 <Bosmon7> In fact, I was all set up to give you an answer that was wrong, as well, so just as well :)
2016-05-13T21:12:31 <alanharnum> was exactly what was needed to solve the problem
2016-05-13T21:12:42 <Bosmon7> I am still trying to explore the extent to which simple namespaced distributions and priorities can subsitute for contextAwareness
2016-05-13T21:13:02 <Bosmon7> But I think, in practice, they usually can\'t in situations in which there is any real depth
2016-05-13T21:13:40 <Bosmon7> Our "onward" paper was originally conceived of being about contextAwareness (in fact, I was reading Ungar\'s KORZ paper whilst I was planning the paper last year), but in the time since then, options distributions got a lot better
2016-05-13T21:13:46 <alanharnum> one thing I did find that I\'m reminded to mention is that makeGradeLinkage had what was (to me) unexpected behaviour
2016-05-13T21:13:46 * simonjb2 joined the channel
2016-05-13T21:13:51 <Bosmon7> And so when I came to write the paper, I wondered whether I could do without contextAwareness at all
2016-05-13T21:14:01 <Bosmon7> But in the end I think we still can\'t
2016-05-13T21:14:10 <alanharnum> which was that I couldn\'t discover by inspecting either a linked grade or the link-creating grade what grades were involved
2016-05-13T21:14:15 <Bosmon7> It\'s best to bear in mind that (as we remark in the paper) contextAwareness is a "user-level feature"
2016-05-13T21:14:15 <alanharnum> at least not easily
2016-05-13T21:14:33 <Bosmon7> That is it\'s the kind of facility that could be implemented by any framework user, and is just one example of such a scheme
2016-05-13T21:14:55 <alanharnum> i\'d been envisioning setting fluid.prefsWidgetType automatically based on the existing gradeLinkage
2016-05-13T21:15:00 <Bosmon7> alanharnum - what do you mean by "what grades are involved"?
2016-05-13T21:15:11 <Bosmon7> I mean, you always do see the grades in the finally instantiated components options.gradeNames
2016-05-13T21:15:26 <alanharnum> yeah it was the issue of having to instantiate
2016-05-13T21:15:34 <alanharnum> lemme be more clear
2016-05-13T21:16:09 <alanharnum> 1) fluid.makeGradeLinkage("fluid.textfieldSliderVariety", ["fluid.textfieldSlider"],["fluid.textfieldSliderNative"]) makes sure any fluid.textFieldSlider grade also includes fluid.textFieldSliderNative
2016-05-13T21:16:54 * jhernandez joined the channel
2016-05-13T21:17:01 <alanharnum> 2) When I ran fluid.defaults(fluid.textfieldSlider) I didn\'t see fluid.textFieldSliderNative present, which had been my intuitive expectation
2016-05-13T21:17:19 <Bosmon7> ah right
2016-05-13T21:17:24 <Bosmon7> The contents of fluid.defaults are always static
2016-05-13T21:17:40 <Bosmon7> Imagine it as if it is just a kind of "database".... which in the future it actually will be
2016-05-13T21:17:51 <Bosmon7> Thre will be a little module called fluid.store which just takes care of reading and writing defaults
2016-05-13T21:17:58 <alanharnum> 3) I also looked at the results of fluid.defaults(fluid.textfieldSliderVariety), and it didn\'t have something exposed that I could reliably parse
2016-05-13T21:18:03 <Bosmon7> You only know how a particular component is going to turn out once it starts to instantiate
2016-05-13T21:18:14 <Bosmon7> And the framework can even "change its mind" several times during this process
2016-05-13T21:18:15 <alanharnum> yeah i figured that out
2016-05-13T21:18:30 <Bosmon7> So to get a definitive answer, you actually need to wait until it is fully constructed
2016-05-13T21:18:53 <Bosmon7> The "new framework" will be a bit clearer about this and have a specific lifecycle point where it has fully committed to the grade content of an instantiating component
2016-05-13T21:18:56 <alanharnum> and the ability of the framework to "change its mind" means that it would be difficult to find out a definitive answer without constructing a component to see the results
2016-05-13T21:19:08 <Bosmon7> Not only difficult - ENTIRELY IMPOSSIBLE :)
2016-05-13T21:19:14 <Bosmon7> As Doctor Johnson once remarked about playing the violin
2016-05-13T21:19:40 * jhernandez has quit
2016-05-13T21:19:40 <alanharnum> it does create a challenge (to my mind) when you want to know a "fact" about a component, but don\'t want to actually instantiate it
2016-05-13T21:19:44 <Bosmon7> Yes
2016-05-13T21:19:49 <Bosmon7> This is what the new framework will help with
2016-05-13T21:19:59 <Bosmon7> Since once it gets to the "fully committed point" you will actually be able to ask it to STOP
2016-05-13T21:20:08 <alanharnum> yeah
2016-05-13T21:20:21 <Bosmon7> This will enable brilliant authoring facilities - for example, an IDE that can tell you whether a component is actually going to instantiate properly or not
2016-05-13T21:20:24 <Bosmon7> Without actually doing it
2016-05-13T21:20:45 <alanharnum> an outcome that builds the entire finalized JSON component configuration so it can be inspected / reflected, but stops short of the actual creation step
2016-05-13T21:20:52 <Bosmon7> But the details of how a component constructs depends potentially on every element of the entire component tree and its location in it
2016-05-13T21:21:30 <Bosmon7> It\'s a very "un-Computer Science-like" system : P
2016-05-13T21:21:36 <alanharnum> that would let me write a function that would decide based on a check that boiled down to "what would the state of this component be if I were to instantiate it, at this moment?"
2016-05-13T21:21:44 <Bosmon7> But rather more reminiscent of the way things work in the real world :)
2016-05-13T21:21:47 <Bosmon7> Yes, it would
2016-05-13T21:22:05 <Bosmon7> Although in practice, today, you can get a lot of the effects of that by just writing an expander or some such thing which depends on the grade content of the component
2016-05-13T21:22:18 <alanharnum> hm
2016-05-13T21:22:21 <Bosmon7> You\'re still "stuck" in the component\'s workflow, but you can still beat every other element of its own lifecycle
2016-05-13T21:22:26 <alanharnum> yeah, that would work as well
2016-05-13T21:22:53 <Bosmon7> The framework is inexorably committed, in its current form, to synchronously constructing the component - but you can still get into the workflow in time
2016-05-13T21:23:32 <Bosmon7> Once "options.gradeName" has been definitively observed by anyone, its contents are fixed
2016-05-13T21:23:48 <Bosmon7> As all options contents are fixed - the new framework will make this much clearer by making them immutable
2016-05-13T21:23:58 <Bosmon7> Sorry options.gradeNames
2016-05-13T21:24:49 <alanharnum> another thing I saw that I meant to ask about: do the keys in contextAwareness blocks need to be unique to individual components? I found I was getting errors when I had a block like this in multiple components: https://gist.github.com/waharnum/b99ae05a946bdfd7aaca81561b749e48
2016-05-13T21:25:12 <alanharnum> errors went away when I gave them all unique keys
2016-05-13T21:25:49 <Bosmon7> No, that should be fine
2016-05-13T21:26:08 <alanharnum> ok - I\'ll make sure it wasn\'t an implementation issue & report a bug then
2016-05-13T21:26:10 <Bosmon7> Could you create a test case out of the failing configs?
2016-05-13T21:26:11 <Bosmon7> Cheers
2016-05-13T21:26:29 * sepidehshahi has left the channel
2016-05-13T21:26:36 <Bosmon7> Although if you do have such blocks repeated, you should just factor them into a parent grade
2016-05-13T21:26:56 <alanharnum> they aren\'t completely repeated
2016-05-13T21:27:01 <Bosmon7> aha
2016-05-13T21:27:12 <Bosmon7> Well they are also meant to merge, too
2016-05-13T21:27:16 <Bosmon7> Which is why they have this keyed structure
2016-05-13T21:27:19 <alanharnum> i suspect that might be the issue
2016-05-13T21:27:25 <Bosmon7> So if there is even just one element in common, that can go into a parent grade
2016-05-13T21:27:30 <alanharnum> something with merging when they were part of the same parent, etc
2016-05-13T21:28:08 <Bosmon7> Ok, interesting
2016-05-13T21:28:20 <alanharnum> lemme dig into it a little more
2016-05-13T21:28:30 <alanharnum> i suspect it might be an implementation issue with grade merging
2016-05-13T21:28:36 <alanharnum> rather than an unexpected behaviour
2016-05-13T21:28:38 <Bosmon7> All the "makeAdaptation" shorthand relies on the fact that fresh entries can be injected into a contextAwareness block from anywhere
2016-05-13T21:28:52 <Bosmon7> So these blockes were definitely designed with merging in mind
2016-05-13T21:30:16 <alanharnum> to correct my sloppy language above: this wasn\'t in separate components, but in the two context-aware mix-in grades in https://github.com/waharnum/infusion/blob/2c009b5f8c85bd61532ec8747fc96ac9026dcc76/src/framework/preferences/js/StarterSchemas.js
2016-05-13T21:30:30 <alanharnum> so I think the issue is mine
2016-05-13T21:30:36 <alanharnum> looking more closely at what\'s happening
2016-05-13T21:30:49 <Bosmon7> Ok
2016-05-13T21:30:56 <Bosmon7> If the diagnostic isn\'t helpful, that should be improved too
2016-05-13T21:30:58 <alanharnum> i\'ll double check that next week
2016-05-13T21:31:05 <Bosmon7> So anything you can put together that fails unhelpfully will be welcome
2016-05-13T21:31:35 <alanharnum> will do
2016-05-13T21:31:56 <Bosmon7> awesome, thanks :)
2016-05-13T21:32:00 <alanharnum> have a good weekend!

2016-05-13T16:33:56 <amatas> Hi Bosmon, the production tests work and pass if the prefereces server url is substituted at a couple of config files in the vagrant production environment.
2016-05-13T16:35:26 <amatas> two last things need some work: https support and the inheritance of the config files to avoid the string substitution.
2016-05-13T16:37:19 <Bosmon> amatas - awesome!
2016-05-13T16:37:54 <amatas> :)

2016-05-13T17:58:57 <gtirloni> fluid-everyone: I\'m planning on restarting our servers to apply a critical kernel security fix (more details at https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-1033.html) today at 15:15PM EDT. Services should be unavailable for 3 minutes. If there are any concerns, please let me know.
2016-05-13T18:00:24 <gtirloni> i think i meant 14:15PM EDT, in roughly 15min if there are no concerns
2016-05-13T18:04:50 <colinclark> I have no concerns, gtirloni
2016-05-13T18:06:57 <Justin_o> gtirloni: when you are done that, can you help me with getting setup on OwnCloud. I tried resetting the password, but it doesn\'t seem to want to accept my new one.
2016-05-13T18:08:22 <gtirloni> sure, the pw reset functionality seems broken. i\'ll send you a new password
2016-05-13T18:10:08 <Justin_o> gtirloni: thanks
2016-05-13T18:12:39 <Justin_o> gtirloni: thanks, that worked
2016-05-13T18:14:00 <gtirloni> cool
2016-05-13T18:22:02 <gtirloni> services should be back already

2016-05-13T19:39:57 <Bosmon7> Oh oops, simonjb
2016-05-13T19:40:09 <Bosmon7> I remember now, I made a patch within gpii-express to fix that
2016-05-13T19:40:15 <Bosmon7> And forgot to tell ADTKINS about it
2016-05-13T19:40:19 <simonjb> aha!
2016-05-13T19:40:28 <Bosmon7> WEll, I did tell him about it
2016-05-13T19:41:57 <Bosmon7> In the form of the following JIRA: https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-1795
2016-05-13T19:42:07 <Bosmon7> But I forgot that I had patched it in my node_modules.....
2016-05-13T19:42:15 <Bosmon7> I\'ll fix that up now
2016-05-13T19:42:24 <simonjb> cool, thanks Bosmon
2016-05-13T19:42:39 <simonjb> and thanks Bosmon7 also

2016-05-13T19:54:45 <alanharnum> So PaliwalSparsh, did you have specific questions, or did you just want me to braindump on working with Infusion + other Javascript libraries?
2016-05-13T19:55:52 <PaliwalSparsh> @alanharnum I want to know everything about making third-party libraries work with infusion.
2016-05-13T19:55:58 <alanharnum> OK :)
2016-05-13T19:56:08 <alanharnum> well, I don\'t know everything, but I know some things :)
2016-05-13T19:56:20 <alanharnum> usually because Bosmon / Bosmon7 or someone else told me that I should change something :)
2016-05-13T19:57:19 <alanharnum> but talking about this now is a good way to get down what I have in my head (I\'ve got "Write up a document about Infusion + 3rd party libraries" on my lengthy to-do list)
2016-05-13T19:57:30 <Bosmon7> Yes, this does mark one of the crucial turning points in life
2016-05-13T19:57:47 <Bosmon7> When one turns from wanting to know everything to being content with knowing anything : P
2016-05-13T19:58:00 <PaliwalSparsh> If I get a good idea about it I may help you with it alanharnum
2016-05-13T19:58:30 <alanharnum> that would be great PaliwalSparsh
2016-05-13T19:59:07 <alanharnum> So my rules to date for working with Infusion + 3rd-party libraries (hard-learned and ever-evolving as I work more with Infusion...)
2016-05-13T20:00:14 <alanharnum> 1) Don\'t do things with the 3rd-party library that Infusion can already do. This one is hard because Infusion can do a lot of things - I\'ve been working with it for about a year and I still learn new things about it all the time
2016-05-13T20:00:32 <alanharnum> 1a) More experienced Infusion users will, when reviewing PRs, normally let you know if you\'ve done this. :)
2016-05-13T20:02:15 * gtirloni joined the channel
2016-05-13T20:02:30 <alanharnum> 2) Where appropriate, make sure the Infusion component you\'re using to act as a wrapper around the 3rd party library has information originating in the use of the 3rd-party library passed into it, usually to its model
2016-05-13T20:02:49 <alanharnum> this helps with #1 if you\'re doing things like events/listeners, DOM manipulation, etc
2016-05-13T20:02:54 <alanharnum> lemme find some code I can link to...
2016-05-13T20:04:00 <alanharnum> https://github.com/fluid-project/chartAuthoring/blob/master/src/js/d3ViewComponent.js#L201 is an example of a general function to do this for the D3-based Infusion components
2016-05-13T20:04:26 <alanharnum> whenever we create some elements with D3, we also push information about them into the wrapper component
2016-05-13T20:05:21 <Bosmon7> d3 was a particularly tough case.... since it isn\'t simply a component or a widget or an API, but a system with entirely its own idiom for data binding, rendering and DOM manipulation
2016-05-13T20:05:48 <alanharnum> that supports doing things like the function at https://github.com/fluid-project/chartAuthoring/blob/master/src/js/d3ViewComponent.js#L186, which lets us operate on D3-bound elements by their data keys, but using Infusion\'s paradigms
2016-05-13T20:06:23 <alanharnum> yeah, building D3 + Infusion integrations is not how I would have ideally started using Infusion :)
2016-05-13T20:07:09 <alanharnum> this mega-sized PR at https://github.com/fluid-project/chartAuthoring/pull/11 has a lot of useful discussion about the issues
2016-05-13T20:07:30 <alanharnum> unfortunately GitHub\'s PR interface does not have an "expand all comments" option so I can easily find them :(
2016-05-13T20:07:44 <alanharnum> I think Phaser will be an easier case to work with than D3
2016-05-13T20:08:08 <alanharnum> because it\'s not really concerned (or can be concerned) with things outside the game interface
2016-05-13T20:08:38 <alanharnum> it\'s probably going to be more like the case of this personal project I\'m working on: https://github.com/waharnum/infusion-leaflet
2016-05-13T20:08:53 <alanharnum> which is to try and build some Infusion-based components that use the Leaflet mapping library
2016-05-13T20:10:12 <alanharnum> The fluid.leaflet.map component at https://github.com/waharnum/infusion-leaflet/blob/master/src/leaflet-infusion.js#L88 is a very bare-bones example of starting to build a wrapper around 3rd party library functionality
2016-05-13T20:11:17 <alanharnum> lemme take a quick look at Phaser (I\'ve looked at it in the past, but not done anything significant with it) to make sure any comments I make won\'t be entirely off base
2016-05-13T20:13:37 * gtirloni joined the channel
2016-05-13T20:15:09 <alanharnum> yeah as I thought the basic approach is probably more similar to what I\'m trying to do with Leaflet than what we did with D3
2016-05-13T20:15:50 <alanharnum> since Phaser basically only concerns itself with the game stuff in the canvas and can\'t (as Bosmon7 says about D3) do data binding, rendering and DOM manipulation
2016-05-13T20:21:27 <alanharnum> If I were starting to build out a wrapper, I\'d start with something like "fluid.phaser.game" that puts what looks like the core game loop (the preload / create / update functions I see on http://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-game)
2016-05-13T20:21:47 <alanharnum> inside an Infusion component
2016-05-13T20:22:02 <alanharnum> which uses the fluid.viewComponent grade
2016-05-13T20:22:17 <alanharnum> similar to what I\'ve done with https://github.com/waharnum/infusion-leaflet/blob/master/src/leaflet-infusion.js
2016-05-13T20:23:54 * jhernandez has quit
2016-05-13T20:24:41 <alanharnum> that would evolve as I worked on the actual development of the game into something more like https://github.com/fluid-project/chartAuthoring/blob/master/src/js/d3ViewComponent.js, which is a base for more complex Infusion-based components that use D3
2016-05-13T20:25:47 <alanharnum> anyway i started doing a numbered list and then I just started talking, so to sum up...
2016-05-13T20:26:49 <alanharnum> 1) Don\'t do things Infusion can do with the 3rd-party library. This shouldn\'t be too much of an issue with Phaser, because Phaser doesn\'t do many of the things Infusion does, and vice-versa.
2016-05-13T20:27:54 <alanharnum> 2) Pass appropriate information into the Infusion component from whatever the 3rd party library is doing. Exactly what is "appropriate" is going to really vary depending on what you\'re doing, so it\'s unfortunately hard to be more specific than that.
2016-05-13T20:29:20 <alanharnum> 3) Where appropriate, give the Infusion component appropriate functionality around interacting with the 3rd party library as part of the wrapper component. Something like the Invoker at https://github.com/waharnum/infusion-leaflet/blob/master/src/leaflet-infusion.js#L110 is a really basic example of that.

2016-05-13T20:30:21 * gtirloni has quit
2016-05-13T20:32:48 <alanharnum> 4) This is my only piece of really specific advice that occurs at this time: if you\'re doing anything complex with sequencing in executing third-party code, look at breaking that up into a series of listeners + events in the wrapper component
2016-05-13T20:33:01 <alanharnum> lemme a find an example of #4 from my own code...
