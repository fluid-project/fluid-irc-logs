2016-08-04T14:00:58 <Justin_o> avtar: yes, and hope not
2016-08-04T14:01:27 <Justin_o> avtar: i think it would be a fairly quick chat

2016-08-04T17:13:30 <Justin_o> Bosmon: hello.. i\'m taking a quick look at https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5799
2016-08-04T17:13:59 <Justin_o> for point ii), would you still want the error to be logged and a hint output
2016-08-04T17:15:16 <Justin_o> for example in your case it might say "If the tag already exists run "git tag -d v1.1.0" to remove the existing tag?
2016-08-04T17:15:37 <Justin_o> or maybe just "use the \'git tag -d\' command to remove the existing tag
2016-08-04T17:15:55 <Justin_o> i don\'t think i\'ll know the actual tag name as this comes from the template
2016-08-04T17:16:59 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i guess we also don\'t really know if they are using a git command, as it could be switched in the options

2016-08-04T17:32:15 * colinclark joined the channel
2016-08-04T17:37:43 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I think the full message looks good, yes
2016-08-04T17:39:05 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks, the only issue is that the actual user may not even be using git.. should we worry about that case though
2016-08-04T17:39:28 <Justin_o> and we may not know the actual version number either
2016-08-04T17:39:34 <Justin_o> sorry, tag name
2016-08-04T17:39:49 <Justin_o> but we could parse the template if we expect that it is a git command
2016-08-04T17:41:38 <avtar> Justin_o: yes
2016-08-04T17:41:46 <avtar> is there a room we\'re using?
2016-08-04T17:42:04 <Justin_o> avtar: uh, i guess you can just connect to my room
2016-08-04T17:45:17 * clown_mtg has quit
2016-08-04T17:45:55 <Bosmon> Justin_o - how could it be that the user is not using git, if the script has managed to invoke it?
2016-08-04T17:46:25 <Justin_o> Bosmon: all the commands are configurable.. so they can be replaced with mercurial commands for example
2016-08-04T17:46:29 <Justin_o> theoretically anyways
2016-08-04T17:46:59 <Bosmon> ok
2016-08-04T17:47:14 <Bosmon> Then we should add an extra template in order to render this message
2016-08-04T17:48:18 <Justin_o> ah that\'s reasonable
