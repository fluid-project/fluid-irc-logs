2016-08-09T15:22:30 <jhung> Justin_o: well I wanted to see if I can get it working with a simple test case first. I'm going to try with the actual site now.
2016-08-09T15:22:58 <Justin_o> jhung: cool
2016-08-09T15:23:58 <Justin_o> jhung: how does your test example work

2016-08-09T16:47:26 <colinclark> hey jhung and gtirloni, I was just looking at Jon's recent commit to the Floe Project site, and it raised a question for me...
2016-08-09T16:47:58 <colinclark> in this era of free certs from Let's Encrypt and so on, why wouldn't we host the Guide site over https by default?
2016-08-09T16:49:27 <gtirloni> i don't have a technical reason for why not. i can work on enabling that for all websites
2016-08-09T16:55:24 <gtirloni> i'll keep you all posted about the progress
2016-08-09T16:55:44 <jhung> thanks gtirloni.

2016-08-09T17:21:21 <gtirloni> no worries. it's 2016, we should be using https everywhere. 100% agree

2016-08-09T18:14:52 <michelled> yeah, you need to vagrant reload
2016-08-09T18:15:38 <simonjb> awesome, thanks

2016-08-09T19:03:30 <danayo> TPark, godfrey_: in going through your examples doc a question came to mind - did you find the suggested links from each page helpful - for example, the Practices linked from the Principles pages, the Principles listed on the Practice pages, or Tools linked from the Practices pages. I ask because I noticed that in many cases, your flow does not necessarily follow these links (which is fine)
2016-08-09T19:07:16 <danayo> I was particualary interested in your flow from Co-Design to Usability Testing - because they can sometimes be in opposition, or at least, formal usability testing often isn\xe2\x80\x99t a part of a co-design process - I\xe2\x80\x99m interested in your thoughts about that
