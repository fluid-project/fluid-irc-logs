2016-06-24T13:31:06 <Justin_o> jhung: yes

2016-06-24T14:18:13 * lliskovoi joined the channel
2016-06-24T14:18:21 <colinclark> we definitely had users when sepidehshahi and co. were doing sonification testing for the Chart Authoring tool who had limits to what pitches they could here
2016-06-24T14:18:39 <colinclark> hear
2016-06-24T14:19:09 <colinclark> hence the need for a more contstrained bandwidth (frequency range) version of a sonification
2016-06-24T14:19:24 <colinclark> there\'s a lot to explore when it comes to personalization of soundscapes and sonifications
2016-06-24T14:19:46 <colinclark> which, to the best of my knowledge, hasn\'t yet been explored from the lens of accessibility and inclusive design
2016-06-24T14:22:05 <jhung> colinclark: it\'d be good if we get the opportunity to explore this a bit more. The audio needs of PhET sims in a classroom could help us toward solutions for other situations (i.e. audio settings for first discovery).
2016-06-24T14:22:16 <colinclark> yes, it\'s true

2016-06-24T14:53:09 <sepidehshahi> sorry colinclark and jhung, I was in a meeting. Yes, during our user testing sessions, there were a few users who mentioned they could not easily recognize different pitches. Even one of them was playing an instrument but still had hard time recognizing pitch. Volume was more commonly recognized by most users. They could also differenciate different types of sounds (different instruments) or the rate of beats and rhythm. If you giv
2016-06-24T14:53:09 <sepidehshahi> me more details about what you are looking for jhung_afk, I might be able to recall more relevant information from our user testings.

2016-06-24T15:20:03 <Justin_o> colinclark, Bosmon, alanharnum: In case you are interested, here are some test instances for the UIO Optimization that I have set up. The results shown here were all performed off of my machine hosted from our vagrant web server. So results that you might have testing through the CDN may be different.
2016-06-24T15:20:03 <Justin_o> https://cdn.rawgit.com/jobara/prefsFramework-optimization-examples/9d45ffd8c4455917a8d7792e1548073065e6092c/index.html

2016-06-24T15:22:50 <alanharnum> were you using a specific tool for this?
2016-06-24T15:23:07 <Justin_o> I used the chrome debugger to gather all the metrics
2016-06-24T15:23:11 <Justin_o> alanharnum: ^
2016-06-24T15:23:47 <jhung> sepidehshahi: we\'re looking into sonification for PhET and we\'re interested in the issue of perception of sound in a classroom environment. How much sound can be processed and understood? What are some technology limitations? What are some user needs we should be aware of, etc.
2016-06-24T15:24:14 <alanharnum> it might be interesting to try throttling the connectivity to simulate different connection types, a la: https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/profile/network-performance/network-conditions?hl=en
2016-06-24T15:25:29 <alanharnum> can I ask a non-optimization UIO question? :)
2016-06-24T15:25:31 * PaliwalSparsh has quit
2016-06-24T15:25:37 <Justin_o> alanharnum: that could be interesting too.. i\'m currently trying to get an idea of the baselines before further optimization work
2016-06-24T15:25:42 <Justin_o> sure
2016-06-24T15:26:06 <alanharnum> the interesting thing about those results for me is that it says under ideal network conditions (ha!), most optimization is probably code-level
2016-06-24T15:26:16 * Yan_Hu joined the channel
2016-06-24T15:26:32 <alanharnum> unless we can find radically more efficient approaches to Load
2016-06-24T15:26:41 <alanharnum> at least within the context of UIO standalone
2016-06-24T15:27:35 <alanharnum> OK, so for the Dashboard work I\'ve rolled a version of UIO that relays "significant" preference changes from its model to another component
2016-06-24T15:27:41 <alanharnum> so that a user can keep track of what they change and when
2016-06-24T15:27:54 <alanharnum> monitoring the model changes ends up with stuff that looks like this: "fluid_prefs_textFont changed to comic"
2016-06-24T15:28:01 <Justin_o> alanharnum: i\'ll also have to try it when your slider pull goes in.
2016-06-24T15:28:13 <alanharnum> what is the easiest way for me to resolve those internal names to human-readable strings?
2016-06-24T15:28:46 <alanharnum> i\'m figuring it\'s something with hooking into the message resolving behaviour or similar, but am not sure where to start looking
2016-06-24T15:29:39 <Justin_o> alanharnum: the fluid_prefs_textFont I believe is a transformation of the prefs type with the "." replaced by "_". So the original type would have been fluid.prefs.textFont
2016-06-24T15:29:53 <sepidehshahi> jhung: this is very interesting. because even in our one on one testing, users had such wide range of needs. for some we had to adjust the volume. Some could hear a specific sound and some couldn\xe2\x80\x99t. So personalizing an experience in a class setting might be challenging if you play the audio for the entire class, unless each student has their own audio and can adjust it (via headphones or something)
2016-06-24T15:30:23 <Justin_o> alanharnum: i can\'t quite remember, but i believe that is done in the builder or auxBuilder layer
2016-06-24T15:30:44 <Justin_o> alanharnum: so i\'m not really sure what you are hoping to do
2016-06-24T15:30:54 * michelled1 has quit
2016-06-24T15:30:56 <Justin_o> alanharnum: that is, what would you like it to be
2016-06-24T15:31:03 <alanharnum> Justin_o: basically, I\'ve got the information from the model
2016-06-24T15:31:29 <alanharnum> I need to figure out the best way of resolving those into the human readable terms as we have in the message bundles.
2016-06-24T15:39:48 * wannabeCitizen has quit
2016-06-24T15:41:51 <Justin_o> alanharnum: i\'m not exactly sure i understand, but i think what you want is actually going to be in the actual adjuster for it.
2016-06-24T15:42:04 <alanharnum> yeah, that\'s what I\'m thinking as wel
2016-06-24T15:42:21 <alanharnum> i\'ll need to do something like an options distribution or relay to surface the messages to a place i can use them
2016-06-24T15:42:27 <alanharnum> sorry for being vague, but that\'s helpful
2016-06-24T15:42:36 <colinclark> oh alanharnum, I forgot to mention at standup that I made you a pull request--I\'m sure you won\'t have time to look at it until you\'re back from vacation
2016-06-24T15:42:39 <colinclark> but there it is :)
2016-06-24T15:43:07 <Justin_o> alanharnum:  yah i think something like that would work.. i\'m heading offline now, but cindyli might be able to assist you if you have more questions about this.. have a good vacation
2016-06-24T15:43:32 <alanharnum> Justin_o: I can see there\'s a messageBase object in the panel options, which has the strings i\'m looking for
2016-06-24T15:43:53 <alanharnum> colinclark: yes, I think that will wait until after vacay probably :)
2016-06-24T15:43:59 <alanharnum> thanks Justin_o! You have a good one too
2016-06-24T15:45:47 <colinclark> have a nice vacation, Justin_o!
2016-06-24T15:46:04 <colinclark> alanharnum: If I have some spare cycles, should I chip away at it while you\'re away?
2016-06-24T15:46:12 <alanharnum> colinclark: sure
2016-06-24T15:46:19 <colinclark> who knows, but it was pretty interesting
2016-06-24T15:46:37 <colinclark> I think we can also do some refactoring of the sonifier--more events
2016-06-24T15:46:41 <alanharnum> ya
2016-06-24T15:47:01 * gtirloni has quit
2016-06-24T15:47:14 <alanharnum> the conversion of the chart data to the sonification data is pretty damn ugly right now
2016-06-24T15:48:01 <alanharnum> i feel best about the scheduling management, which is handling a somewhat complex challenge in getting Flocking and text-to-speech to play fairly well together
2016-06-24T15:48:15 <colinclark> yes
2016-06-24T15:48:27 <colinclark> that kind of scheduling is complex regardless of what system you\'re using
2016-06-24T15:48:39 <colinclark> Bergson will make this a tiny bit smoother in the future
2016-06-24T15:48:45 <colinclark> a bit more declarative, hopefully
2016-06-24T15:49:02 <colinclark> I\'m really hoping to get Flocking to the point where a lot of the redundancy of transforming from data into these little "schedules" can be removed
2016-06-24T15:49:13 <colinclark> it\'s the worst, and just a limitation of Flocking today
