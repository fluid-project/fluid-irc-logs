2016-03-11T16:40:58 <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: standup update: sorry. I\'ve been having some audio trouble when trying to do the PGA testing too, so i wonder if it\'s related. Anyways 1) i\'m working a half day today and expected to be offline soon, but may stay a bit longer to try to get more PGA testing done 2) continuing work on testing FD for PGA 3) if anyone has time to look at Infusion
2016-03-11T16:40:58 <Justin_o> pull requests there are a bunch to look at.

2016-03-11T19:15:32 <amanvar> In this bug "https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5874" can I change the html page into more interactive UI .
2016-03-11T19:39:50 <jhung> amanvar: if that is something beyond just the bug fix, we would recommend you file a "feature request" or "improvement" issue in the bug tracker. We like to keep the scope of work limited to the bug being fixed so that we can track changes and test more easily.
2016-03-11T19:44:40 <amanvar> In this page "http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/uiOptions" the content is in column wise. Is it ok if I change into row wise. And UI is looking good in row wise.

2016-03-11T22:18:57 <akshay> started with the coding, wanted to quickly show a workable demo to justin, this is not the most organised piece of code, I have to modify it into a proper structured with various game states.
2016-03-11T22:19:57 <akshay> Moreover the various game arts would have to be modified.

2016-03-11T22:27:39 <akshay> Couldn\'t do it a bit early as I was setting the environment up for the infusion framework. Somehow I missed to read the Brainstorming child page previously.
2016-03-11T22:29:01 <akshay> https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Gamification This is cool. This has given more more new ideas.
2016-03-11T22:31:11 <akshay> I had a specific question for @danayo @justin . Based on this "Game for early digital literacy that teaches the basics of coding/design/etc".
2016-03-11T22:33:40 <akshay> To teach coding which is very well a part of early digital literacy can I also extend my idea to include a Blocky based game

2016-03-11T13:58:45 <Justin_o> bwepngong: you could probably do a search on "learning to learn" or "metacognition" in relation to learning or education. What we\'re referring to here is about a learner driven approach for discovering  and choosing what preferences work best for them.
2016-03-11T14:00:57 <bwepngong> Thanks.
2016-03-11T14:01:20 <bwepngong> I will do more research before I ask more meaningful questions.
2016-03-11T14:01:56 <bwepngong> Meanwhile I will take on one of the bug fixes and be working with

2016-03-11T14:06:44 <jhung> Awesome_A: the choice is completely up to you. We don\'t want the choice of front end framework to restrict possibilities.

2016-03-11T14:20:03 <akshay> hi justin_o, this is regarding the question about the game arts that @danayo asked me yesterday.
2016-03-11T14:22:05 <akshay> are you guys fine with the open game arts or do you want new game arts particulary designed for this game?
2016-03-11T14:22:50 <akshay> moreover some of the arts in the mockups were designed by me.
2016-03-11T14:25:20 <Justin_o> bwepngong: okay, sounds good.. let us know if you have more questions
2016-03-11T14:25:59 <Ng3a> Hi jhung, interested in the WebRTC project and have looked through  appr.tc demo. I would like to ask if you got links to any open source app that works like vidyo?
2016-03-11T14:26:00 <Justin_o> akshay: i saw you\'re conversation with danayo from yesterday and was meaning to talk to you about that.
2016-03-11T14:27:17 <Justin_o> akshay: so in short anything you produce yourself, whether code, graphics, and etc. must have an open license... in regards to anything you use, whether code, graphics or etc. these should also have an open license..
2016-03-11T14:29:49 <Justin_o> akshay: now what that license is and how you can use it are important to keep in mind. We tend not to use things that are GPL because of their viral nature, as we prefer our deliverables to be usable by anyone and any application. Also, keep in mind other restrictions on the license. Typically you have to attribute the license holder.
2016-03-11T14:30:53 <Justin_o> akshay: in regards to the assets you acquired from Unity. I\'m not sure what the license is but I\'m going to guess that only you have the license to use them. I doubt you could provide it as part of an open source project as this would be something that would be shared and distributed.
2016-03-11T14:32:05 <akshay> Justin_o: yes, I read about that in details yesterday.
2016-03-11T14:32:06 * simonjb joined the channel
2016-03-11T14:34:21 <akshay> The game arts available at http://opengameart.org are mostly licensed under Creative Commons or GNU GPL
2016-03-11T14:34:43 <akshay> so those would be suitable for this project.
2016-03-11T14:35:08 <Ng3a> Justin_o: Hi, am interested in the WebRTC project and have looked through  appr.tc demo. I would like to ask if you got links to any open source app that works like vidyo?
2016-03-11T14:35:12 <jhung> hi Ng3a. Thanks for your interest. gtirloni is the mentor on that project but unfortunately he isn\'t around currently.
2016-03-11T14:35:20 * PaliwalSparsh has quit
2016-03-11T14:35:44 <akshay> In case its released under Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 we would need to attribute the author.
2016-03-11T14:37:31 <Justin_o> you should still keep a reference to all 3rd party items you are using, where they come from and what their licenses are. something like this https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/ReleaseNotes.md#third-party-software-in-infusion
2016-03-11T14:37:33 <Ng3a> jhung: Thanks! Just hang around hoping to hear from him anytime soon.
2016-03-11T14:38:45 <Justin_o> akshay: ^^
2016-03-11T14:39:50 <akshay> Ya that ofcourse has to be done, but say I need some specific game arts while working on the project and I don\'t get decent ones having a free license
2016-03-11T14:40:36 <akshay> so how\'s that supposed to be done.
2016-03-11T14:41:53 <akshay> I mean do I need to design the game arts by myself , which I definitely can do, I have designed may using adobe illustrator and inkscape,
2016-03-11T14:42:03 <akshay> *many
2016-03-11T14:42:44 <akshay> or I would be getting support from your designers.
2016-03-11T14:42:50 <akshay> ?
2016-03-11T14:43:23 <Justin_o> akshay: yes, if you can\'t find any that have a suitable license  and you are able to make something yourself, I\'d suggest that you do that. The alternative would be to talk to danayo to see if there is anything that we could help with or to make use of what you can find that does have the appropriate license.
2016-03-11T14:45:15 <akshay> cool then my adobe illustrator skills would come handy :)
2016-03-11T14:45:53 <Justin_o> akshay: yes, the should :)
2016-03-11T14:48:47 <akshay> anyways justin, after doing a lot of designing and writing that big chunk of documentation of my understanding of the project , I have started off with coding.
2016-03-11T14:50:30 <Justin_o> akshay: okay, and don\'t forget to put together a proposal using the format from the template we have on our GSoC orgs page.
2016-03-11T14:50:41 <akshay> I would show you a working demo of one of the UI mockups in a couple of hours.
2016-03-11T14:50:49 <Justin_o> akshay: cool thanks
2016-03-11T14:51:19 <Justin_o> akshay: i might be offline a bit earlier today, but i expect to be around for a couple hours more.
2016-03-11T14:52:13 * the-t-in-rtf joined the channel
2016-03-11T14:52:34 <akshay> then I guess I could show you whatever I have done till now. I would have to put it online.
2016-03-11T14:55:25 <akshay> Its not a very organised piece of code , I did it an hour, it\'s just to showcase a workable UI mockup, the actual one would be more modular and designed to be extended to other projects easily.

2016-03-11T14:57:10 <PaliwalSparsh> @Justin_o @danayo I guess I was thinking about the project in the wrong way, the project is intended to use game as an interactive way of finding preferences so that they can be used everywhere (all applications where preferences find a place) which the user would use, including the small game that comes with it, rather I was thinking concentrating on mainly on the game. I guess that was the reason mockups included mainly the preference
2016-03-11T14:57:10 <PaliwalSparsh> discovery part. Please can you correct me on this thought of mine if i am wrong.
2016-03-11T14:58:16 * clown joined the channel
2016-03-11T14:58:32 <akshay> justin_o : Regarding the proposal I would be working on that tomorrow and would upload it on Google Docs tomorrow.
2016-03-11T14:59:07 <Justin_o> akshay: sounds good, i think applications for GSoC open up on Monday.
2016-03-11T15:00:01 <akshay> I would need your help with writing the proposal as this is the first time applying for a GSOC Project.
2016-03-11T15:01:59 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: sounds like your on the right track. We would really want the user to "learn" about choosing and discovering preferences and finding out what works best. The first discovery tool is an example of that and those preference could then be applied to an application or operation system.
2016-03-11T15:06:53 <akshay> PaliwalSparsh: You can go through this which Justin pointed to me earlier this week, http://gpii.net/ConsumerBenefits. This might help you with your ideas.
2016-03-11T15:10:06 * the-t-in-rtf has quit
2016-03-11T15:12:59 <PaliwalSparsh> @Justin_o I have been through the tutorial of uiOption for Preference framework and infusion and I am presently reading through the First discovery tool how there were three predefined editors but here they made there own editor for first discovery tool with new custom components and that are facilitated by infusion framework. I will read the rest code for first discovery tool too. Is there anything else I need to get a look at. Thanks @akshay
2016-03-11T15:13:00 <PaliwalSparsh> I will certainly have a look at it.
2016-03-11T15:14:49 <PaliwalSparsh> facilitated by infusion i guess it may convey something wrong i meant in same way as preference framework and its components were written using infusion.
2016-03-11T15:18:28 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: hmm.. can\'t think of anything off the top of my head. I guess just make sure, as you read through all those things, that you are developing your thoughts on how you will take on the project.
2016-03-11T15:20:48 <nrda> justin_o: this is regarding \'FLUID-4770 Emptying queue causes Browse Files button to be misaligned\', i have solved the issue for the internet explorer and tested it on IE, you can have a look at it https://www.dropbox.com/s/el2zhv024w3atev/12825499_1730318493847224_1111156313_n.jpg?dl=0
2016-03-11T15:22:10 <PaliwalSparsh> @Justin_o: I was working through them with same mindset only thank you. Also I wanted to take your advice on that I was also interested in webRTC project, is it possible to apply for multiple projects and should i try it, and does the organisation have priority for some project over other.
2016-03-11T15:22:11 <Justin_o> nrda: from your screenshot that looks better. Did you update the pull request?
2016-03-11T15:22:33 <Justin_o> nrda: also did you happen to look at why the text goes from "Browse files" to "Browse Files"
2016-03-11T15:24:31 <nrda> justin_o: when the page is initially opened then the text comes from Uploader.html, but after that js controls everything, so it was the html page which need to be updated
2016-03-11T15:24:40 * colinclark joined the channel
2016-03-11T15:24:43 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: it\'s not a bad idea to apply for multiple projects, it seems like we\'ll have multiple candidates per project and we don\'t know for sure how many slots we\'ll get from Google either. Try to look out for gtirloni to ask about the WebRTC project.
2016-03-11T15:24:57 <nrda> justin_o: I will update my pull request now
2016-03-11T15:25:21 <nrda> justin_o: I thought its better to show you first
2016-03-11T15:25:28 <Justin_o> nrda: hmm.. perhaps we have a localization issue as well then...
2016-03-11T15:25:35 <Justin_o> nrda: thanks for showing me, and for updating your pull request..
2016-03-11T15:26:32 <PaliwalSparsh> @Justin_o Great then and does the organisation have priority for some project over other
2016-03-11T15:27:09 <PaliwalSparsh> *others
2016-03-11T15:27:16 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: not really

2016-03-11T15:39:40 <nrda> justin_o: I was going through the GSoC idea page, and i find \'Accessible, Responsive Music UI Controls\' and \'Implement User Interface / Learner Options Responsive Design\' interesting. I was wondering whether in the project involving UI options one just needs to make the current UI option demo responsive to mobiles and tablets or also to improvise the current demo.
2016-03-11T15:40:33 <Justin_o> nrda: what do you mean by improvise?
2016-03-11T15:40:57 <nrda> justin_o: By improvising i mean something like an User interface update as suggested in FLUID-5738 or add some new features
2016-03-11T15:41:17 <Justin_o> nrda: also best to talk to hung about the UI Options responsive design project and simonjb about the music controls
2016-03-11T15:41:51 <nrda> justin_o: ok, thanks
2016-03-11T15:42:06 <Justin_o> nrda: actually some of those changes might make sense as we do want things to be consistent
2016-03-11T15:42:41 <Justin_o> nrda: i think it would be good to work that into your proposal if you can, but talk to jhung about it to be sure.
2016-03-11T15:43:22 <nrda> justin_o: thanks for the help
2016-03-11T15:45:19 <Awesome_A> jhung: I don\'t if anybody has made the remark on http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/uiOptions/ the text in the columns are in disorder on chrome browser

2016-03-11T15:46:04 <Awesome_A> I wish to know if I can create an issue concerning that.
2016-03-11T15:47:38 <jhung> nrda, Awesome_A, Justin_o - catching up on the conversation now\xe2\x80\xa6

2016-03-11T15:52:44 <jhung> nrda: I agree with what Justin_o has said - if you can work in any bug fixes or improvements into your proposal, that would be great. You would have to consider the benefits and extra time needed against the goal of the project.
2016-03-11T15:55:05 <jhung> Awesome_A: what is the issue exactly? I\'m looking at it in Chrome right now and not quite sure what to look for.
2016-03-11T15:56:36 <Awesome_A> The text in the paragraph with heading "Why do oranges taste better than apples?"
2016-03-11T15:57:26 <Awesome_A> my chrome version: 48.0
2016-03-11T15:59:04 <jhung> Awesome_A: ah. I wasn\'t seeing it because I had a contrast theme enabled. If you turn on a theme, the overlapping text actually disappears. But when you reset it back to default, you will see the text overlapping the headers.
2016-03-11T15:59:16 <jhung> Is that what you\'re seeing Awesome_A?
2016-03-11T15:59:26 <Awesome_A> The last line of the paragraph is moved to the on top of the apple image
2016-03-11T15:59:28 <Awesome_A> yes
2016-03-11T15:59:56 <Awesome_A> Exactly when change theme it disappears
2016-03-11T16:02:02 <jhung> Awesome_A: You can create bug reports in Jira. You can file one for this issue. Include all needed details and a screen capture would help too.
2016-03-11T16:02:21 <Awesome_A> ok
