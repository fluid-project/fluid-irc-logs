2016-04-27T20:16:41 <danayo> Bosmon, Bosmon7: those things you said at the end of our meeting, about the thing needing to be the thing that actually does the thing / that everything that things do needs to be manifest in the interface, and that this describes a very different way of designing things ...
2016-04-27T20:16:45 <danayo> (I may be misquoting you horribly)
2016-04-27T20:17:15 <danayo> but I\'d like to know more about that
2016-04-27T20:17:52 <danayo> about those THINGS
2016-04-27T20:19:59 * alanharnum joined the channel
2016-04-27T20:22:20 <Bosmon> danayo yes!
2016-04-27T20:22:23 <Bosmon> SO SAY WE ALL :)
2016-04-27T20:23:05 <clown> jhernandez:  Fixed that memory leak in the xrandr add-on.  Pushed to my branch.
2016-04-27T20:23:10 <Bosmon> I guess this is partially implicit in what we mean when we talk about "designing for further design"
2016-04-27T20:24:26 <danayo> not sure I understand the connection Bosmon
2016-04-27T20:24:27 * alanharnum has quit
2016-04-27T20:24:54 <Bosmon> The so-called "user-continued design"
2016-04-27T20:25:09 <Bosmon> Could only happen, if the artefact they were delivered were the same one that was used for design
2016-04-27T20:25:23 <Bosmon> Or at least remained in direct, intimate connection with it
2016-04-27T20:26:47 <Bosmon> But naturally this interaction, too, needs to be "designed".....
2016-04-27T20:26:56 * alanharnum joined the channel
2016-04-27T20:27:25 <Bosmon> That is, the way that user design tools "shade into" "professional" design tools
2016-04-27T20:28:22 <Bosmon> Our presentation about polymer last week was particularly ridiculous from the point of view of suggesting that polymer was any kind of answer to our design workflow problems
2016-04-27T20:28:46 <Bosmon> Since noone was suggesting that polymer immediately called into existence open source, polymer based versions of Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop
2016-04-27T20:38:39 * anvk has quit
2016-04-27T20:39:06 <danayo> perhaps an authoring environment could provide a familiar example Bosmon ?  of a thing (designed artefact) that is the thing that allows further design ?
2016-04-27T20:39:33 <Bosmon> Well, there are almost no effective examples of this
2016-04-27T20:39:43 <Bosmon> We covered a few in our community meetings
2016-04-27T20:40:06 <danayo> yes
2016-04-27T20:40:09 <Bosmon> For example a Hypercard app is one example.... next week we\'ll see that a Self app is too, in a similar sort of way
2016-04-27T20:40:30 <Bosmon> But the kinds of redesign that these allow to ordinary end users are extremely limited
2016-04-27T20:41:00 <Bosmon> Perhaps primarily through not allowing user communities to organise themselves by being helped to find other communities who have similar artefacts
2016-04-27T20:41:16 <Bosmon> I think in the end this has to be the foremost of the methods of "redesign"
2016-04-27T20:41:35 <Bosmon> Simply the ability to locate and use "nearby" artefacts, ones similar to yours
2016-04-27T20:41:51 <Bosmon> Either similar because a similar community to yours has adapted them, or perhaps your own community has in the past
2016-04-27T20:43:34 <danayo> +1 to redesign by sharing artefacts
2016-04-27T20:49:00 <alanharnum> makes me think of sewing patterns
2016-04-27T20:51:27 <danayo> oh! how so alanharnum
2016-04-27T20:51:42 <alanharnum> that idea of reusing and adapting artifacts by end users
2016-04-27T20:52:06 <Bosmon> Yes
2016-04-27T20:52:12 <Bosmon> Only there is a CRUCIAL DIFFERENCE!
2016-04-27T20:52:34 <Bosmon> In that only the most expert sewer is capable, given an example of a garment, of reconstructing the pattern which could be used to produce it
2016-04-27T20:52:50 <Bosmon> Whereas in our world, the RECIPE FOR AN ARTEFACT WILL BE COEXTENSIVE WITH **THE ARTEFACT ITSELF**!!!!
2016-04-27T20:53:01 <alanharnum> yes, and there\'s not really a separation between the pattern and the produced artifact
2016-04-27T20:53:05 <alanharnum> in software
2016-04-27T20:53:16 <Bosmon> There is, there is the hugest one
2016-04-27T20:53:38 <Bosmon> It requires an even greater expert, given a running application, to reconstruct the source code for it : P
2016-04-27T20:54:39 <alanharnum> i think i\'m thinking more sociologically in terms of the "community" analogy
2016-04-27T20:54:51 <danayo> I am seeing a dress made of pieces of a paper sewing pattern stitched together
2016-04-27T20:55:04 <Bosmon> Yes
2016-04-27T20:55:05 <alanharnum> about how we might structure communities of exchange for software artifacts
2016-04-27T20:55:17 <Bosmon> In the world we are dreaming of, the paper is always there
2016-04-27T20:55:23 <danayo> :)
2016-04-27T20:55:40 <alanharnum> there are hundreds of different patterns for shirts, FE, but there is a common agreement as to what constitutes "pattern for a shirt" vs. "pattern for a skirt"
2016-04-27T20:55:48 <Bosmon> I remember even in the ancient Fluid 2008 summit, trying to talk about how, with software, there is the possibility that "A kit for making X" could be exactly the same thing as "an X"
2016-04-27T20:55:50 <michelled> http://thanksimadethem.blogspot.ca/2014/11/sewing-pattern-mannequin-wall-art.html
2016-04-27T20:56:12 <danayo> nice michelled
2016-04-27T20:56:24 <Bosmon> That is, you can *choose to see* a particular artefact as a kit of its disassembled parts, *or* the thing itself, just depending on your point of view
2016-04-27T20:56:32 <Bosmon> This is naturally not possible in the real world
2016-04-27T20:56:46 <Bosmon> Which is one of the reasons I think people neglect the possibility that it might be possible in software
2016-04-27T20:56:56 <alanharnum> in a similar way you could think about something like "pattern/artifact for an embedded web map component" could have hundreds of incarnations but common agreement (API? agreement programming interface?) as to what would allow it to qualify as a map
2016-04-27T20:57:20 <Bosmon> People naturally ignore possibilities that would seem like "magic" if they occurred in the "real world"

2016-04-27T14:25:32 <Katy> Bosmon cindyli   Trying to make sure we understand the different user roles.  A user can edit his/her own preference.  Is there a person who can be an admin who can delete and edit users.  An then a person who\'s role is like a super admin, who can add/delete an admin
2016-04-27T14:29:26 * Yan_Hu has quit
2016-04-27T14:29:27 <cindyli> Katy: I believe the admin role for managing users is certainly required. In terms of the role level details as well as how to manage admins, discussions and plans are needed.
2016-04-27T14:30:16 <Katy> cindyli  thank you
2016-04-27T14:30:44 <cindyli> no problem, thanks for thinking about this, Katy

2016-04-27T14:43:52 <Katy> cindyli  agree, with you we need to discuss the different user roles for the gpii application.  I was looking at different user management tools and the gpii-express-user. I notice the gpii-express-user did not have roles as a feature.
2016-04-27T14:46:51 <cindyli> Katy: as i understand, you are right that gpii-express-user doesn\'t have roles at the moment. it\'s on the to-do list
2016-04-27T14:46:52 <Katy> cindyli  Also something for us to think about is that we might consider an admin is responsible for a set of users.  Perhaps, a geo graphic area.  I can start a thread in the architecture digest for us to discuss user roles.
2016-04-27T14:47:26 <cindyli> a good idea, Katy

2016-04-27T16:35:11 <clown> jhernandez:  I documented that here:  https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-1739?focusedCommentId=18336&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-18336
2016-04-27T16:35:21 <jhernandez> which reports the main window\'s size in mm, and I think that XDisplayWidthMM/XDisplayHeightMM will do the trick
2016-04-27T16:35:55 <clown> and discovered that XDisplayWidthMM() does exactly what those lines you referenced above do.
2016-04-27T16:36:06 <jhernandez> ok ok
2016-04-27T16:36:40 <clown> it all comes down to accessing the Displays.Screen{screenNumber].mWidth and mHeight.
2016-04-27T16:37:06 <jhernandez> in any case, I tested it and they returned different values (at least here in my laptop)
2016-04-27T16:37:17 <clown> nonetheless, I will try the XDisplayWidthMM() just to check.
2016-04-27T16:37:56 <clown> Right, jhernandez, I tested our Xrandr add-on as is on a Acer tower, and it returned the actual physical size of the monitor I was using.
2016-04-27T16:38:21 <clown> But, the numbers I get for a VM are not quite right.
