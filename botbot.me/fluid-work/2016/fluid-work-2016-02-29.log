2016-02-29T23:46:01 <danayo> yes, I included it
2016-02-29T23:46:04 <Bosmon> "Personae and Use Cases"
2016-02-29T23:46:05 <Bosmon> cool
2016-02-29T23:46:22 <Bosmon> ok, so there\'s only one new section - rather, an expanded section?

2016-02-29T19:45:45 * yzen joined the channel
2016-02-29T19:46:04 <Justin_o> danayo: i think you might want to write up that project idea now
2016-02-29T19:46:34 <danayo> :) that\'s great Justin_o!
2016-02-29T19:47:46 <danayo> game for learning-to-learn, right Justin_o? I don\'t see it on the list - but we can still add new ones?

2016-02-29T19:52:09 <colinclark_> Justin_o: !!!
2016-02-29T19:52:17 <colinclark_> Does this mean we were accepted?
2016-02-29T19:52:21 <Justin_o> danayo: yep we can still add projects
2016-02-29T19:52:40 <Justin_o> colinclark_: i think so.. but i haven\'t gotten the confirmation e-mail yet, so not 100%.
2016-02-29T19:52:49 <colinclark_> Fingers crossed
2016-02-29T19:54:06 <Justin_o> :)

2016-02-29T19:55:40 <Justin_o> Bosmon, danayo, colinclark_: here\'s a project you guys might like http://www.catrobat.org/ Don\'t exactly know what it is, but it sounds interesting.
2016-02-29T19:56:40 <danayo> Catrobat!
2016-02-29T19:58:42 <danayo> which led me to this http://no1leftbehind.eu/
2016-02-29T19:58:55 <danayo> which looks very interesting too Justin_o
2016-02-29T20:01:17 <prastut> Hi Fluid Community. I am Prastut Kumar, a CS sophomore at VIT Chennai wish to contribute to Inclusive Design Institute under GSOC, 2016. I am experienced with Javascript (ExpressJs, Node, Angular (basic)). In my past work, I have contributed in design and technology to "Daemo", a project by Stanford HCI crowdresearch project where I am working as a crowdresearcher. Also contributed to Privly as an open source contributor. Can you help me walkthrough i
2016-02-29T20:01:17 <prastut> n how to go about contributing?

2016-02-29T20:30:44 <colinclark_> Hi prastut, thanks for introducing yourself!
2016-02-29T20:31:12 <colinclark_> In what ways to you envision contributing the the Fluid Project? Were there particular projects you were interested in related to GSoC?
2016-02-29T20:31:26 <colinclark_> We have a list of them here: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Google+Summer+of+Code+2016+with+the+Fluid+Project
2016-02-29T20:35:01 <prastut> I will rank them in terms of interest:
2016-02-29T20:35:06 <prastut> 1. Implement User Interface / Learner Options Responsive Design
2016-02-29T20:35:31 <prastut> I am fairly comfortable with the tech stack provided
2016-02-29T20:36:29 <prastut> 2. JavaScript SoundFont 2 Parser and Synthesizer Engine OR Accessible, Responsive Music UI Controls. Both the project sound very interesting!
2016-02-29T20:37:27 <prastut> colinclark:
2016-02-29T20:38:36 <colinclark_> prastut: I\'d recommend you start by having a look at the wiki and the source code for both of those projects
2016-02-29T20:39:07 <colinclark_> and then consider, as you prepare to apply for projects, how you\'ll tackle them--what your process will be, how you will technically accomplish them, and so on
2016-02-29T20:41:12 <prastut> Thanks Colin! Would the judgement procedure be based only on the proposal? To verse myself with the codebase, I am starting to fix some introductory bugs. Soon PR
2016-02-29T20:41:19 <prastut> *will do a PR.
2016-02-29T20:41:53 <prastut> What\'s the best trajectory according to you? In the meantime will do the recommended.
2016-02-29T20:44:35 * colinclark joined the channel
2016-02-29T20:46:01 <colinclark> That sounds like a reasonable first step, prastut
2016-02-29T20:55:37 <colinclark> simonjb: I love your security section
2016-02-29T20:55:40 <colinclark> my sense is we\'re good
2016-02-29T20:55:46 <colinclark> Bosmon and simonjb, do you think we\'re ready to ship this?
2016-02-29T20:55:54 <simonjb> ok, great colinclark
2016-02-29T20:56:24 <simonjb> looks good to me
2016-02-29T20:56:27 <colinclark> we\'ve probbaly lost jhung for the day, but hopefully it won\'t be much to get this into the template when he gets a chance
2016-02-29T20:56:51 <colinclark> I\'m going to take one more read through it, and then move on to danayo\'s work on the community design methods paper
2016-02-29T20:57:30 <simonjb> colinclark: I read your answers for the face-to-face Nexus questions and they look great
2016-02-29T20:57:38 <colinclark> ok, great
2016-02-29T20:57:43 <simonjb> there\'s still a question about sonification
2016-02-29T20:57:44 <colinclark> we\'re really rolling with the writing these days
2016-02-29T20:57:48 <colinclark> ah oh yes
2016-02-29T20:57:51 <colinclark> let me check that

2016-02-29T21:14:46 <simonjb> Bosmon, colinclark: I\'ve made the pull request for moving Nexus to GPII https://github.com/GPII/nexus/pull/1
2016-02-29T21:15:11 <simonjb> As we discussed on Friday, there\'s some tidy up work to do before it\'s ready to be merged
2016-02-29T21:15:31 <simonjb> I was just looking at the LICENSE and copyright
2016-02-29T21:15:52 <simonjb> I kept the LICENSE that Bosmon had added to the GPII/nexus repo -- (C) GPII
2016-02-29T21:17:10 <Bosmon> Cheers, simonjb
2016-02-29T21:17:14 <Bosmon> I am already working through it :)
2016-02-29T21:17:20 <simonjb> should the individual source file copyright headers also be (C) GPII or OCAD?
2016-02-29T21:18:25 <Justin_o> avtar: have you seen this https://testingbot.com
2016-02-29T21:18:50 <simonjb> colinclark: ^
2016-02-29T21:19:19 <simonjb> thanks Bosmon
2016-02-29T21:19:35 <avtar> Justin_o: no
2016-02-29T21:19:41 <avtar> that\'s interesting
2016-02-29T21:19:53 <avtar> "Our entire service is Hosted in europe. Which means lower latencies for people testing in Europe."
2016-02-29T21:21:05 <avtar> looks like they provide free accounts to open source projects just like saucelabs
2016-02-29T21:21:27 <Justin_o> avtar: yes, i was just going to mention that
2016-02-29T21:21:44 <Justin_o> perhaps we could try them out too, or maybe use both as an option

2016-02-29T23:40:35 <danayo> I had more to say about some than others :)

2016-02-29T23:44:14 <colinclark> And then I\'ll aim for a round of edits?
2016-02-29T23:44:19 <Bosmon> colinclark - sure
2016-02-29T23:44:20 <colinclark> I have to confess I\'m quite far behind
2016-02-29T23:44:25 <Bosmon> Is it reasonably clear where they need to go?
2016-02-29T23:44:48 <colinclark> danayo: ^
2016-02-29T23:44:59 <danayo> it should be Bosmon
2016-02-29T23:45:13 <danayo> it replaces the current list of design tools

2016-02-29T18:35:36 * lliskovoi joined the channel
2016-02-29T18:35:55 <simonjb> jhernandez: for the planned diagram, I think the arrow between prefs server and prefs editors should be in the other direction?
2016-02-29T18:36:09 <jhernandez> yeah, I\'ve already updated it
2016-02-29T18:36:13 <simonjb> cool
2016-02-29T18:36:57 <simonjb> and the arrow head on the current architecture between user listeners and local flow manager?
2016-02-29T18:37:07 <Justin_o> cindyli: do you remember if we have docs for the first discovery prefs server integration
2016-02-29T18:37:20 <simonjb> that\'s pointing to the right, rather than down
2016-02-29T18:37:34 <cindyli> we do, Justin_o, as i rmb. digging...
2016-02-29T18:37:49 <jhernandez> simonjb: yeah, exporting it to PDF right now
2016-02-29T18:38:00 <simonjb> awesome jhernandez
2016-02-29T18:38:57 <cindyli> Justin_o: do you have the link to the official first discovery doc site?

2016-02-29T18:40:47 <Justin_o> cindyli: do you still have that?
2016-02-29T18:42:13 <cindyli> no, Justin_o, looking thru my emails, i kind of rmb anastasia sent out those links in an email
2016-02-29T18:42:22 <Justin_o> oh maybe
2016-02-29T18:47:06 <jhung> Justin_o: http://gpii.github.io/docs-first-discovery/
2016-02-29T18:47:58 <Justin_o> jhung: thanks
2016-02-29T18:48:03 <Justin_o> cindyli, michelled ^^
2016-02-29T18:48:57 <cindyli> cool. thanks, jhung and Justin_o, but i somehow rmb there\'s a more formal site for it. i might be wrong

2016-02-29T18:55:11 <bens01> Justin_o, for that issue where you press h and it only voices  "Your sticky keys choice is OFF" - are you able to replicate this reliably?
2016-02-29T18:55:43 <bens01> Justin_o, i\'m trying ctrl+al+r, then navigate to confirm panel and press h
2016-02-29T18:56:10 <bens01> Justin_o, each time it just rereads the whole panel

2016-02-29T19:32:49 <Justin_o> bens01: ah intersting.. i had just quickly tested that before with Safari.. seems that it is a bug specific with Safari and it seems okay in Chrome.
