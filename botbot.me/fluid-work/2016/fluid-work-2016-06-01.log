2016-06-01T20:56:22 <Bosmon> My pull is updated for that whitespace rule
2016-06-01T20:59:00 <Justin_o> Bosmon: should we be updating all of our repos to use eslint now?

2016-06-01T21:11:37 <colinclark> Bosmon: Just to triple-check, we no longer need to do any deduping of Infusion in the context of GPII, is that correct?

2016-06-01T21:46:52 <Bosmon> colinclark - that's right
2016-06-01T21:47:29 <Bosmon> Once our CI beds down I'll issue a pull against all the projects to eliminate the use of grunt-gpii and revert to the use of standard npm references
2016-06-01T21:47:46 <Bosmon> Although perhaps I should do that sooner, given what an obstruction to CI the current arrangement is
2016-06-01T21:49:54 * michelled has quit
2016-06-01T21:51:34 <colinclark> we've worked around the use of grunt-gpii for now
2016-06-01T21:51:37 * gtirloni has quit
2016-06-01T21:51:40 <colinclark> temporarily
2016-06-01T21:51:49 <colinclark> but whenever you feel like you have time to get rid of it, that would be good
2016-06-01T21:52:08 <colinclark> we stil have a strange problem where the script running npm install seems to fail silently
2016-06-01T21:52:11 <colinclark> which we will keep triaging
2016-06-01T21:52:18 <colinclark> but we've found a viable temporary workaround for that, too
2016-06-01T21:52:29 <colinclark> so at this point, we're at least seeing legitimate errors
2016-06-01T21:52:36 <colinclark> test failures, rather

b'2016-06-01T16:37:10 <gloob> jhernandez: thank you, sir
2016-06-01T16:38:04 <gloob> so tonys research is only focused in client-side components?
2016-06-01T16:38:13 <gloob> the-t-in-rtf: ^
2016-06-01T16:38:33 <the-t-in-rtf> huh?
2016-06-01T16:38:35 <jhernandez> gloob: bitte
2016-06-01T16:38:46 <the-t-in-rtf> which research?
2016-06-01T16:38:49 <the-t-in-rtf> I do lots of it.
2016-06-01T16:39:02 <gloob> the-t-in-rtf: context, Thoughts on the Karma test runner...
2016-06-01T16:39:20 <the-t-in-rtf> Karma can be made to work for client-side and node tests.
2016-06-01T16:39:29 <the-t-in-rtf> Although it is best suited for unit tests only.
2016-06-01T16:39:29 * alanharnum joined the channel
2016-06-01T16:39:35 <gloob> but is it just a test runner for jqunit and likes?
2016-06-01T16:39:48 <the-t-in-rtf> Well, it\'s a test runner, but imposes some heavy restrictions.
2016-06-01T16:39:59 <the-t-in-rtf> For example, it makes it difficult to use your own HTML test fixtures.
2016-06-01T16:40:03 * kasparnet joined the channel
2016-06-01T16:40:04 <gloob> aha
2016-06-01T16:40:53 <the-t-in-rtf> I really want to try intern, but thus far, testem has met the most use cases for the things I need.
2016-06-01T16:40:53 <gloob> so, do you expect that adopting karma will trigger a refactoring of current gpii system implementations?
2016-06-01T16:40:58 <gloob> where system implementation means, linux, windows and mac
2016-06-01T16:41:15 * kasparnet has quit
2016-06-01T16:41:52 * alanharnum joined the channel
2016-06-01T16:42:36 <the-t-in-rtf> I expect that it will be next to impossible to use karma with anything we\'ve done.
2016-06-01T16:42:45 <the-t-in-rtf> who is suggesting that we should use it?
2016-06-01T16:42:55 <gloob> you
2016-06-01T16:42:58 <the-t-in-rtf> nope
2016-06-01T16:43:07 <the-t-in-rtf> I wrote a long note to the arch list, let me find a link.
2016-06-01T16:43:11 <the-t-in-rtf> it showed promise but won\'t work.
2016-06-01T16:43:12 <gloob> well, Antranig Antranig asked about the Karma test runner.
2016-06-01T16:43:15 <gloob> ah o
2016-06-01T16:43:20 <gloob> yes Im reading it just now
2016-06-01T16:43:23 <the-t-in-rtf> yes, I looked at it based on his suggestion.
2016-06-01T16:43:37 <gloob> so testem looks more promising for us, then?
2016-06-01T16:44:25 <the-t-in-rtf> yes, the only other option I think is worth pursuing (that I\'ve seen) is Intern.
2016-06-01T16:44:41 <the-t-in-rtf> that offers the possibility of running better keyboard navigation tests with real browsers.
2016-06-01T16:45:04 <the-t-in-rtf> I looked briefly at nightwatch this week, it doesn\'t seem worth it versus testem.
2016-06-01T16:45:16 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, write client-side tests in QUnit and you will be in good company as we consider options.
2016-06-01T16:45:28 <gloob> ok, great
2016-06-01T16:45:47 <gloob> and If I get crazy and start to write tests with Mocha?
2016-06-01T16:45:51 <gloob> :P
2016-06-01T16:46:38 <the-t-in-rtf> Son, you\'re on your own.
2016-06-01T16:46:38 <the-t-in-rtf> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__n5Bgxx-68
2016-06-01T16:46:45 * alanharnum has quit
2016-06-01T16:47:13 <gloob> just joking, but based on my brief experience with node projects mocha seems more widely used, anyway I don\'t want to create a discussion about it
2016-06-01T16:47:19 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, I know it\'s heavily used, just not sure who else could help you.  You\'d be on your own working through the integration issues that the rest of us are solving together.
2016-06-01T16:47:40 <gloob> sure
2016-06-01T16:47:47 <jhernandez> gloob: you\'d end up sleeping with the fishes
2016-06-01T16:47:49 <jhernandez> xDDD
2016-06-01T16:47:54 <the-t-in-rtf> The real key is finding an environment (like testem) that supports many options.
2016-06-01T16:48:02 <gloob> I see
2016-06-01T16:48:10 <gloob> ok, thanks for explaining Tony the-t-in-rtf
2016-06-01T16:48:11 <the-t-in-rtf> Karma was great with Mocha, for example, but less so for QUnit and standalone HTML tests.
2016-06-01T16:48:24 <the-t-in-rtf> testem is good for mocha *and* QUnit.
2016-06-01T16:48:37 <gloob> should I see the full 12 minutes of Blazing Saddles ?
2016-06-01T16:48:43 <the-t-in-rtf> not necessarily.
2016-06-01T16:48:46 <gloob> it is going to be my first time
2016-06-01T16:48:48 <gloob> should I?
2016-06-01T16:48:52 <gloob> :D
2016-06-01T16:48:58 <the-t-in-rtf> wait and rent it.
2016-06-01T16:49:11 <gloob> ok, noted down

2016-06-01T17:04:30 <wale> thanks man
2016-06-01T17:04:43 <wale> I think something similar last week
2016-06-01T17:05:08 <wale> yup docker scanner feature

2016-06-01T17:05:18 <colinclark> simonjb: should we do gtm for our meeting today?
2016-06-01T17:05:19 <colinclark> since you had problems with skype last time?
2016-06-01T17:05:28 <colinclark> gtirloni: will you join us as well, or are you busy? totally up to you
2016-06-01T17:05:32 <wale> but this is great .. thanks for the headsup
2016-06-01T17:05:47 <wale> oh crap .. sorry I was waiting for the skype call
2016-06-01T17:05:58 <simonjb> yeah, sorry colinclark, I think gtm would be best for me
2016-06-01T17:06:02 <colinclark> ok
2016-06-01T17:06:04 <colinclark> lemme start it
2016-06-01T17:06:09 <simonjb> thanks
2016-06-01T17:06:12 <wale> dial in details ?
2016-06-01T17:06:29 <gtirloni> colinclark: bit busy now juggling a few different things. i may have to run an errand in a few minutes related to the trip (getting things ready)
2016-06-01T17:06:38 <colinclark> no worries!

2016-06-01T17:07:26 <gtirloni> wale: it\'s a bit unclear what Docker security scanner is based on.. where the data comes from. In the case of Red Hat\'s Atomic Scan... it\'s from here: https://www.open-scap.org
2016-06-01T17:07:58 <wale> precisely the question I was asking
2016-06-01T17:08:18 <wale> scap .. security content automation protocol
2016-06-01T17:08:42 <wale> it\'s great .. it actually parses and does the heavy lifting of security event correlation before it hits a centralized SIEM

2016-06-01T20:18:41 <Bosmon> Hi there cindyli1
2016-06-01T20:18:53 <Bosmon> I wonder if, at some point when you had a bit of time, you might look over my linting pull -
2016-06-01T20:18:54 <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/716
2016-06-01T20:19:22 <cindyli1> sure, Bosmon

2016-06-01T20:19:52 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i guess it doesn\'t specifically matter in terms of your pull request, but i was wondering if we wanted to take the time to re-evaluate our syntax rules
2016-06-01T20:20:07 <Justin_o> e.g. 2 vs 4 spaces and etc.
2016-06-01T20:20:21 <Bosmon> Justin_o - doesn\'t sound like a great use of time : P
2016-06-01T20:20:21 <Justin_o> lol
2016-06-01T20:21:27 <Bosmon> Can we really afford the time for lots of bikeshedding when we are facing trying to push out a 2.0 release? : P
2016-06-01T20:21:27 <Justin_o> i don\'t think it\'s a big deal in general, but i sometimes think it\'s another barrier for people coming into our community when most other javascript codebases use 2 spaces and etc.
2016-06-01T20:21:27 <Bosmon> Yes
2016-06-01T20:21:27 <Justin_o> i\'m more thinking about this from a community perspective.
2016-06-01T20:21:27 <Bosmon> Lots of other people use Coffeescript too
2016-06-01T20:21:27 <Justin_o> okay, that\'s true
2016-06-01T20:21:27 <Bosmon> Do you think we should consider switching to that? : P
2016-06-01T20:21:30 <Bosmon> Or perhaps ES6 style
2016-06-01T20:21:35 <Bosmon> Or semicolon-free style
2016-06-01T20:21:38 <Bosmon> It is all the rage these days

2016-06-01T20:23:44 <Bosmon> cindyli - depends on this pull against our "grunt-modulefiles": https://github.com/fluid-project/grunt-modulefiles/pull/6
2016-06-01T20:23:52 <Bosmon> I found I couldn\'t update us to grunt 1.x without updating this module as well
2016-06-01T20:25:50 <Justin_o> Bosmon: does eslint catch the white spaces in functions... that is function () {} vs function(){}
2016-06-01T20:25:56 <Justin_o> i don\'t think our current setup is doing that
2016-06-01T20:26:11 <Justin_o> and found some issues with a recent pull request i was reviewing, but would pass linting
2016-06-01T20:26:48 <Bosmon> Yes, I think we can do it with this rule: http://eslint.org/docs/rules/space-before-function-paren
2016-06-01T20:26:52 <Bosmon> I\'ll add it to my pull
2016-06-01T20:26:57 <Justin_o> Bosmon: cool thanks

2016-06-01T14:53:08 <wale> qq
2016-06-01T14:56:33 <wale> the RFID tags and USB Sticks currently issued for users, who administers it .. looking for details on how we manage the tokens keyed into the devices
2016-06-01T15:09:59 <simonjb> hi wale
2016-06-01T15:10:12 <wale> hello
2016-06-01T15:11:32 <simonjb> that is a good question and I don\'t know the answer -- for APCP, I think it\'s something we have yet to put details on
2016-06-01T15:12:12 <colinclark> simonjb: I guess the general approach is that a physical device gets a random ID stored on it
2016-06-01T15:12:32 <colinclark> and then the user has the ability to revoke them as needed
2016-06-01T15:12:58 <wale> right .. I gathered that much on one of the wiki\'s
2016-06-01T15:13:05 <colinclark> presumably also someone at the admin level could do so as well
2016-06-01T15:13:19 <wale> just don\'t see anything substantiating how it\'s being done
2016-06-01T15:13:42 <wale> ok .. I suppose we\'ll go over it when we talk at 1
2016-06-01T15:14:08 <colinclark> wale: Physical device provisioning hasn\'t been implemented yet
2016-06-01T15:14:17 <wale> got you
2016-06-01T15:14:21 <colinclark> sgithens put together a simple prototype for the LGS recently
2016-06-01T15:14:33 <colinclark> based on the random IDs generated by the First Discovery Tool
2016-06-01T15:14:39 <colinclark> but it\'s just a sketch
2016-06-01T15:14:52 <colinclark> are there implementation approaches we should consider?
2016-06-01T15:15:55 <wale> yes .. exploring a couple, assuming you haven\'t already considered any
2016-06-01T15:16:41 <wale> HOTP HMAC-based one-time password (OTP) algorithm for one
2016-06-01T15:17:21 <wale> used within the context of Open Authentication (OATH)
2016-06-01T15:18:11 <colinclark> looking forward to hearing more about it
2016-06-01T15:18:12 <wale> yubico and several others used this framework

2016-06-01T15:46:58 <colinclark> avtar: My impression is that, for the short term we should write a custom build-in-vagrant script that works around the symlink issue that grunt-gpii is susceptible to

2016-06-01T15:54:41 <avtar> colinclark: i believe this https://github.com/GPII/grunt-gpii/blob/master/tasks/gpii.js#L97-L116 is all that needs to be done
2016-06-01T15:54:48 <Justin_o> cindyli: alanharnum: it sounded like from standup that you are both working on something similar.. pouch and couch datasources. I wonder if you can come up with a common implementation that could be shared ( at least as a base grade ) between the two
2016-06-01T15:55:01 <colinclark> yup, exactly, avtar
2016-06-01T15:55:38 <avtar> i guess there\'s no point in verifying the ci server job then
2016-06-01T15:55:49 <Justin_o> cindyli, alanharnum: we also had some work on a pouch datasource in the metadata work https://github.com/fluid-project/metadata/blob/master/src/components/pouchDBDataSource/js/pouchDBDataSource.js
2016-06-01T15:55:50 <cindyli> a good idea, Justin_o
2016-06-01T15:55:51 <colinclark> i think i wouldn\'t worry about it
2016-06-01T15:55:54 <avtar> ok
2016-06-01T15:56:02 <colinclark> if we can get the build to pass in both places, we\'ll be in better shape anyway
2016-06-01T15:56:06 <alanharnum> Justin_o cindyli: I think that would be a good idea. I\'m using Pouch in a pretty simplistic way right now & haven\'t really looked at what prior art we have.
2016-06-01T15:57:44 <cindyli> alanharnum: we probably should check in a bit on what we are trying to achieve with pouch and couch.
2016-06-01T15:57:49 <cindyli> probably after the arch meeting
2016-06-01T15:59:21 <alanharnum> it might make the most sense to extend the existing fluid.prefs.store / fluid.prefs/dataSource grades
2016-06-01T15:59:53 <alanharnum> here\'s a TODO line from Store.js: "unify with Kettle\'s and ultimately Infusion\'s dataSource"
2016-06-01T16:01:42 <alanharnum> the main thing I\'d like to achieve is what I envision the journal implementation looks like - a persistent store that can be either local-only or in the cloud
2016-06-01T16:01:43 <Justin_o> alanharnum, cindyli: this PR is out of date now, but it has the start of a dataSource grade https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/566
2016-06-01T16:02:43 <alanharnum> Pouch seems a way of handling that.
2016-06-01T16:02:56 <alanharnum> and we already use it + Couch in other areas of GPII, etc

2016-06-01T16:34:31 <gloob> is it fine if I follow current unit testing as done in gpii-linux and gpii-windows?

2016-06-01T16:35:26 <cindyli> alanharnum: i\'m using couchdb for the data persistence but using pouchdb to write unit tests and probably acceptance tests as well
2016-06-01T16:36:30 <gloob> they are using node-jqunit
2016-06-01T16:36:32 <cindyli> i wonder if kettle.dataSource.couchDB is the ultimate one for the couchdb. would be nice to have one for pouch too
2016-06-01T16:36:35 <gloob> is that the way to go?
2016-06-01T16:36:43 <jhernandez> gloob: yes
