2016-06-27T18:06:24 <bens__> colinclark, Bosmon, i've stumbled on a few things about how windows reports if sticky keys, contrast, etc, are available. I think a quick note about them would be useful for device reporter development. Is there a preferred way to save these notes? My initial thoughts are adding comments to https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-414 would be good
2016-06-27T18:06:46 <colinclark> yup, commenting on the JIRA seems as good way as any

2016-06-27T22:12:15 <colinclark> no more jshint errors and I ran the testem tests to confirm that I'm getting green bars on OS X with Chrome, Safari, and Firefox

2016-06-27T11:47:12 <Dinuka> I went though the examples in the other components...... but, still I don\'t have a clear idea
2016-06-27T11:47:47 <Dinuka> one question I have is, should we manually develop the tooltip ui
2016-06-27T11:48:43 <Dinuka> or is it generated automatically

2016-06-27T13:34:43 <styki> Hello, Bosmon2. I have a questions about the framework. I am trying to add a gradeName to a component based on the size of the screen, but it has to also be able to switch between the 2 option whenever the screen is resized.
2016-06-27T13:34:51 <cindyli> hi Bosmon2, styki is our GSoC student working on mobile UIO project
2016-06-27T13:35:11 <gtirloni> avtar, colinclark and others: hi! please check if this is reasonable -- https://github.com/GPII/ci-service/pull/11
2016-06-27T13:35:40 <styki> I have an implementation with contextAwareness, but this check is triggered only when the component is being build.
2016-06-27T13:35:52 <Bosmon2> Hi there styki - yes, you will have to destroy and regenerate the component
2016-06-27T13:36:02 <Bosmon2> The cleanest way to do this is to give the component a "createOnEvent" annotation
2016-06-27T13:36:04 * Bosmon2 is now known as Bosmon
2016-06-27T13:36:50 <styki> Bosmon: Is there a build in function to easily add and remove gradeNames?
2016-06-27T13:37:53 <cindyli> Bosmon: the context of this problem is that, we have a different text size panel design for the mobile
2016-06-27T13:38:06 <Bosmon> styki - once components are created, they are immutable
2016-06-27T13:38:23 <Bosmon> What you can do is use the contextAwareness features to broadcast the changed grade based on creating and destroying a context name
2016-06-27T13:38:52 <Bosmon> cindyli - can you help out styki on this based on alanharnum\'s work on contextAwareness, etc?
2016-06-27T13:39:42 <cindyli> Bosmon: trying to clarify the problem. i don\'t have a very good solution for it, so styki and i are seeking ur advice
2016-06-27T13:40:17 <cindyli> Bosmon: basically, the text size panel needs to switch in btw 2 templates at the resizing of the browser window
2016-06-27T13:40:40 <cindyli> however, the prefs framework currently supports one template per panel
2016-06-27T13:40:42 <styki> Bosmon: I have looked at alanharnum\'s work and I think that the major difference is that in my case the state of the window can change at runtime.

2016-06-27T13:41:34 <Bosmon> cindyli - right now our workflow for adaptation takes the following form - i) add or remove checks by means of fluid.contextAware.makeChecks, ii) recreate the component by firing an appropriate event
2016-06-27T13:41:35 <Bosmon> http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/ContextAwareness.html
2016-06-27T13:41:54 <cindyli> Bosmon: that means, when using a desktop and resizing a browser window, when the size is down to 600px width, the text size panel needs to be re-rendered with a different template
2016-06-27T13:42:21 <Bosmon> cindyli - here is an example featuring live adaptation based on this pattern:
2016-06-27T13:42:22 <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-studios/infusion-onward-video-example/blob/master/src/js/australian.js
2016-06-27T13:42:30 <Bosmon> At this end we set up the "adaptation" structure
2016-06-27T13:42:58 <Bosmon> And at this end we trigger makeChecks/forgetChecks in a dynamic, model-based way
2016-06-27T13:42:59 <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-studios/infusion-onward-video-example/blob/master/src/js/onward.js#L13
2016-06-27T13:43:37 <Bosmon> If you are interested you can see the application running live here :)
2016-06-27T13:43:38 <Bosmon> https://fluid-studios.github.io/infusion-onward-video-example/
2016-06-27T13:46:04 <cindyli> oh, it\'s VERY cool
2016-06-27T13:46:30 <cindyli> and the video itself as well ;)
2016-06-27T13:46:45 <styki> thanks Bosmon I will have a look

2016-06-27T15:41:00 <bens__> hi there colinclark, Bosmon, perhaps gtirloni_ and avtar, i\'m running "vagrant up" so I can run the windows unit/acceptance tests on to investigate SPI and 32/64-bit issues. This is my first time so i\'m downloading the 8GB windows 10 image. Any idea if that image is going to be cached locally on my machine? I think i\'m going to be destroying the vagrant box and recreating it many times in the near future and i\'m wondering if that will require a
2016-06-27T15:41:00 <bens__> 8gb download each time
2016-06-27T15:41:22 <colinclark> bens__: It\'ll be cached, yes
2016-06-27T15:41:34 <colinclark> You only need to download the VM once
2016-06-27T15:41:42 <colinclark> at least until it\'s updated with a new version, which we do periodically
2016-06-27T15:41:48 <colinclark> but we try not to do so too often
2016-06-27T15:42:55 <bens__> colinclark, thank you! that is good news because my download ETA is 2.5 hours here
2016-06-27T15:43:01 <colinclark> yeah
2016-06-27T15:43:15 <colinclark> it\'s not fun the first time you run it

2016-06-27T15:48:36 <avtar> at that point you\'ll have to download a new vm :/
2016-06-27T15:48:46 <avtar> *new vm image
2016-06-27T15:49:11 <bens__> avtar, ah thanks.. something i\'ll schedule for overnight :)
2016-06-27T15:50:04 <avtar> yes, i usually do that as well
2016-06-27T15:51:13 <avtar> the image you\'re currently downloading was built and released a month ago https://atlas.hashicorp.com/inclusivedesign/boxes/windows10-eval so you should be able to use it for another 60 days
