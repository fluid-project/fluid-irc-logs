b'2016-01-11T20:05:51 <zamcnema> Justin_o: I have a meeting 3 - x today. Do you think this is going to complicate the process of hooking up the enactors as well? Maybe It would be better to have it as a subcomponent just so its more like the example that I have access to? Let me know what your opinion is of how I should proceed.
2016-01-11T20:07:15 <Justin_o> zamcnema: it\'s probably going to be more straightforwards if it\'s like the existing example
2016-01-11T20:10:42 <zamcnema> Justin_o: XD I had a feeling. Okay, I will get back in there and see what I can do when I get out of the meeting. Thanks Justin.
2016-01-11T20:15:41 <Justin_o> zamcnema: cool, and if you\'re switching it to be the subcomponent of the prefsEditor you might be able to just set "fluid.prefs.fullPreview" in the "gpii.firstDiscovery.firstDiscoveryEditor" gradeNames option and be done.
2016-01-11T20:16:42 <Justin_o> but you should be careful about changes you make to "gpii.firstDiscovery.firstDiscoveryEditor" as it will affect all instance, that is all the demos.. you probably really just want to make a new grade that uses "gpii.firstDiscovery.firstDiscoveryEditor" as a sub grade i.e. as a gradeName

2016-01-11T20:42:43 <Justin_o> jhung: i\'m looking over the descriptions here https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/PhET+John+Travoltage+Simulation+Design
2016-01-11T20:44:13 <Justin_o> so am i correct in assuming there are only 3 triggers to update the description. 1) foot moves 2) hand moves 3) electrons discharge
2016-01-11T20:45:06 <jhung> yes Justin_o. I can\'t think of anything else.
2016-01-11T20:45:22 <Justin_o> i\'m wondering if we can distill this down to 3 paragraphs structured as a) last action b) summary of other items
2016-01-11T20:45:50 <Justin_o> e.g. hand moved and further from the door, his foot is off the floor, he has some negative charges gained
2016-01-11T20:46:33 <Justin_o> something like that but with better writing
2016-01-11T20:46:36 <Justin_o> what do you think?
2016-01-11T20:46:45 <Justin_o> jhung: ^
2016-01-11T20:48:50 <jhung> Justin_o: So you\'re thinking of 3 paragraphs. One for the hand, foot, and charges respectively. Each paragraph describes the previous state, what happened, and then the current state?
2016-01-11T20:49:12 <Justin_o> jhung: want to do a quick vidyo call?
2016-01-11T20:49:22 <jhung> sure Justin_o
2016-01-11T20:49:31 <Justin_o> jhung: okay, call me when you\'re ready

2016-01-11T17:56:54 <jhung> Justin_o: it works well with keyboard. I see you decided to make charges accumulate when going Home and End?
2016-01-11T17:57:12 <Justin_o> jhung: for the foot
2016-01-11T17:57:53 <Justin_o> jhung: we could change that if you think it'll be more consistent with the hand. I think it might be nice to have a quick way to build up the charges though. But either is fine

2016-01-11T19:05:54 <zamcnema> Justin_o:  I'm trying run the templateUrl through another init function similar to what you linked me, but I'm getting held up again on the context of how infusion works again. I think the issue is that my demo.iniWithPreview function that contains the preview options for the templateUrl is trying to over writing the preview component instead of appending it.

2016-01-11T19:20:24 <zamcnema> https://github.com/zamcnema/first-discovery-previewpane/blob/master/node_modules/gpii-first-discovery/demos/js/demos.js

2016-01-11T19:23:55 <zamcnema> Justin_o: How do you highlight in github so that the link starts there?
2016-01-11T19:24:22 <Justin_o> zamcnema: you can click on the line number
2016-01-11T19:24:40 <Justin_o> you can also select a range of lines by shift clicking on the end line
2016-01-11T19:25:20 <zamcnema> Justin_o: want me to resend with the highlighting?
2016-01-11T19:25:48 <Justin_o> zamcnema: sure if you don't mind
2016-01-11T19:26:19 <zamcnema> Justin_o: https://github.com/zamcnema/first-discovery-previewpane/blob/master/node_modules/gpii-first-discovery/src/js/firstDiscoveryEditor.js#L127-L137

2016-01-11T19:29:50 <Justin_o> zamcnema: okay, yes, sorry to say but that's not going to work.
2016-01-11T19:31:14 <Justin_o> zamcnema: so what you are actually doing is creating two preview components running on the same markup
2016-01-11T19:31:44 <Justin_o> zamcnema: what you really need to do is update the configuration as it is being called through this init function https://github.com/zamcnema/first-discovery-previewpane/blob/master/node_modules/gpii-first-discovery/demos/index.html#L198

2016-01-11T19:32:43 <Justin_o> but let me check something out first
2016-01-11T19:34:25 <zamcnema> Justin_o: I tried using that init function orginially, but theres a good chance that I could have had something set up incorrectly.
2016-01-11T19:43:28 <zamcnema> Justin_o: I just messed with it a little more and put the options with the listener and the template into the init function. and removed it from the firstDiscoveryEditor. I got the bad request thing again, so that means that when I do that it doesn't overright the url from the fluid preview grade
2016-01-11T19:47:52 <bens__> alanharnum, gtirloni, avtar (and others): any pointers on how to read a port number from an environment variable in a kettle config file like here: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/configs/cloudBased.development.all.local.json#L10
2016-01-11T19:50:05 <alanharnum> bens__: not sure unfortunately - i don't know a great deal about kettle's internals.
2016-01-11T19:50:28 <alanharnum> sounds like something Bosmon could handily answer if he's here
2016-01-11T19:51:00 <gtirloni> or Justin_o .. he's been doing some work on that front
2016-01-11T19:51:18 <Justin_o> zamcnema: unfortunately this is going to be a bit more complicated because the preview is a sibling of the prefsEditor instead of a child of it
2016-01-11T19:52:16 <Bosmon> bens__, alanharnum - unfortunately Justin_o 's work hasn't been integrated with Kettle trunk yet, and the version of Kettle we are bound against in GPII universal trunk is even older (c. 2 years old)
2016-01-11T19:52:48 <Justin_o> zamcnema: we could have done something like https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/tests/manual-tests/framework/preferences/fullPage-schema/index.html#L69-L75
2016-01-11T19:53:13 <bens__> Bosmon, are you talking about this gpii.resolvers.enc by Justin_o on first discovery server? https://github.com/GPII/first-discovery-server/blob/master/src/js/configUtils.js#L21-L32
2016-01-11T19:53:21 <Bosmon> bens__ - exactly
2016-01-11T19:53:39 <Bosmon> Unfortunately we are working here with various codebases of various different ages
2016-01-11T19:53:54 <gtirloni> we've resorted to templating the config files, in whatever config mgmt solution is being used
2016-01-11T19:53:56 <Bosmon> I have an upcoming branch which will bring everything up to sync but it is still waiting on a review process
2016-01-11T19:54:30 <Bosmon> So for working with GPII's trunk, more primitive schemes are necessary for dealing with configuration
2016-01-11T19:54:39 <Bosmon> gtirloni 's suggestion represents the current state of the art for that
2016-01-11T19:55:07 <bens__> is this actually a kettle issue or an infusion one (access to env variables at runtime) ? I would think infusion
2016-01-11T19:55:11 * the-t-in-rtf has quit
2016-01-11T19:55:28 <Bosmon> bens__ - it requires updates to both Kettle and Infusion - as well as Justin_o 's work specifically
2016-01-11T19:55:56 <Bosmon> The first discovery server, being a standalong project, is working with the latest versions of all of these projects
2016-01-11T19:56:01 * the-t-in-rtf joined the channel
2016-01-11T19:56:13 <gtirloni> bens__: some early work before we adopted Ansible for almost everything: https://github.com/gpii-ops/docker-preferences-server/commit/5c7d45c8483e0c36f449cc43bc0d6850c14ccf19
2016-01-11T19:56:30 <Bosmon> The GPII core itself is much larger and has very much greater inertia - and is currently being used for our EU demo this week for the final review for the Cloud4All project which is just concluding after 4 years
2016-01-11T19:56:48 <Bosmon> After that is out of the way, there will be resources to make the corresponding updates to GPII core
2016-01-11T19:57:28 <Justin_o> zamcnema: but there are no direct paths like this into something that is a sibling of the prefsEditor.. what we'll have to do instead is to create a new grade that informs the preview of the correct url, add that to a new auxiliary schema as an additional loaderGrades, and attach that as an extra gradeName here
2016-01-11T19:57:28 <Justin_o> https://github.com/zamcnema/first-discovery-previewpane/blob/master/node_modules/gpii-first-discovery/demos/js/demos.js#L25.
2016-01-11T19:59:05 <bens__> i see. a little background on why i'm asking.. i am trying to run the authorization server on bluemix as a PaaS application. The problem is that the port is not known until runtime and is provided as the VCAP_PORT environment variable
2016-01-11T20:00:55 <bens__> Bosmon, gtirloni, alanharnum: i'll try following the standalone preferences server approach.. I can control the ports ahead of time that way
2016-01-11T20:01:06 * anastasiac has quit
2016-01-11T20:04:41 * anastasiac joined the channel
2016-01-11T20:05:09 <Justin_o> zamcnema: okay, was just talking things over with Bosmon a bit and there may be a simpler solution after all.. you'd just need to fix up the current init function a bit so that it could properly take options and define a new options distribution
