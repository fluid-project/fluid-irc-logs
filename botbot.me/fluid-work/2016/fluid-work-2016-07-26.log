2016-07-26T16:04:05 <danayo> PaliwalSparsh1, Justin_o shall we meet?
2016-07-26T16:04:09 <danayo> https://conf.inclusivedesign.ca/flex.html?roomdirect.html&key=xemU59x8DtnO41eCMtCpCioWaRI
2016-07-26T16:04:21 <PaliwalSparsh1> sure thanks danayo
2016-07-26T16:07:33 <PaliwalSparsh1> Justin_o do you know how to overpass vidyo web and open in normal vidyo client. I am being directed to vidyoweb again and again and it feels really slow.
2016-07-26T16:08:41 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh1: hmm.. i\'m not sure.. maybe alanharnum or avtar might know
2016-07-26T16:08:50 <Justin_o> or gtirloni
2016-07-26T16:09:47 <gtirloni> PaliwalSparsh1: not sure how to do that. you could open vidyodesktop and join the room directly (look for it in the contact list)
2016-07-26T16:10:01 <gtirloni> or you can uninstall the vidyoweb extension
2016-07-26T16:10:52 <alanharnum> what gtirloni said I think - use the Vidyo client directly & join the room. that link will activate the VidyoWeb extension
2016-07-26T16:11:32 <PaliwalSparsh1> I have the vidyo Desktop open still forcing me to do the vidyoweb extension thing
2016-07-26T16:12:29 <avtar> PaliwalSparsh1: are you getting prompted to use the web extension even after uninstalling it?
2016-07-26T16:13:41 <PaliwalSparsh1> avtar i deleted then on the link it says VidyoWeb extension is required to continue
2016-07-26T16:13:58 <PaliwalSparsh1> It started to happen from the last week
2016-07-26T16:14:15 <PaliwalSparsh1> web worked for me last week this time it is stuck on welcome screen

2016-07-26T18:23:01 <gloob> Bosmon: hello, sir
2016-07-26T18:24:08 <gloob> Bosmon: so I was thinking to commit a patch for https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-1873 just checking empty string in the affected method
2016-07-26T18:24:30 <Bosmon> Yes
2016-07-26T18:24:37 <Bosmon> It\'s reasonable, so long as it is done very carefully
2016-07-26T18:24:53 <gloob> I think it won\'t collide with future work from stegru around GPII-481
2016-07-26T18:25:22 <Bosmon> Yes, I think that\'s right
2016-07-26T18:25:26 <gloob> Bosmon: I think I know exactly how to handle it, so we will have green in our tests and time for a more correct approach
2016-07-26T18:25:30 <gloob> Bosmon: ok, great
2016-07-26T18:25:41 <Bosmon> stegru will resolve GPII-481 via GPII-581
2016-07-26T18:25:46 <gloob> I read it
2016-07-26T18:26:09 <Bosmon> gloob - try to put the check in a self-contained method, which is named after the issue number
2016-07-26T18:26:17 <Bosmon> And add lots of explanation
2016-07-26T18:26:31 <gloob> yes, I think comments are more important that code in this case
2016-07-26T18:26:39 <gloob> s/that/than
2016-07-26T18:27:03 <gloob> GPII581_dirty_hack() you mean?
2016-07-26T18:27:21 <Bosmon> A little like that, yes :)
2016-07-26T18:27:22 <gloob> :)
2016-07-26T18:27:50 <gloob> makes sense, thanks!

2016-07-26T12:08:51 <Bosmon> kasparnet - DE LA ................... **NITTT**!!!
2016-07-26T12:09:49 <kasparnet> L\'Antvarnique de l\'Angleterre
2016-07-26T12:10:17 <kasparnet> how are things? Have the awful sun stopped shining in england, or are you still suffering?
2016-07-26T12:10:40 <kasparnet> I was just reviewing Waynes pull request: https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/377
2016-07-26T12:11:03 <kasparnet> and it brought up two things in the framework that could be nice and useful
2016-07-26T12:11:15 <kasparnet> and I wanted your opinion on whether they\'re worth implementing
2016-07-26T12:11:34 <kasparnet> the first one is a transform function that simply outputs the same value to multiple output paths
2016-07-26T12:12:01 <kasparnet> as you can see, the transformations are quite akward in that one common term affects multiple jaws settings the same way
2016-07-26T12:12:21 <kasparnet> so wrapping things in a transform that will output it\'s input value to multiple locations would be useful
2016-07-26T12:12:48 <kasparnet> (think we discussed this before and had some reservations toward it, but I dont remember what they were)
2016-07-26T12:13:34 <kasparnet> (2) Second thing, is that one manually has to either do a couple of graphical (manual) steps after install, OR create two empty files on the file-system before JAWS can work with the GPII
2016-07-26T12:14:40 <kasparnet> Since we could actually do the second option (create two files) using the framework, I was wondering if this would be a good occasion to implement the "isConfigurable" and "makeConfigurable" options of a solutions registry entry. This would be helpful for the CI work as well, afaik
2016-07-26T12:14:43 <kasparnet> Bosmon: ^
2016-07-26T12:18:18 <Bosmon> The sun has stopped a bit now
2016-07-26T12:18:45 * Justin_o joined the channel
2016-07-26T12:18:52 <Bosmon> 1) I think we will not further abuse our model transform dialect to allow it to output to multiple paths
2016-07-26T12:19:18 <Bosmon> I think instead we will proceed with our plan to fragment giant model transform documents into "lightweight component trees"
2016-07-26T12:19:45 <Bosmon> 2) Yes, isConfigurable and makeConfigurable sound like a good plan
2016-07-26T12:24:40 <kasparnet> Bosmon: cool - that makes sense

2016-07-26T13:30:55 <dinuka> I think thats better
2016-07-26T13:31:30 <dinuka> now I have put milstones for our controllers and added issues for them as tasks
2016-07-26T13:32:05 <dinuka> By the way.....  For sharing designs, we can either use github issues or invision
2016-07-26T13:32:32 <dinuka> But, since my invision app is a trial
2016-07-26T13:32:45 <dinuka> I wan\'t be able to use it further
2016-07-26T13:33:14 <dinuka> sepidehshahi do you know any other free too
2016-07-26T13:33:18 <michelled> hi dinuka, I put a few links to your project on the fluid-wiki. Can you please update them if they are no longer valid? https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Google+Summer+of+Code+%28GSoC%29+2016+Project+Progress+Repository

2016-07-26T13:34:18 <dinuka> yes....I have developed one more controoler

2016-07-26T13:42:01 <PaliwalSparsh> Justin_o I am using textToSpeech fluid component in the game. I was making the menu to mute the voice over, but i am not able to figure out how to make volume to 0.
2016-07-26T13:42:02 <PaliwalSparsh> http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/TextToSpeechAPI.html#volume
2016-07-26T13:44:12 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: what happens when it is set to 0?

2016-07-26T13:44:36 <PaliwalSparsh> This is how i use the speechComp
2016-07-26T13:44:58 * yzen joined the channel
2016-07-26T13:45:35 <PaliwalSparsh> When i do console.log(speechComp.volume) it says undefined or console.log(speechComp.utteranceOpts.volume) it says volume not found.
2016-07-26T13:45:55 <alanharnum> PaliwalSparsh Justin_o: I think the issue may be those docs are not accurate for the current version
2016-07-26T13:46:04 <alanharnum> i was just running into this on the weekend with a personal project
2016-07-26T13:46:08 * danayo joined the channel
2016-07-26T13:46:40 <alanharnum> the docs appear to say you need to set utteranceOpts on the component, but they actually need to be part of the model path in the current version
2016-07-26T13:47:00 <PaliwalSparsh> alanharnum I am using v2.5.0
2016-07-26T13:48:55 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: so alanharnum is right https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/components/textToSpeech/js/TextToSpeech.js#L78-L91
2016-07-26T13:49:04 <Justin_o> it\'s in the model not as a direct option
2016-07-26T13:49:39 <alanharnum> what I ended up having to do (and I\'m not sure this was the best approach) was apply the changes I wanted to the model before calling fluid.textToSpeech.queueSpeech
2016-07-26T13:50:02 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: however if you are setting the volume on an individual queued speech, you can pass in a volume option to override a specific instance. https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/components/textToSpeech/js/TextToSpeech.js#L196

2016-07-26T13:50:29 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: however, in your case you\'ll probably want to make a global change to the model as alanharnum mentioned above
2016-07-26T13:50:56 <PaliwalSparsh> Justin_o yes  that is what i aim to achieve to make the change globally.

2016-07-26T13:52:33 <Justin_o> alanharnum: did you file a JIRA for the docs being out of date?

2016-07-26T13:53:06 <alanharnum> i\'m using it for a personal project so I\'ve worked with it recently
2016-07-26T13:53:35 <alanharnum> i ran into it as well with Chart Authoring but at the time I wasn\'t sure if I was just using Infusion wrong, but now I\'m confident enough to say the docs are out of date :P
2016-07-26T13:53:49 <Justin_o> alanharnum: :)
