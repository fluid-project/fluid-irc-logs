b'2016-08-11T17:04:08 <Bosmon> But I think this function needs to be refactored anyway
2016-08-11T17:06:34 <cindyli> Bosmon: ah, u mean the promise was returned earlier before the promiseTogo was reassigned
2016-08-11T17:06:42 <cindyli> that makes sense
2016-08-11T17:07:08 <michelled> jhernandez: what are you doing to work around https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5940
2016-08-11T17:07:10 <Bosmon> cindyli - well, not "before", but you have some problematic flow paths where some use can be made of the original promise which is then thrown away
2016-08-11T17:08:33 <cindyli> ok, let me see how to refactor this function, Bosmon. let me know if you have suggestions
2016-08-11T17:09:02 <Bosmon> cindyli - our standard best practices apply
2016-08-11T17:09:14 <Bosmon> Try not to write extensive code inside callbacks, and certainly not doubly nested
2016-08-11T17:09:43 <cindyli> nesting sometimes is a bit hard to get around
2016-08-11T17:09:55 <Bosmon> nonsense :)
2016-08-11T17:10:22 <cindyli> objection :)
2016-08-11T17:11:06 <Bosmon> People always say stuff like that when they are starting to work with a new idiom or domain...

2016-08-11T17:11:22 <Bosmon> All of a sudden everything they learned about structuring code seems to go out of the window : P
2016-08-11T17:11:38 <cindyli> certainly true
2016-08-11T17:11:55 <Bosmon> If only someone had been around to blame me when I was constructing the IoC testing framework
2016-08-11T17:11:59 <cindyli> i\'m surely still in the learning zone of async promises
2016-08-11T17:12:20 <Bosmon> Don\'t be afraid to make i) new utilities, ii) new invokers/functions or workflow points
2016-08-11T17:12:50 <Bosmon> For example "// Create a new token if one doesn\'t exist" is clearly a separate function
2016-08-11T17:13:27 <cindyli> right
2016-08-11T17:14:03 <Bosmon> And on line 541 you should make sure the array-style access happens somewhere where it doesn\'t interfere with the control flow
2016-08-11T17:14:24 <Bosmon> That is, once you\'ve got the responses, unpack them into straighforward arguments and then dispatch them to an ordinary function
2016-08-11T17:15:14 <cindyli> ok, will try that

2016-08-11T18:11:54 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: i wonder if this would be easier as a spread sheet with a column for each language that you wanted translations for.
2016-08-11T18:13:27 <PaliwalSparsh> Justin_o: Sounds like a good idea I will try making a spreadsheet. So you are imagining with first row for en and then three rows for other language then second sentence and so on

2016-08-11T18:14:30 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: i\'m thinking a column for each language. So each row would correspond to a string you wanted translated
2016-08-11T18:15:27 <PaliwalSparsh> Cool just would be very big horizontally, anyways hardly matters.
2016-08-11T18:15:46 <PaliwalSparsh> Thanks for the suggestion.

2016-08-11T21:16:14 <jhernandez> you can workaround https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5940 in many ways
2016-08-11T21:16:28 <michelled> jhernandez: Bosmon asked me to fix it :)
2016-08-11T21:16:34 <michelled> so I\'ll just do that ;)
2016-08-11T21:16:40 <michelled> where are you going jhernandez?
2016-08-11T21:16:43 <jhernandez> nice!
2016-08-11T21:17:02 <jhernandez> I\'m going to Spain, but will spend a week or so in south of Franceee
2016-08-11T21:17:52 <jhernandez> next to montpellier, then, we\'ll cross to Spain and will spend a few days in Pyrenees
2016-08-11T21:18:05 <jhernandez> looking forward to it!
2016-08-11T21:19:49 <michelled> sounds amazing!
2016-08-11T21:20:00 <michelled> have a wonderful time!
2016-08-11T21:20:20 <jhernandez> thanks, will do!! ;)
2016-08-11T21:24:55 <jhernandez> btw, first thing I did to workaround the issue was moving my work folder outside of the filesystem root, but later on I decided to just add an extra check in https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/module/fluid.js#L39
2016-08-11T21:26:56 <jhernandez> the check is about to find out whether we are the found upInfusionPath
2016-08-11T21:27:50 <jhernandez> not sure if it\'s the best way to fix it, but it worked for me
2016-08-11T21:28:34 <jhernandez> I can push it if you want to take a look at it

2016-08-11T21:50:41 <jhernandez> as I said, I\'m not sure whether is the best way to fix it - didn\'t run the tests nor perform more testing, it just works for me

2016-08-11T15:47:46 <michelled> who\'s reviewing that?

2016-08-11T15:50:12 <kavyak> Hi Antranig..
2016-08-11T15:52:08 <Bosmon> Hi there kavyak
2016-08-11T15:52:16 <Bosmon> michelled - simonjb and colinclark said they would do it between them
2016-08-11T15:52:25 <michelled> ah, right, thx
2016-08-11T15:53:44 <TPark> danayo: hi dana, this is the link to the comments for the ILDH: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xsxgLkZchwKXZak9e8mKSMVQv2uFXbmnE8vp5TUOoEU/edit?usp=sharing
2016-08-11T15:54:16 <kavyak> Can you please help me understand get and set process in settings handler
2016-08-11T15:54:43 * clown has quit
2016-08-11T15:55:09 <Bosmon> Hi kavyak - here\'s our existing docs on settings handlers
2016-08-11T15:55:11 <Bosmon> https://wiki.gpii.net/w/Settings_Handler
2016-08-11T15:55:29 <Bosmon> The "get" process is used to read from the settings handler, and "set" to write to it
2016-08-11T15:56:02 <Bosmon> But the "set" process has an additional effect in reading the current settings back before they are overwritten, in theory in a transactionally safe way, although in practice we don\'t have such transactions yet
2016-08-11T15:56:26 <Bosmon> But because the "set" process also performs a read, we have so far got by without using the "get" process in our main architecture, although it is widely used in test cases

2016-08-11T16:32:53 <alanharnum> actually never mind
2016-08-11T16:32:57 <alanharnum> it appears that i have that power
2016-08-11T16:34:38 * clown joined the channel
2016-08-11T16:34:46 <Justin_o> alanharnum: in the fluid-project space?
2016-08-11T16:34:58 <alanharnum> yeah, but i actually have that power it appears

2016-08-11T16:43:09 <cindyli> Bosmon: wonder if you can help me with the issue i\'m running into with this code - https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/GPII-1274/gpii/node_modules/gpii-oauth2/gpii-oauth2-authz-server/src/AuthorizationService.js#L559, what I wanna do is to replace line 565-570 with line 559-563 using fluid.promise.map()
2016-08-11T16:43:23 * colinclark joined the channel
2016-08-11T16:44:48 <cindyli> the issue is that,  the "promiseTogo" assigned at line 563 is returned to the caller function. but the success callback on that promise never gets called
2016-08-11T16:45:08 <cindyli> just like the resolve() never happens in this promiseTogo
2016-08-11T16:46:20 <cindyli> fluid.promise.map() is used in various places in this file and all working fine except this one. the special part with this is fluid.promise.map() is used in a callback at resolving a promise returned by fluid.promise.sequence()
2016-08-11T16:47:14 <cindyli> so i wrote a unit test mimicing the same situation of having map() called in sequence() callback - https://gist.github.com/cindyli/0309896add30cb2610e9b1edba537d9a
2016-08-11T16:47:24 * colinclark has quit
2016-08-11T16:47:26 <cindyli> everything passes. seems this is not the cause
2016-08-11T16:48:49 <cindyli> so i wonder if you can see mistakes I made in this usage?

2016-08-11T16:53:09 <Justin_o> alanharnum: i\'m a bit surprised that you were able to do that, i was looking at the team configuration in github and I didn\'t think it would be possible.
2016-08-11T16:53:18 <Justin_o> alanharnum: are you able to push changes to it as well?
2016-08-11T16:55:59 <alanharnum> Justin_o: not sure
2016-08-11T16:56:20 <alanharnum> this is the repo here: https://github.com/fluid-project/myl3
2016-08-11T16:56:54 <Justin_o> alanharnum: it seems that anyone with read permission or higher can create repos https://help.github.com/articles/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization/
2016-08-11T16:57:27 <alanharnum> weird
2016-08-11T16:57:46 <alanharnum> maybe they changed that when they changed the payment structure
2016-08-11T16:59:07 <Justin_o> alanharnum: they\'ve made a bunch of changes to teams, permissions, and etc since we originally set them up.. i should try to review some of the options at some point... and clean things up in general.
2016-08-11T17:03:01 <Bosmon> Hi cindyli - this function is quite a mess
2016-08-11T17:03:54 <Bosmon> You can\'t directly use .map here because you\'ve already constructed the return promise
