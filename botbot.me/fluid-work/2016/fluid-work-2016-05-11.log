2016-05-11T11:29:36 <Bosmon> amatas - well, it is interesting to know that the production tests always fail
2016-05-11T11:29:45 <Bosmon> In many ways the main point of this exercise :)
2016-05-11T11:41:34 <amatas> I spend some hours trying to make them run properly without success :( . Bosmon, do you think that may be worth to spend some more time trying to fix those tests?
2016-05-11T11:42:21 <Bosmon> amatas - the purpose of this exercise is to ensure they will pass :)
2016-05-11T11:42:34 <Bosmon> I\'ll see if I can make them run in trunk first
2016-05-11T11:45:13 <amatas> thanks Bosmon my knowledge of the GPII\'s guts is very limited.
2016-05-11T11:45:34 <Bosmon> kasparnet - would you like to take a look too?

2016-05-11T13:47:26 <PaliwalSparsh> Go here I created a bot to link our IRC and a gitter
2016-05-11T13:49:06 <from-fluid-IRC_> [gtirloni] test 123
2016-05-11T13:49:26 <gtirloni> it works :)

2016-05-11T14:15:47 <gtirloni> gitter\'s irc bridge uses node, it might be an interesting sideproject to improve it (i\'ve noticed message flow from gitter to irc, but not the other way around)
2016-05-11T14:16:21 <gtirloni> sameroom.io is very convenient. i thought about moving to slack myself and connecting everything else to it using sameroom.io but their pricing model scared me a bit
2016-05-11T14:17:02 * amatas joined the channel
2016-05-11T14:17:33 <gtirloni> i\'ve talked to them, trying to find out if there was free plan for open source projects but there isn\'t one. i understood their take on this is to let individual participants set up the "tubes" and pay for it

2016-05-11T14:28:57 <PaliwalSparsh> @gtirloni I asked them for a non profit plan they gave me a link to redeem a free plan. I will save it for if our community requires it.

2016-05-11T14:30:48 <gtirloni> duhrer: the mapping is one-to-one.. this channel to that gitter room. it won\'t provide the full experience
2016-05-11T14:31:01 <gtirloni> PaliwalSparsh: cool. maybe i wasn\'t clear explaining it to them
2016-05-11T14:32:12 <from-fluid-IRC_> [PaliwalSparsh (PaliwalSparsh)] Hope it works

2016-05-11T15:03:31 <alanharnum> hm, not sure if this impacts us organizationally or not: https://github.com/blog/2164-introducing-unlimited-private-repositories
2016-05-11T15:03:46 <alanharnum> but certainly nice for those of us with paid personal accounts for private projects
2016-05-11T15:05:31 <Justin_o> alanharnum: i was just reading that too, i guess we should figure out about our organization at some point
2016-05-11T15:05:48 <alanharnum> it doesn\'t look like they\'re forcing orgs to move to the per-seat model any time soon
2016-05-11T15:06:00 <alanharnum> i\'m not sure what we pay for our current plans for the various orgs
2016-05-11T15:06:24 <Justin_o> alanharnum: i think only one of them has private repos and it was donated by them if i recall correctly

2016-05-11T16:59:10 <colinclark> avtar: I\'m particularly interested in your thoughts on Tony\'s emails about testem and instanbul
2016-05-11T16:59:19 <colinclark> since I imagine there\'s two parts to the issue
2016-05-11T16:59:44 <alanharnum> Justin_o: that sounds like a reminder that I need to write up that "using Infusion with third-party libraries" document at some point... :)
2016-05-11T16:59:47 <colinclark> 1. As a development team, do we want to do this kind of testing, and if so, to what degree?
2016-05-11T17:00:02 <colinclark> and 2. How do we want to weave it into our CI/quality infrastructure?
2016-05-11T17:00:13 <colinclark> so my impression is that #1 is probably a cautious "yes"
2016-05-11T17:00:19 <colinclark> but I have less insight into #2, avtar
2016-05-11T17:00:20 <Justin_o> alanharnum: :) that would be great
2016-05-11T17:03:09 <the-t-in-rtf> why a "cautious" yes?
2016-05-11T17:05:04 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, I will be AFK for long periods, it is very much the end of the day.  Will review the chat later.  Happy to meet on the topic.

2016-05-11T17:23:55 <avtar> colinclark, the-t-in-rtf: istanbul ci integration should work as long as we can use a report format that\'s supported by istanbul and a ci server like jenkins. looks like they both can agree on cobertura and there\'s a jenkins job builder plugin that we can use http://docs.openstack.org/infra/jenkins-job-builder/publishers.html#publishers.cobertura

2016-05-11T17:31:47 <avtar> we\'ll need to test both to get an idea of what the pros and cons are
