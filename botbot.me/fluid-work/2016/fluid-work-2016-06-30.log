b'2016-06-30T23:27:19 <colinclark> arg
2016-06-30T23:27:33 <colinclark> seems very likely, yes
2016-06-30T23:27:56 <colinclark> gtirloni\'s PRs, which I merged earlier for all the GPII repositories, bump the VM\'s memory up to 256 MB
2016-06-30T23:28:14 <colinclark> and disable 3D acceleration
2016-06-30T23:28:15 <Bosmon> In theory, the corruption just covers Chrome\'s area of the screen, but in practice, the VM has become unusable
2016-06-30T23:28:22 <colinclark> however it looks like we didn\'t get this into Infusion
2016-06-30T23:28:34 <colinclark> today is a frustrating day for avtar and me :(
2016-06-30T23:28:37 <colinclark> and it\'s late
2016-06-30T23:28:38 <Bosmon> I can\'t get it to respond to any mouse events
2016-06-30T23:28:47 <colinclark> and I still have to go christmas shopping
2016-06-30T23:28:51 <Bosmon> CHristmas!
2016-06-30T23:28:54 <Bosmon> Oh wow
2016-06-30T23:28:57 <Bosmon> The screen came back
2016-06-30T23:29:03 <Bosmon> And I got 124 test passes
2016-06-30T23:29:05 <colinclark> and my hair stylist hasn\'t emailed me back
2016-06-30T23:29:07 <colinclark> life is rough
2016-06-30T23:29:08 <colinclark> that\'s great
2016-06-30T23:29:17 <Bosmon> I\'ll try the linux repo again
2016-06-30T23:29:21 <colinclark> well, don\'t bother
2016-06-30T23:29:22 <Bosmon> Perhaps "some magic" will have dislodged it
2016-06-30T23:29:27 <colinclark> you\'ll encounter the errrors I did
2016-06-30T23:29:36 <colinclark> it\'s sort of  tough issue
2016-06-30T23:29:58 <colinclark> i\'m just trying to sort it out with avtar
2016-06-30T23:36:17 <gtirloni> back
2016-06-30T23:40:38 <colinclark> Bosmon: Okay, I\'ve added some comments here: https://github.com/GPII/linux/pull/83#issuecomment-229818532
2016-06-30T23:40:46 <colinclark> and I made a pull request to your fork of linux
2016-06-30T23:41:24 <colinclark> which switches the ansible requirement to avtar\'s fork
2016-06-30T23:41:31 <colinclark> which will allow you to advance to issue #2
2016-06-30T23:42:07 <colinclark> i.e. that the tests seem to be failing for me, anyway, due to node-jqunit not being found
2016-06-30T23:42:15 <colinclark> at this point, who knows what the issue is?
2016-06-30T23:42:21 <colinclark> it could be a provisioning problem, could be something stupid
2016-06-30T23:42:26 <Bosmon> Yes, my memories are now surfacing that I created this pull request in a fluster during an architecture meeting
2016-06-30T23:42:31 <colinclark> aha
2016-06-30T23:42:36 <Bosmon> Saying, "whoops, I didn\'t seem to create this pull request for some reason"
2016-06-30T23:42:42 <colinclark> oh yes!
2016-06-30T23:42:43 <colinclark> that\'s right
2016-06-30T23:42:50 <Bosmon> Apologies for this braino
2016-06-30T23:42:56 <colinclark> no worries
2016-06-30T23:42:57 <Bosmon> Clearly there was a very good reason I hadn\'t created the pull request
2016-06-30T23:43:08 <Bosmon> Which was that I hadn\'t finished the work on it
2016-06-30T23:43:11 <colinclark> :)
2016-06-30T23:46:31 <Bosmon> Yes, the tests indeed fail
2016-06-30T23:46:33 <Bosmon> Let me fix my branch
2016-06-30T23:46:34 <colinclark> ok
2016-06-30T23:46:35 <colinclark> phew
2016-06-30T23:46:38 <colinclark> we have another problem
2016-06-30T23:46:51 <colinclark> which is that it looks like our mac minis are overheating in the data centre
2016-06-30T23:46:55 <colinclark> because apple fucking sucks
2016-06-30T23:46:57 <colinclark> i just said that
2016-06-30T23:47:05 <colinclark> oh well
2016-06-30T23:47:20 <Bosmon> Oh yes, of course
2016-06-30T23:47:28 <Bosmon> The issue is that the package.json is referring to the wrong revision of universal
2016-06-30T23:47:35 <colinclark> oh easy!
2016-06-30T23:49:05 <Bosmon> Interestingly the Linux repo README has no instructions on how to run the tests
2016-06-30T23:51:58 <colinclark> Bosmon: yes it does
2016-06-30T23:52:06 <colinclark> all prose-like
2016-06-30T23:52:08 <colinclark> https://github.com/gpii/linux#getting-started
2016-06-30T23:54:39 <Bosmon> Oh yes, I see
2016-06-30T23:54:44 <Bosmon> But it includes no instructions on how to run them natively
2016-06-30T23:54:59 <colinclark> natively?
2016-06-30T23:55:06 <colinclark> like on your host
2016-06-30T23:55:08 <colinclark> ?
2016-06-30T23:55:09 <Bosmon> Yeah
2016-06-30T23:55:13 <Bosmon> Like that :)
2016-06-30T23:55:16 <colinclark> ah
2016-06-30T23:55:17 <colinclark> yes
2016-06-30T23:55:26 <colinclark> i believe htat\'s in my GhOST list
2016-06-30T23:57:33 <colinclark> Bosmon: I have verified that your linux PR is working when I update it to the right version of universal
2016-06-30T23:57:48 <Bosmon> colinclark - I just updated it and was trying to now test your PR
2016-06-30T23:57:53 <colinclark> cool
2016-06-30T23:58:02 <colinclark> hopefully you, too, can reproduce my success
2016-06-30T23:58:11 <Bosmon> Yes, I just did
2016-06-30T23:58:23 <colinclark> does vagrant ssh work for you on linux?
2016-06-30T23:58:25 <colinclark> or nowhere?
2016-06-30T23:58:37 <colinclark> gtirloni and avtar are advising me to hold off on merging all these pull requests, in order to let our CI server cool down :(
2016-06-30T23:58:41 <Bosmon> How could I test vagrant ssh on linux?
2016-06-30T23:58:49 <colinclark> "grunt tests"
2016-06-30T23:58:53 <Bosmon> tbh I have no idea what vagrant ssh really is
2016-06-30T23:59:04 <Bosmon> grunt tests where
2016-06-30T23:59:11 <gtirloni> Bosmon, inside the repo dir
2016-06-30T23:59:20 <Bosmon> Inside the repo dir from where!
2016-06-30T23:59:21 <colinclark> https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/cli/ssh.html
2016-06-30T23:59:30 <Bosmon> The suggestion is that I install vagrant *inside* a vagrant VM, or what?
2016-06-30T23:59:35 <colinclark> no no
2016-06-30T23:59:42 <colinclark> you\'ve got a linux repo, right?
2016-06-30T23:59:46 <Bosmon> Yes
2016-06-30T23:59:59 <colinclark> and you can provision a vagrant box when using my PR to your fork?

2016-06-30T19:18:27 <Bosmon> Hi bens__ - here you are asking about the details of the matchmaking pathway and its transforms, which are quite complex
2016-06-30T19:18:39 <Bosmon> cindyli has put together an excellent set of documentation and diagrams on this
2016-06-30T19:19:16 <Bosmon> bens__ - it is mostly in here, I think: https://github.com/GPII/gpii-payloads
2016-06-30T19:19:24 <cindyli> yes, thanks, Bosmon
2016-06-30T19:19:45 <Bosmon> With the very last stage documented here: https://github.com/GPII/gpii-payloads/blob/master/SettingsHandler.md

2016-06-30T19:21:42 <bens__> Bosmon, will read through that thank you
2016-06-30T19:22:05 <bens__> Bosmon, are those github links preferred over similar pages in the wiki such as https://wiki.gpii.net/w/Settings_Handler ?
2016-06-30T19:22:10 <Bosmon> bens__ yes
2016-06-30T19:22:35 <Bosmon> The github links represent much more recent and thorough documentation that arose through our work with the IBM APCP team earlier this year
2016-06-30T19:22:55 <Bosmon> Info you find in the wiki will be somewhat indicative but generally stale
2016-06-30T19:25:02 <Bosmon> If you do find any discrepancies in the gpii-payloads docs/examples, please do report to cindyli
2016-06-30T19:26:02 <bens__> will do
2016-06-30T19:26:18 <Bosmon> Cheers!

2016-06-30T20:22:51 <gloob> Bosmon: a decision need to be taken (is that proper english?) about the documentation, happened to me several times to choose where to dump stuff. I\'m fun of github though
2016-06-30T20:22:57 * Jess_ joined the channel
2016-06-30T20:23:16 <gloob> probably some kind of render system for markdown would be enough to build a new wiki from current git documentation

2016-06-30T20:23:25 <gloob> ops, he left
2016-06-30T20:24:35 <gloob> seems that .net assemblies could be compiled for neutral arch, that would be ace for us, I guess
2016-06-30T20:30:05 <avtar> hey gloob
2016-06-30T20:39:41 <Bosmon> gloob - yes, we have a kind of half-build docpad platform which is being worked on by jhung
2016-06-30T20:39:50 <Bosmon> But in the meantime we just dump .md files in github hopefully
2016-06-30T20:41:33 <Bosmon> half- built

2016-06-30T20:47:15 <jhung> Bosmon: We\'ve been in meetings with PressBooks - I\'ve been thinking perhaps we can automate builds of Pressbooks Wordpress sites which pull md content from github.  We\'d gain Pressbook features like searching, indexing, PDF, EPUB, and Mobi output. I\'d have to use Pressbooks a bit more, but it\'s something I want to explore.

2016-06-30T22:22:49 <colinclark> avtar\'s been looking at it
2016-06-30T22:22:56 <colinclark> some failures seem to be occuring
2016-06-30T22:23:22 <gtirloni> hmm
2016-06-30T22:24:38 <gtirloni> ok, error creating a dir inside the win10 box.. i think that might not be related but let\'s see
2016-06-30T22:25:11 <gtirloni> avtar: i\'m going out for dinner, i\'ll be back in 1h. please let me know if you need any help
2016-06-30T22:46:08 <colinclark> Bosmon: I can tell that neither you nor jhernandez tested the linux pull request for GPII-1848 using vagrant
2016-06-30T22:46:36 <colinclark> which to be honest is quite frustrating
2016-06-30T22:46:38 <Bosmon> My memory is that I did
2016-06-30T22:46:41 <Bosmon> But perhaps it lies
2016-06-30T22:46:45 <Bosmon> I am sorry for your frustration
2016-06-30T22:47:24 <colinclark> it\'s okay
2016-06-30T22:47:31 <colinclark> but somehow we have to make this part of the workflow
2016-06-30T22:47:53 <colinclark> interestingly, it\'s broken due to another upstream hack in the provisioning process which you have made redundant
2016-06-30T22:47:55 <colinclark> so that\'s good
2016-06-30T22:48:30 <Bosmon> I have tended to do a lot of things "in my mind" recently
2016-06-30T22:48:34 <colinclark> yeah
2016-06-30T22:48:36 <colinclark> i know the feeling
2016-06-30T22:55:12 <Bosmon> Oh yes, I remember now
2016-06-30T22:55:25 <Bosmon> There is some incomprehensible fault that causes the VM to enter the "Paused" state
2016-06-30T22:55:57 <Bosmon> I started to look into this, and presumably concluded that my life was too short
2016-06-30T22:56:34 <colinclark> The VM actually pauses?
2016-06-30T22:56:39 <Bosmon> Yes
2016-06-30T22:56:44 <colinclark> You don\'t receive a failure related to copying files?
2016-06-30T22:56:47 <Bosmon> no
2016-06-30T22:56:55 <colinclark> Such as
2016-06-30T22:56:58 <colinclark> ==> default: fatal: [localhost]: FAILED! => {"changed": true, "cmd": ["rsync", "-a", "/tmp/gpii-linux-framework-build-dir/../node_modules", "/home/vagrant/sync/../"], "delta": "0:00:00.004930", "end": "2016-06-30 22:41:43.939678", "failed": true, "rc": 23, "start": "2016-06-30 22:41:43.934748", "stderr": "rsync: link_stat \\"/tmp/node_modules\\" failed: No such file or directory (2)\
rsync error: some files/attrs were not transferred (see previous

2016-06-30T22:57:06 <Bosmon> Nothing like that
2016-06-30T22:57:08 <colinclark> ok
2016-06-30T22:57:11 <Bosmon> It hangs long before such a mature stage
2016-06-30T22:57:11 <colinclark> well
2016-06-30T22:57:16 <Bosmon> The last message I get is "==> default: Running provisioner: shell...
2016-06-30T22:57:17 <Bosmon> default: Running: inline script"
2016-06-30T22:57:19 <colinclark> we need to get your vagrant environment working
2016-06-30T22:57:26 <Bosmon> And then VirtualBox says that the VM state is "Paused"
2016-06-30T22:57:36 <colinclark> perhaps some screen sharing after the wedding?
2016-06-30T22:58:00 <Bosmon> And there is no control in the UI to cause it to do anything other than "Close"
2016-06-30T22:58:07 <colinclark> This is on your primary Windows development box?
2016-06-30T22:58:08 <Bosmon> I already reinstalled VirtualBox and Vagrant once each
2016-06-30T22:58:14 <Bosmon> Yes
2016-06-30T22:59:49 <colinclark> Do you see this behaviour with all repositories?
2016-06-30T22:59:53 <colinclark> Or only with the linux repo?
2016-06-30T23:00:16 <colinclark> Do you, for example, use the Infusion vagrant setup?
2016-06-30T23:02:20 <colinclark> I\'m curious also if you see the problems with a simpler VM
2016-06-30T23:02:51 <colinclark> such as the headless centos image that runs for osc.js or the GPII First Discovery Server, Bosmon
2016-06-30T23:04:43 <colinclark> It looks like in your old pasted error, it\'s complaining about there not being any free space
2016-06-30T23:04:58 <colinclark> and it\'s a host error
2016-06-30T23:05:43 <colinclark> avtar mentioned to me that rsync is only used *in* the VM itself, not between your host and the guest
2016-06-30T23:06:38 <Bosmon> Ok
2016-06-30T23:06:43 <Bosmon> I\'ve freed a lot of space since those days
2016-06-30T23:06:48 <Bosmon> The Infusion vagrant seems to run fine
2016-06-30T23:06:57 <Bosmon> At least it gets past the "inline script" stage
2016-06-30T23:07:48 <colinclark> oh cool
2016-06-30T23:08:15 <colinclark> I\'ve managed to fend off the out-of-space issues on my laptop by finally ditching my windows 10 manual VM
2016-06-30T23:08:40 <colinclark> At this point, the vagrant setup is so stable for me, I figured it was worth getting those 50 GB back in exchange for being able to use vagrant without scrambling to clear space
2016-06-30T23:09:16 <colinclark> though my windows 7 MIDI VM is precious :P
2016-06-30T23:16:01 <Bosmon> The Vagrant instructions in the Infusion README could do with some improvement
2016-06-30T23:18:28 <colinclark> yes
2016-06-30T23:18:42 <colinclark> in several repositories
2016-06-30T23:18:43 <Bosmon> I do actually have the VM up now
2016-06-30T23:18:49 <colinclark> avtar has a very smooth prose style
2016-06-30T23:18:51 <Bosmon> But so far unable to get the tests to run
2016-06-30T23:18:59 <colinclark> but sometimes it\'s nice to have a bulleted list of things you need to run
2016-06-30T23:19:01 <colinclark> what happens?
2016-06-30T23:19:19 <Bosmon> E:\\Source\\gits\\infusion-master>grunt tests

2016-06-30T23:20:00 <colinclark> what happens if you runt hat command in the VM\'s GUI?
2016-06-30T23:20:07 <colinclark> like open up a terminal window in GNOME Shell
2016-06-30T23:20:21 <colinclark> and run cd /home/vagrant/sync/; DISPLAY=:0 testem ci --file tests/testem.json
2016-06-30T23:21:13 <Bosmon> Looks like I\'ll need to type this in manually
2016-06-30T23:21:22 <Bosmon> Doesn\'t the vagrant build install the host additions for the clipboard?
2016-06-30T23:22:30 <Bosmon> Yes, if I run that, the tests run
2016-06-30T23:22:37 <colinclark> no, it doesn\'t include host additions
2016-06-30T23:23:05 <colinclark> ok, so there\'s a vagrant ssh issue for you, it seems
2016-06-30T23:23:26 <Bosmon> Perhaps it\'s the cause of the failure on the linux repo too
2016-06-30T23:23:29 <Bosmon> Whatever it is
2016-06-30T23:24:19 <colinclark> Well, I\'m getting two rounds of failures on your pull request in the linux repo right now
2016-06-30T23:24:39 <colinclark> The first is related to a hack upstream in the ansible playbook that our vagrant scripts runs
2016-06-30T23:24:46 <colinclark> which avtar has made a successful fix for
2016-06-30T23:24:59 <colinclark> the second is that the unit tests are failing
2016-06-30T23:26:46 <Bosmon> Ok, the unit tests ran fine in Firefox
2016-06-30T23:26:59 <Bosmon> Unfortunately, in starting up Chrome in the VM I get the most amazing screen corruption
2016-06-30T23:27:11 <Bosmon> Perhaps this is the 3d acceleration issue?

b'2016-06-30T17:05:39 <bens__> gloob, what is the payloads execution piece?
2016-06-30T17:05:39 <gloob> basically its a json with methods definition
2016-06-30T17:05:39 <gloob> yes
2016-06-30T17:05:39 <gloob> let me check it
2016-06-30T17:05:39 <Bosmon> gloob - your statement is a little confusing :)

2016-06-30T17:05:42 <gloob> Bosmon: I think bens__ understand it
2016-06-30T17:07:03 <Bosmon> gloob - let\'s hope so :)
2016-06-30T17:07:03 * cindyli1 joined the channel
2016-06-30T17:07:03 <gloob> my doubt is where the json parsing will live (js or edge or .net side) and how to drive the execution flow of methods
2016-06-30T17:07:41 <gloob> bens__: as far as I know it\'s just a json parser of the methods, and execution driver and result handler
2016-06-30T17:08:58 <gloob> but I\'m shiny new in this lands also =)
2016-06-30T17:09:01 <bens__> gloob, i think i follow you. Today, the edgejs version only exposes TurnOn and TurnOff for high contrast. But it will need to support options like which theme, hotkey active, etc

2016-06-30T17:11:17 <gloob> bens__: more than that, I think you need to implement a driver for calling any windows api method defined in a json file
2016-06-30T17:11:17 * amatas joined the channel
2016-06-30T17:11:17 <Bosmon> gloob - I think that\'s going a little far
2016-06-30T17:11:17 <Bosmon> The mission of the SpiSettingsHandler is pretty constrained
2016-06-30T17:11:17 <gloob> probably that\'s easy to do in .net using some instropection features
2016-06-30T17:11:17 <Bosmon> And its parameter and argument layout is a little flexible, but not very
2016-06-30T17:12:01 <bens__> gloob, i was thinking about providing a smaller surface, just whatever is defined here: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd317973(v=vs.85).aspx. At least to start
2016-06-30T17:12:07 <gloob> it\'s an interesting topic, because I think is not so much cost to implement it
2016-06-30T17:12:10 * jhung is now known as jhung_away
2016-06-30T17:13:42 <Bosmon> gloob - I think you are getting a little carried away here :)
2016-06-30T17:13:42 <gloob> and open an interesting door
2016-06-30T17:13:42 <Bosmon> gloob - yes, an interesting door to arbitrary security violations
2016-06-30T17:13:42 <Bosmon> I think you were yourself concerned about these a little earlier : P
2016-06-30T17:13:42 <gloob> yes, but I don\'t know the final results of that
2016-06-30T17:13:42 <Bosmon> We are not going to implement a declarative bridge that allows an invocation of arbitrary Windows API calls
2016-06-30T17:13:42 <gloob> maybe a whitelisting could solve the security issue
2016-06-30T17:13:42 <Bosmon> SImply a mapping for a limited subset of Spi API calls
2016-06-30T17:13:42 <gloob> ok makes sense
2016-06-30T17:13:42 <bens__> the .net approach, with constrained API to call on, will let us remove some of the Windows API stuff from the payload definitions (like uint32, pointer, typedefs, etc)
2016-06-30T17:13:42 <gloob> I\'m asking because its interesting for the macOS architecture
2016-06-30T17:14:12 <Bosmon> The idea behind the settingsHandler infrastructure is to create payloads which at least in theory can be conformed to a set of relatively simple schemas, which can then allow the security impact that they pose to be assessed
2016-06-30T17:16:14 <Bosmon> Also, different APIs will require somewhat different semantics in order to conform them to the settingsHandler idiom which is based on access to state - rather than an arbitrary RPC idiom
2016-06-30T17:16:14 <gloob> ok
2016-06-30T17:16:14 <Bosmon> So, APIs which are radically different in structure and idiom will require to be wrapped as different settingsHandlers
2016-06-30T17:16:15 <gloob> including other os, right?
2016-06-30T17:16:15 <Bosmon> For example, look at the differences between the registry settingsHandler and the SPI settingsHandler
2016-06-30T17:17:24 <Bosmon> In theory these could all have just been cast as an arbitrary "uber-handler" which invoked an arbitrary Win32 API
2016-06-30T17:18:22 <Bosmon> But it would have been a total mess
2016-06-30T17:19:49 <Bosmon> Whereas, for example, the gsettings settings handler on Linux is much more amenable to this approach
2016-06-30T17:19:49 <Bosmon> Since it was designed around a "state access" idiom in the first place

2016-06-30T17:20:02 <gloob> colinclark: pad.gpii.net is working again :)
2016-06-30T17:21:59 <gloob> Bosmon: ok, thanks
2016-06-30T17:21:59 <colinclark> gloob: SOmeone\'s going to have to teach me the UI for it
2016-06-30T17:21:59 <gloob> Bosmon: so, is it crazy to think about an abstract language for executing the settings and states changes coming from MM or whatever into the different OS implementations?
2016-06-30T17:21:59 <Bosmon> gloob - this already exists
2016-06-30T17:21:59 <gloob> oh
2016-06-30T17:21:59 <Bosmon> It is called.... "settings handlers" : P
2016-06-30T17:21:59 <gloob> where
2016-06-30T17:21:59 <gloob> ah
2016-06-30T17:21:59 <gloob> xD
2016-06-30T17:22:38 <gloob> but we are doing more things that change settings, for the good and for the bad
2016-06-30T17:22:38 <Bosmon> no things
2016-06-30T17:23:29 <Bosmon> All things that change settings are mediated through settings handlers
2016-06-30T17:23:29 <Bosmon> It is what they are for
2016-06-30T17:23:29 <Bosmon> We even have an open JIRA to cast process execution and destruction in the form of settings handlers
2016-06-30T17:24:36 <gloob> Bosmon: this, right? https://github.com/GPII/universal/tree/master/gpii/node_modules/settingsHandlers/src
2016-06-30T17:26:59 <Bosmon> gloob - that\'s just a particular set of built-in settings handlers that aren\'t architecture-dependent
2016-06-30T17:26:59 <Bosmon> The ones that are based on file formats
2016-06-30T17:26:59 <Bosmon> Although there are some utilities there which support settings handlers in general
2016-06-30T17:26:59 <Bosmon> Each architecture has its own settingsHandlers modules which conform to the same general contract
2016-06-30T17:26:59 <Bosmon> gloob - here\'s some general discussion: https://wiki.gpii.net/w/Settings_Handler
2016-06-30T17:26:59 <Bosmon> A little out of date
2016-06-30T17:26:59 <gloob> I can imagine :)
2016-06-30T17:27:35 <Bosmon> We did actually have a plan for a generalised "Intents" based settingsHandler on Android, based on Java Reflection
2016-06-30T17:29:41 <Bosmon> SInce I think that API is relatively regular
2016-06-30T17:29:41 <Bosmon> But I think that the Win32 API is in general too "wild and woolly"
2016-06-30T17:29:42 <Bosmon> We could only expect to make sense of little patches of it at a time
2016-06-30T17:29:45 <gloob> yeah
2016-06-30T17:29:45 <gloob> ok
2016-06-30T17:29:45 <gloob> doesn\'t makes sense a general execution driver for windows, got it
2016-06-30T17:29:45 <Bosmon> I guess edge does take away a lot of the more horrible data conversion issues
2016-06-30T17:29:45 <Bosmon> But I imagine it won\'t take away all of them
2016-06-30T17:30:31 <gloob> well, I\'m more positive with the idea to maintain the core windows code in .net side
2016-06-30T17:30:31 <Bosmon> ok
2016-06-30T17:30:31 <gloob> at the end is the best
2016-06-30T17:32:44 <gloob> define your api and expose it through ffi, edge or whatever and implement it in .net/c/c++ win stuff
2016-06-30T17:32:44 <gloob> that\'s the reason I see some kind of common API in that bridge
2016-06-30T17:32:45 <gloob> that could be useful for settings handlers
2016-06-30T17:32:45 <Bosmon> gloob - so far we have this, on Windows: https://github.com/GPII/windows/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/WindowsUtilities/WindowsUtilities.js
2016-06-30T17:32:45 <Bosmon> I imagine that bens__ will build up something similar for use with .NET based settings handlers
2016-06-30T17:32:45 <gloob> I know, I patched it
2016-06-30T17:33:32 <Bosmon> As you say, .NET reflection will let us slim this down a lot
2016-06-30T17:33:32 * gabrielmancini has quit
2016-06-30T17:33:32 <Bosmon> Since we won\'t need to reproduce the contents of every Win32 .h file in JavaScript
2016-06-30T17:33:32 <gloob> yes
2016-06-30T17:33:36 * cindyli joined the channel
2016-06-30T17:33:49 <gloob> and have one dll with all the code with known .net compilation result
2016-06-30T17:34:49 <bens__> Bosmon, the entirety of win32 in javascript: https://gist.github.com/Benvie/3361208
2016-06-30T17:34:49 <gloob> the problem with the current ffi approach is that you\'re actually coding win32 code in nodejs side, that\'s bad
2016-06-30T17:34:49 <bens__> found that recently
2016-06-30T17:34:49 <Bosmon> bens__ - hilarious :)
2016-06-30T17:34:49 <gloob> it\'s safe just call the entrypoint in the .net side
2016-06-30T17:35:29 <Bosmon> gloob - well, when you say "that\'s bad", you\'re referring to the entire ffi approach
2016-06-30T17:36:56 <gloob> bens__: that\'s gold
2016-06-30T17:36:56 <Bosmon> There are indeed many people who agree with that assessment :)
2016-06-30T17:36:56 <Bosmon> But at the time, there was little alternative
2016-06-30T17:36:56 <gloob> Bosmon: well, I think you can use other architectural approach
2016-06-30T17:36:56 <Bosmon> We can consider ourselves lucky, I guess, that we have determined that we no longer have any requirement to support Windows XP
2016-06-30T17:36:56 <gloob> absolutely
2016-06-30T17:36:56 <gloob> Bosmon: but, well, seeing bens__ awesome experiment, I bet for edge if its runs well
2016-06-30T17:37:06 <Bosmon> But back in 2012 this was far from clear
2016-06-30T17:37:34 <Bosmon> gloob - yes, here\'s hoping
2016-06-30T17:39:28 <gloob> Bosmon: no critics here, just dumping my ideas about it
2016-06-30T17:42:30 <gloob> bens__: do you visual studio for test the experiment, right?
2016-06-30T17:44:27 <gloob> bens__: oh yes, it\'s in the setup steps

2016-06-30T18:23:53 <bens__> hi Bosmon, gloob, i\'m reading code to understand where the spiSettingsHandler fits into the overall system and find who calls it. It seems that because com.microsoft.windows.highContrast has a type of gpii.windows.spiSettingsHandler (https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/solutions/win32.json#L903) that *something* must be calling gpii.windows.spiSettingsHandler.set (https://github.com/GPII/windows/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/
2016-06-30T18:23:53 <bens__> spiSettingsHandler/src/SpiSettingsHandler.js#L263) which in turn calls the setImpl function.. and I think I can continue tracing from there. But who initially calls gpii.windows.spiSettingsHandler.set.. is that a flowmanager job?
2016-06-30T18:24:17 <Bosmon> bens__ - LifecycleManager.js
2016-06-30T18:24:30 <Bosmon> This is a component managed by the FlowManager, yes

2016-06-30T18:30:14 <Bosmon> The workflow has become a little tortuous over time, with the requirement to support i) asynchronous settings handlers, and ii) broken settings handlers like, e.g. SPI! which don\'t actually set the settings synchronously when asked

The handlerSpec.options seems to be referring to the options defined for the solution like these: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/solutions/win32.json#L904.

2016-06-30T13:01:43 <the-t-in-rtf> OK, I don't use vidyo often, hopefully I can find your room.
2016-06-30T13:02:14 <cindyli> we can use skype if you cannot find :) let me know
2016-06-30T13:02:41 <simonjb> I'm here and either vidyo or skype works for me :)

2016-06-30T13:57:43 <the-t-in-rtf> Not that we test anything else against mobile browsers, but I noticed that Opera Mini isn't supported by PouchDB, so I checked the current market share:  https://www.netmarketshare.com/browser-market-share.aspx
2016-06-30T14:01:40 <the-t-in-rtf> Looks like only IE 10 and higher are supported:  https://pouchdb.com/adapters.html#pouchdb_in_the_browser
2016-06-30T14:01:50 <the-t-in-rtf> Oh, WOW.  Somehow I missed this:  https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/WindowsForBusiness/End-of-IE-support
2016-06-30T14:02:07 <the-t-in-rtf> As of six months ago ONLY IE 11 and Edge are supported
2016-06-30T14:02:07 * danayo joined the channel
2016-06-30T14:04:29 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, turns out that only the highest browser version available for each platform is supported.
2016-06-30T14:04:52 <the-t-in-rtf> Given that 7 and higher all support 11, only Vista is a problem.
2016-06-30T14:05:26 <the-t-in-rtf> It's already only in extended support, so I think we're justified in moving beyond it.
2016-06-30T14:07:14 <simonjb> cool, thanks the-t-in-rtf
2016-06-30T14:17:54 <simonjb> michelled: cindyli and I met with Tony and Antranig this morning and I'm thinking that we should check in with you and update you
2016-06-30T14:18:18 <simonjb> when would be a good time?
2016-06-30T14:18:30 <michelled> good question - with google calendar down I have no idea :)
2016-06-30T14:18:38 <simonjb> :(
2016-06-30T14:18:41 <michelled> I think I'm pretty free today
2016-06-30T14:19:00 <simonjb> are you in the office?
2016-06-30T14:22:39 <michelled> no, I'm at home today. I just checked with Sandra and I'm not meeting with her. I can meet anytime simonjb
2016-06-30T14:24:05 <simonjb> michelled, cindyli, shall we chat now-ish?
2016-06-30T14:24:16 <michelled> yes

2016-06-30T14:24:46 <gtirloni> michelled, i thought we had booked the whole day today for going over details of the tasks 1-4 of the other project
2016-06-30T14:24:47 <cindyli> ok, my room
2016-06-30T14:24:58 <michelled> gtirloni: \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6.

2016-06-30T15:36:11 <the-t-in-rtf> It's time sheet time, so it's a bit of a PiTA.
2016-06-30T15:36:17 <the-t-in-rtf> Thankfully my phone synced earlier.

2016-06-30T16:18:12 <bens__> colinclark, Bosmon, on edgejs, I have refined the edgejs work a bit. Currently have demos of edgejs->.NET->Windows API for Sticky Keys and High Contrast. Also a demo of sending JSON between nodejs and .NET. Most recent code is in https://github.com/benjaminstokes/gpii-edge-experiment. The readme will walk you through tracing the code if you're interested to see
2016-06-30T16:19:14 <bens__> i'm going to turn next to looking at replacing the node-ffi bits of the spi settings handler with the edgejs
2016-06-30T16:19:20 <colinclark> bens__: this is really awesome

2016-06-30T16:58:37 <gloob> bens__: https://github.com/benjaminstokes/gpii-edge-experiment/blob/master/lib-windows-gpii-edgejs-driver/dotnetfunctions.js this is the main importing, right?
2016-06-30T16:58:47 <bens__> gloob, correct
2016-06-30T16:58:57 <gloob> I though edge.js only allowed embedded .net code
2016-06-30T16:59:08 <gloob> in that way it was one of my ideas about
2016-06-30T16:59:15 <gloob> in that case is awesome
2016-06-30T16:59:27 <gloob> better to have the control in the windows side and export just our methods
2016-06-30T16:59:53 <bens__> you can do inline via comments.. and most examples are.. but you can use a library like that github link as well
2016-06-30T16:59:54 <bens__> yep
2016-06-30T17:00:51 <bens__> the importing basically exposes these to nodejs: https://github.com/benjaminstokes/gpii-edge-experiment/blob/master/lib-windows-gpii/lib-windows-gpii/EdgeBindings.cs
2016-06-30T17:05:22 * gabrielmancini has quit
2016-06-30T17:05:38 <gloob> you are getting my patches about node-ffi outdated :(
2016-06-30T17:05:38 <gloob> I think is pretty straightforward to integrate it, any plan for it?
2016-06-30T17:05:38 * gabrielmancini joined the channel
2016-06-30T17:05:38 <gloob> and one thing is missing in the experiment is the payloads execution through ffi, did you have any plans for it Bosmon colinclark ?
2016-06-30T17:05:38 * lliskovoi joined the channel
2016-06-30T17:05:39 <bens__> my plan so far is to take the spi settings handler and hack it up to remove node-ffi and replace with edgejs->.net. I think the edgejs/.net api piece will need some refactoring along the way to support whatever the settings handler needs.. I still need to read and understand the settings handler code
