2016-01-20T15:49:34 <Justin_o> jhung: how are things going?
2016-01-20T15:51:26 <jhung> Justin_o: things are going well so far. We\'re just catching up on emails and whatnot. Presentations will be in 2 hours once the team is assembled.
2016-01-20T15:53:27 <Justin_o> jhung: good luck, and let me know if you want to schedule a meeting.
2016-01-20T15:54:00 <jhung> ok Justin_o - I\'ll keep that in mind. I\'m going to encourage people to join the channel.

2016-01-20T15:55:06 <Justin_o> jhung: that\'s a great idea
2016-01-20T15:57:15 <jhung> btw Justin_o - do you have admin privs on the Fluid Team schedule on google calendar? I can\'t seem to add events anymore to the calendar.
2016-01-20T15:58:30 <Justin_o> jhung: gtirloni was cleaning that up to try to fix the issue we\'ve been having with time slots.
2016-01-20T15:59:36 <gtirloni> jhung: what google account are you using? jonhung@ is the one allowed there. should it be changed?
2016-01-20T16:00:46 <jhung> ah. So that might be related Justin_o. gtirloni - I use two: jhung.work@ and jhung@ocadu. The jonhung@ can be removed.
2016-01-20T16:01:59 <gtirloni> jhung: added that one and removed jonhung@. please reload :)
2016-01-20T16:02:21 <jhung> thanks gtirloni. I\'ll check now.

2016-01-20T16:23:02 <jhung> Justin_o: something that\'s coming up already in discussions is how to make an 3rd party assessment "question player" accessible within the EdReady portal. So it may be an iframe or something else.
2016-01-20T16:27:22 <jhung> Justin_o: I\'m going to start a google doc with notes.
2016-01-20T16:42:03 <jhung> fluid-everyone: I\'ll be taking notes over the next 3 days while I am at Edify. They are looking to improve the accessibility and inclusiveness of their LMS by implementing processes and practices. If anyone wants to see the notes, please let me know so I can send you the link to the google doc.

2016-01-20T17:13:39 <alanharnum> don\'t know what\'s going on with my mike and gotomeeting - I think it might not be using my headset mic, even though it\'s claiming to do so
2016-01-20T17:14:53 <gtirloni> alanharnum: yep, that sometimes happens to me. with gotomeeting i sometimes was using the usb headset to talk and the regular headset to hear.. i guess in your case it would be using the laptop built-in mic
2016-01-20T17:15:16 <alanharnum> yeah i think that\'s why people are hearing me but too faintly to be useful
2016-01-20T17:15:17 <gtirloni> (i finally got everything to use the usb headset for listening/talking with gotomeeting, it\'s okay now)

2016-01-20T17:27:04 <Justin_o> cindyli: did we have a strategy for closing tooltips that are attached to other components.
2016-01-20T17:27:36 <cindyli> we did as i rmb, Justin_o. recalling\xe2\x80\xa6
2016-01-20T17:28:53 <cindyli> Justin_o: the strategy seems is to close others explicitly by calling close() :)

2016-01-20T17:32:22 <Justin_o> cindyli: okay, thanks... i\'ll see if i can work something like that into uio integration work.. i\'m wondering now though if we need to have two separate tooltip components.. i\'ll investigate this a bit
2016-01-20T17:32:46 <cindyli> thanks, Justin_o
2016-01-20T17:55:22 <alanharnum> This story is oddly topical in its analysis of what drives institutional technology adoption, despite being about missile weapon choice in the medieval era: http://boingboing.net/2016/01/20/solving-the-longbow-puzzle.html

2016-01-20T18:11:25 <Justin_o> Bosmon: was the tooltip component supposed to only show one tooltip at a time?
2016-01-20T18:11:47 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes
2016-01-20T18:12:14 <Justin_o> i\'ve attached a single tooltip to a component that adds tooltips for a couple of buttons. I\'m finding that if i hover over one and put focus on the other I get two tooltips
2016-01-20T18:12:27 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i just want to confirm if this is expected or not

2016-01-20T18:30:54 <Justin_o> Bosmon2: i think i\'ve found the problem. It\'s because this is for UIO and the tooltips are attached to the component in the iframe. However, the tooltip component doesn\'t set the document argument for fluid.byId so it is looking in the wrong document.
2016-01-20T18:30:55 <Justin_o> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/components/tooltip/js/Tooltip.js#L97
2016-01-20T18:31:00 <Justin_o> Bosmon2: any thoughts on that?
2016-01-20T18:39:37 <Bosmon> Justin_o - that\'s quite interesting
2016-01-20T18:39:55 <Bosmon> Would you be able to write up a JIRA and fix?
2016-01-20T18:39:58 <Bosmon> Or at least a test case
2016-01-20T18:41:21 <Justin_o> Bosmon: sure, i\'ll write up a JIRA and should be able to come up with a test case, not sure of the fix though.
2016-01-20T18:41:44 <Bosmon> Justin_o - awesome!
