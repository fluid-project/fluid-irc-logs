2016-12-13T17:48:02 <Justin_o> jhung: do you know if there is a way to reset the default theme in wordpress. I was trying some customizations but want to reset it now, but don't see the option.
2016-12-13T17:48:33 <jhung> Justin_o: you mean you edited the theme's PHP files?
2016-12-13T17:48:44 <jhung> and you want to revert?
2016-12-13T17:49:00 <Justin_o> jhung: yes, but i didn't edit the php file, i used the customize option
2016-12-13T17:49:10 <Justin_o> but the thing i changed doesn't seem to have a way to change it back
2016-12-13T17:49:24 <Justin_o> i hid the header image, but can't seem to put it back
2016-12-13T17:50:05 * alanharnum joined the channel
2016-12-13T17:50:30 <jhung> yeah, that changes the theme. The easiest way is to delete it and reinstall that theme. Next time you should clone the theme's directory and work from that clone Justin_o.
2016-12-13T17:50:49 <Justin_o> :(
2016-12-13T17:50:55 <Justin_o> how do i delete the theme
2016-12-13T17:51:08 <Justin_o> jhung: actually i might just restart and write up my notes as I go
2016-12-13T17:51:46 <jhung> Justin_o: you should be able to do that from WP's theme manager.
2016-12-13T17:52:16 <Justin_o> jhung: i don't see a delete option
2016-12-13T17:52:20 <Justin_o> want to vidyo?
2016-12-13T17:53:06 <jhung> sure

2016-12-13T18:03:06 <Justin_o> gtirloni: i'm going to write a quick developer dock for the WP UIO plugin. Is it okay to link to the tar file you posted on https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6095
2016-12-13T18:03:22 <Justin_o> and suggest that they use that for getting an instance up and running
2016-12-13T18:06:20 <gtirloni> i think that's okay for now to get some initial traction, there are likely bugs that we can iron out before submitting a PR to GPII/qi-dev-envs
