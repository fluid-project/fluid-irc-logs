b'2016-08-30T13:11:40 <Justin_o> ah never mind that requires template literals, missed that
2016-08-30T13:11:49 <Bosmon> Justin_o - see, it requires a whole extra language feature just to recover the original bloody string : P
2016-08-30T13:11:59 <Bosmon> If it had just been a string in the first place, we could all have gone home early
2016-08-30T13:12:08 <Justin_o> haha
2016-08-30T13:12:11 <Bosmon> As well as being able to store them in ...... FILES!
2016-08-30T13:12:14 <Bosmon> FILES!
2016-08-30T13:12:36 <alanharnum> "files"?
2016-08-30T13:12:38 <Bosmon> ES6 has largely gone the way of C++
2016-08-30T13:12:44 <Bosmon> The lunatic committees have taken over
2016-08-30T13:12:55 <Justin_o> Bosmon: like this http://es6-features.org/#TypedArrays
2016-08-30T13:13:46 <alanharnum> i wonder how much of this ES6 newness will actually get used
2016-08-30T13:14:22 <alanharnum> given i think some of what has driven JS adoption as a "serious" language is the (like LISP) the sparse core.
2016-08-30T13:14:26 <Justin_o> alanharnum: i suppose it would depend on the application and coding style.. perhaps these will be used more frequently in node environments that in the web
2016-08-30T13:15:00 <alanharnum> in some ways ES6 seems like a fight played out in public between theories of language design.
2016-08-30T13:15:08 <Bosmon> TypedArrays do actually represent a usefully new feature
2016-08-30T13:15:18 <Bosmon> But we\'ve actually had them for years
2016-08-30T13:15:18 <alanharnum> leading, as Bosmon says, to a lot of feature-stuffing via committee
2016-08-30T13:16:34 <Justin_o> alanharnum: i wonder if there is also an attempt to migrate "favourite" features from other languages
2016-08-30T13:16:40 <alanharnum> yeah
2016-08-30T13:17:12 <alanharnum> the "Symbol" thing is very clearly from Ruby (or maybe Elixir, but probably from Ruby)
2016-08-30T13:19:13 <alanharnum> or maybe not according to this page: http://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_symbols.html
2016-08-30T13:19:24 <alanharnum> "7.9.4 Are JavaScript\xe2\x80\x99s symbols like Ruby\xe2\x80\x99s symbols?" "No, they are not."
2016-08-30T13:19:34 <alanharnum> That\'s a defensive "no they are not"
2016-08-30T13:24:04 <Justin_o> alanharnum: it\'s like they heard you talking about it
2016-08-30T13:24:11 <alanharnum> maybe they did

2016-08-30T17:02:51 <michelled> good question, Justin_o. it might be useful to put them on the iteration page.
2016-08-30T17:03:01 <Justin_o> michelled: okay
2016-08-30T17:04:03 <michelled> kavya: I\'m not familiar with \'Pie-app\'

2016-08-30T17:13:36 <michelled> maybe it\'s an autocorrect of gpii-app? https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app

2016-08-30T17:40:37 <michelled> thx Justin_o
2016-08-30T17:41:07 <Justin_o> michelled: i don\'t know what\'s happening with the Infusion build/packaging changes yet, so couldn\'t estimate that one. Otherwise, it looks like were a few weeks out
2016-08-30T17:41:38 <michelled> so possible release in October
2016-08-30T17:41:59 <Justin_o> michelled: yes, although I\'d hope earlier

2016-08-30T12:22:28 <Bosmon> Hi there Justin_o - would you be ok with adding this rule into our eslint configuration?
2016-08-30T12:22:29 <Bosmon> http://eslint.org/docs/rules/keyword-spacing
2016-08-30T12:22:43 <Bosmon> I noticed that alanharnum had some irregular spacing in his pull which our existing rules weren\'t catching
2016-08-30T12:23:10 <alanharnum> Bosmon Justin_o: I\'m just about to make a small NOJIRA PR to add that, if we\'re OK with it.
2016-08-30T12:23:18 <Bosmon> alanharnum - brilliant!
2016-08-30T12:23:19 <alanharnum> there\'s two Master files that need fixing in light of the rule
2016-08-30T12:23:38 <Justin_o> Bosmon, alanharnum: was just reading the PR comments. Makes sense to add that.
2016-08-30T12:25:35 * alanharnum is bad at running the linter himself, but good at using pre-commit hooks to do so... eventually.
2016-08-30T12:25:48 <Justin_o> alanharnum: :)
2016-08-30T12:26:39 <Justin_o> Bosmon: did you see my comment about json lint https://github.com/fluid-project/fluid-publish/pull/5#discussion_r76678181
2016-08-30T12:27:39 * cindyli joined the channel
2016-08-30T12:28:29 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I believe that eslint has a built-in ignore rule that skips node_modules
2016-08-30T12:28:37 <Bosmon> The chance that our dependencies pass its linting rules is zero :)
2016-08-30T12:29:02 <Bosmon> You may seem to see it running against node_modules because of the file number accounting problem that alanharnum patched upstream
2016-08-30T12:29:15 <alanharnum> jsonlint and es-lint are separate
2016-08-30T12:29:26 <Bosmon> oh sorry
2016-08-30T12:29:41 <Bosmon> I hope you\'ll excuse my continued not-seeing things in front of my eyes etc
2016-08-30T12:29:55 <Bosmon> And I hope you\'ll tell me if I\'m being a dork on your PR : P
2016-08-30T12:30:06 <Bosmon> I had about 1 hour sleep as a result of repeated trips to fetch nappies from the 24-hour supermarket
2016-08-30T12:30:19 <alanharnum> i get excused for enough similar stuff (and more) to not excuse that
2016-08-30T12:30:25 <alanharnum> and i also don\'t have the excuse of a new baby :)
2016-08-30T12:30:49 <Bosmon> Who would have recalled that the 24-hour supermarket is NOT OPEN ON THE NIGHT OF A BANK HOLIDAY
2016-08-30T12:30:58 <Bosmon> So I had to go back there again at 6am
2016-08-30T12:31:22 <Bosmon> No wait
2016-08-30T12:31:29 <Bosmon> I did read Justin_o\'s comment correctly
2016-08-30T12:31:37 <Bosmon> Perhaps it is YOU who has been to the 24 hour supermarket!
2016-08-30T12:31:49 <alanharnum> i did in fact go to the 24 hour supermarket on the way in
2016-08-30T12:31:57 <alanharnum> so your j\'accuse has, in fact, struck home
2016-08-30T12:31:59 <Bosmon> hahahaha
2016-08-30T12:32:19 <Bosmon> Justin_o - if you bump up to fluid-grunt-eslint version "18.1.2", you will get alanharnum\'s patch which corrects the linted files count
2016-08-30T12:32:39 <Bosmon> As I was remarking, if you don\'t write a .eslintignore file, it makes one up that includes node_modules by default
2016-08-30T12:39:22 <Justin_o> Bosmon: maybe i wrote the comment incorrectly.. :) actually alanharnum was correct it is specific to aslant and ES6 template literals. I want to drop the node_module that i\'m using for the template strings and use the built functionality after requiring node 4.0.0 or greater
2016-08-30T12:39:40 <Justin_o> but it seems that JSON lint won\'t accept the literal which uses back ticks
2016-08-30T12:39:57 <Bosmon> What\'s JSON lint got to do with it?
2016-08-30T12:40:03 <Bosmon> Surely the backticks don\'t occur in a .json file
2016-08-30T12:40:07 <Justin_o> they do
2016-08-30T12:40:08 <stegru> I also tried to go to the supermarket yesterday at 4:30 - the fact that I got a parking space so close made me suspicious
2016-08-30T12:40:17 <Bosmon> stegru - sorry
2016-08-30T12:40:21 <Bosmon> Do you have a young kid as well?
2016-08-30T12:40:28 <Bosmon> Justin_o - how can they appear in a l.json file?
2016-08-30T12:40:30 <Justin_o> Bosmon: they are in the package.json file as the defaults are stored in there
2016-08-30T12:40:31 <Bosmon> in a .json file
2016-08-30T12:40:38 <Bosmon> !
2016-08-30T12:40:44 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I can\'t understand this
2016-08-30T12:40:47 <Bosmon> Can you link me to an example?
2016-08-30T12:40:52 <Justin_o> Bosmon: https://github.com/fluid-project/fluid-publish/blob/master/package.json#L41-L55
2016-08-30T12:40:54 <stegru> no, I was just hungry
2016-08-30T12:40:57 <Bosmon> hahaha
2016-08-30T12:41:10 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i\'d want to convert some ore all of those to template literals
2016-08-30T12:41:18 <Bosmon> Yes, I ran into some very disappointed hungry people in the car park on my first visit at 2.30am
2016-08-30T12:41:43 <Bosmon> Justin_o - ah, I see, they occur in strings
2016-08-30T12:41:51 <Bosmon> Surely jsonlint can\'t be that faulty!
2016-08-30T12:42:26 <Bosmon> Those actually look like apostrophes rather than backticks
2016-08-30T12:42:41 <Bosmon> Are you convinced that they are backticks?
2016-08-30T12:42:42 <Justin_o> Bosmon: currently they are strings, but when template literals need to be specified like `hello ${world}` instead of "hello ${world}"
2016-08-30T12:42:48 <Bosmon> ah
2016-08-30T12:43:41 <Justin_o> Bosmon:  i actually have yet to find any information on whether they should be valid JSON or not
2016-08-30T12:44:02 <Justin_o> but i\'m likely just not searching well enough
2016-08-30T12:45:04 <Bosmon> https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159 has no suggestion that the backtick has a special status
2016-08-30T12:46:37 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i can only assume that JSON lint is expecting it to be in a string then
2016-08-30T12:46:51 <Bosmon> !
2016-08-30T12:46:56 <Bosmon> Of course it should be in a string
2016-08-30T12:47:38 <Bosmon> I\'m astonished to find people even more confused than I am at this time in the morning :)
2016-08-30T12:47:52 <Justin_o> haha
2016-08-30T12:47:54 <Bosmon> Of course the bare template literal is not valid JSON, and never will be
2016-08-30T12:47:59 <Bosmon> You need to put them in strings!
2016-08-30T12:49:48 <Bosmon> Wow
2016-08-30T12:49:58 <Justin_o> Bosmon: from the examples here it looks like it is purely defined with backticks https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals
2016-08-30T12:50:03 <Justin_o> but i could be missing something..
2016-08-30T12:50:12 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, this looks like a megatastically stupid language feature
2016-08-30T12:50:15 <Bosmon> I suggest you don\'t use it
2016-08-30T12:50:44 <Bosmon> Thank God noone will ever succeed in rewriting the JSON language spec :)
2016-08-30T12:51:27 <Bosmon> I mean, these things don\'t interpolate material from a supplied scope object, they interpolate things FROM YOUR OWN SCOPE!
2016-08-30T12:51:37 <Justin_o> Bosmon:  :) okay for now i\'ll leave in the library i\'m using and leave update the comment used there. I\'ll also bump the minimum version of node to 4.0.0
2016-08-30T12:51:56 <Bosmon> Really language designers are such boneheads, assuming that people want yet more unexternalisable features in their languages
2016-08-30T12:52:17 <Bosmon> I am just trying to finish a section in our PPIG paper on this topic.....
2016-08-30T12:53:33 <Justin_o> ah cool... yes i don\'t understand the need to use backticks. Perhaps to distinguish it from plain strings... or to make it easier to use single and double quotes within?
2016-08-30T12:54:05 <Bosmon> Well, you need to use backticks because this is some "syntactic magic" they\'ve just baked directly into the JS parser
2016-08-30T12:54:33 <Bosmon> They haven\'t even had the decency to expose the "type" of this magic thing as a language-level type, as they did with RegExp
2016-08-30T12:54:40 <Bosmon> At least, not that I can see
2016-08-30T12:55:21 <Bosmon> I guess they explicitly DON\'T want people constructing these things out of strings or any data which could be read in by the program, because of the appalling cross-site scripting risks
2016-08-30T12:56:00 <Bosmon> Given these things essentially have all the monstrous power of "eval" to read any value visible in your own scope .... at least they don\'t have the power to write them too : P
2016-08-30T12:56:31 <Justin_o> oh i see
2016-08-30T12:56:44 <Bosmon> There\'s not a single valuable feature in ES6 that I can see
2016-08-30T12:56:49 <Bosmon> At least ES5 gave us Object.freeze
2016-08-30T12:57:23 <Bosmon> I guess ES6 has WeakMap
2016-08-30T12:57:28 <Bosmon> That\'s at least notionally useful
2016-08-30T13:02:27 <Justin_o> Bosmon: there\'s some nice to haves like the new parameter handling (e.g. default parameter values http://es6-features.org/#DefaultParameterValues )
2016-08-30T13:03:12 <Bosmon> Yes, fine for people who want to keep calling functions :)
2016-08-30T13:03:33 <Bosmon> In practice, we want information like this to be readable at the design level of an application, as our defaults blocks are
2016-08-30T13:03:52 <the-t-in-rtf> For generated functions it could work
2016-08-30T13:04:13 <Bosmon> The only really useful features are the ones which do things that simply could never be done at all in the old language - in which category we can put i) Object.freeze(), ii) weird things like yield, iii) WeakMap
2016-08-30T13:04:18 <Bosmon> And these things are few and far between
2016-08-30T13:04:44 <Justin_o> Bosmon: any idea what this is for http://es6-features.org/#SymbolType
2016-08-30T13:05:17 <stegru> Generator functions are my favourites
2016-08-30T13:05:22 <Bosmon> Justin_o - just another monstrosity
2016-08-30T13:05:29 <Bosmon> An attempt to sneak a type system into JS through the back door
2016-08-30T13:05:41 <Bosmon> And yet another thing which could never be conceivably be serialised as JSON

2016-08-30T13:10:40 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i wonder if this would be good for debugging http://es6-features.org/#RawStringAccess
2016-08-30T13:11:02 <Justin_o> for example output error messages
