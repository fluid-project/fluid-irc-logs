2016-04-14T20:34:15 <akshay> Justin_o: I've updated the link with two games for the mathematical skill enhancement part that would be a part of the fully function-able game. Presently they not much to do with the preferences but in actual one the gameplay would be based on the preferences and the user would be able to check his performance with respect to his preferences on the dashboard
2016-04-14T20:34:31 <akshay> the performance would be based on the points he collect while playing the game. http://firstdiscovery.azurewebsites.net/
2016-04-14T20:36:42 <akshay> the first level is the wizard demo and the rest two levels are the game. I have implemented it this way now just for demonstration sake
2016-04-14T20:37:13 <akshay> using Phaser game states so that I don't have to write an entire backend now

It was mentioned during our meetings gpii will not use an authorization server with social media such as facebook, twitter,etc.  What authorization server is gpii planning on using?   Or is gpii planning on creating their own authorization server, if so  what well known package/framework is gpii planning on using?
2016-04-14T13:29:52 <Katy_> we have a wiki page on choosing user management tools, but I don\'t see one on the authorization server.

2016-04-14T13:43:40 <akshay> Justin_o: I have started with this short demo alongside deigning the architecture diagram, I would want you to have a look at it.
2016-04-14T13:43:45 <akshay> http://firstdiscovery.azurewebsites.net/
2016-04-14T13:45:21 <akshay> Modifying the player game art as well as using a little complex physics interaction system like ninja physics rather than using arcade physics is what I am working on now.
2016-04-14T13:46:03 * jhung1 joined the channel
2016-04-14T13:46:54 <akshay> You would be seeing the player game art a little displaced as well as the animations get little odd by shifting directions, those would be fixed as I fix the game art.
2016-04-14T13:47:36 <akshay> I have tested it on chrome and full screen mode would look good.
2016-04-14T13:50:46 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2016-04-14T13:55:07 <Justin_o> akshay: thanks for sending this along
2016-04-14T13:55:13 <Justin_o> what are the controls for it
2016-04-14T13:55:17 <Justin_o> is it just left/right arrow?
2016-04-14T13:55:38 <akshay> ya presently its just basic
2016-04-14T13:55:44 <akshay> only left right arrows
2016-04-14T13:55:54 <Katy_> simonjb  gpii will use oauth2orize to create the gpii authorization server.  How well established is oauth2orize?  Has it been used with an application that went live with a substantial public user base?
2016-04-14T13:55:59 * the-t-in-rtf has quit
2016-04-14T13:56:18 <akshay> and when you\'ll go closer to the wizard you\'ll have to press "I" to interact.
2016-04-14T13:57:11 <akshay> you\'ll be locked while the interaction is going on and if you select yes then the wizard will follow you.
2016-04-14T13:57:46 <Justin_o> akshay: did you draw the sprites?
2016-04-14T14:00:31 <akshay> the tileset on which the player is standing as well as the hills I made it from scratch because the original one from the free licensed one was not a vector art and was getting pixelated
2016-04-14T14:01:38 <akshay> the player sprite is a free licensed one from open game art which we can use as per our wishes. I am modifying that because those are separate png images
2016-04-14T14:01:55 <akshay> so I have to compile them in a spritesheet
2016-04-14T14:02:32 <akshay> presently you might be seeing the player raised a little bit above the ground I would be fixing that too.
2016-04-14T14:04:30 <akshay> I can design static backgrounds and arts very well, but not very experienced with designing spritesheets, so I\'ll either use the free ones from open game art or I would need a little help from you people or would try to make one for the character during the bonding period if I get selected because I want to get started with the coding immediately.
2016-04-14T14:05:09 <akshay> I think there is no issue with using the free ones? they are meant to be used for open source stuff?
2016-04-14T14:09:44 <akshay> what can be done in cases like this where there is no license agreements stated by the developer but it\'s on open game art and are all supposed to be GPL compatible.

2016-04-14T14:13:47 <Justin_o> akshay: actually that one looks like it\'s licensed as public domain
2016-04-14T14:14:40 <Justin_o> which would be perfectly fine to use.. it\'s still something that would need to be documented though.
2016-04-14T14:15:07 <Justin_o> i\'d say if you come across something that doesn\'t list a licences you\'d need to contact the creator directly and ask for one or just don\'t use it and find something else
2016-04-14T14:15:13 <Justin_o> akshay: ^

2016-04-14T14:16:14 <Justin_o> danayo: akshay left a demo for a game above
2016-04-14T14:17:24 <akshay> I will definitely do that Justin for the original project, now I\'m trying to put more focus on the implementation and coding things up.
2016-04-14T14:17:48 <akshay> arts can be simply replaced by any other that suits the theme.
2016-04-14T14:17:57 <danayo> thanks Justin_o, akshay
2016-04-14T14:21:50 <akshay> https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Public_domain doesn\'t the first line mean I\'m free to do whatever I wish to do with that art? I don\'t know everything about licensing but I\'ll try to do most of the designing by myself and for whatever free ones I use i\'ll ensure by contacting the developers that it\'s really free to use.
2016-04-14T14:23:19 <cindyli> Katy_: just saw ur inquiry about oauth2orize. a search shows a list of applications using this node module, i haven\'t looked into how public user base that those projects have. what is your concern? do you concern that oauth2orize is not secured?
2016-04-14T14:24:32 <Katy_> cindyli My concern is that oauth2orize may be secure now, but will it be continually updated for the newest security threats that is found.
2016-04-14T14:25:45 <cindyli> Katy_: i believe in order to avoid that, it requires a careful understanding of what has been updated
2016-04-14T14:26:59 <akshay> Justin_o , danayo : Also I\'m very happy to share with you that I have been selected for the Microsoft Imagine Cup National finals to be held in India for the SmartBin app that I had put in my introduction part of the proposal, so that is one more thing to add to my achievement :)

2016-04-14T14:28:39 <cindyli> Katy_: as you know that we follow certain criteria at picking a library or a technology. one criteria is the picked one has a strong team, community and support as well as a good amount of uses. This helps to avoid this issue in some extend too
2016-04-14T14:29:07 <Justin_o> akshay: congratulations :)

2016-04-14T14:33:51 <akshay> this kept me a little busy for the past few days. I would also be showing you two levels for the mathematical skill enhancing and the vocabulary part, which would be a part of the fully functionable game and would be based on the preference that user sets up.
2016-04-14T14:34:49 <Katy_> cindyli  That is good to hear. We will just need to see those supporting documents that it is well established.  Do you have a wiki page on it.   I am sure the gpii team was careful.  Out of curiousity did gpii consider the cloud foundary uaa. https://github.com/cloudfoundry/uaa
2016-04-14T14:36:06 <akshay> Presently it would be just a demo but in the actual project it would be linked up with the preference setting part and developed more in a way that it helps the users in enhancing his interaction with the digital device as well as testing his performances based on the preferences.
2016-04-14T14:36:44 <akshay> It would be showing those in a couple of hours as I\'m presently working on it.
2016-04-14T14:41:55 <cindyli> u know what, Katy_, i don\'t find a wiki page solely for oauth2orize, although it appears here and there. if you have another candidate, we can start drafting one as what we are doing for the user management system
2016-04-14T14:41:58 <Justin_o> akshay: sounds interesting.. thanks
2016-04-14T14:42:18 <cindyli> having a look at uaa...
2016-04-14T14:43:26 <Katy_> cindyli  oauth2orize is fine as long as it is a well established, well tested, and it will be around in the future with the latest updates for new security hacks.
2016-04-14T14:45:45 <cindyli> ok, Katy_. btw, do you know benefits with https://github.com/cloudfoundry/uaa
2016-04-14T14:46:54 <cindyli> Katy_: seems it\'s not a node.js app but can be run as a standalone server
2016-04-14T14:47:20 <cindyli> just for oauth authentication
2016-04-14T14:48:25 <cindyli> in today\'s meeting, we can go thru the GPII requirements for the auth server to find out if this server satisfies those requirements, Katy_
2016-04-14T14:50:27 <Katy_> cindli.  Yes uaa ,  is a oauth2 standalone authorization server.  Not a node.js.    It handles the tokens and authorizations.   Won\'t the gpii authorization server be a standalone or is it part of the gpii app?
2016-04-14T14:51:25 <cindyli> Katy_: yes, gpii auth server can be a standalone server
2016-04-14T14:52:19 <cindyli> Katy_: it also needs to be able to interact with the flow manager to provide certain information. we can go thru those later in the meeting
2016-04-14T14:53:34 <Katy_> cindyli Sounds good.  Once we go through the code flow, I will understand the security better.
2016-04-14T14:53:47 <cindyli> cool. thanks, Katy_
