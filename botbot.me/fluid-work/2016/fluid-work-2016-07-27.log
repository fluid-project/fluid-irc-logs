2016-07-27T16:43:03 <jhernandez> kasparnet: wrt makeConfigurable, JFYI I made some ahead development and orca is almost ready to use the isConfigurable and makeConfigurable :)
2016-07-27T16:43:25 <kasparnet> that's awesome jhernandez
2016-07-27T16:43:51 <kasparnet> right now, I've only tried it with very simple lifecycle functions that I've created
2016-07-27T16:44:04 <jhernandez> https://github.com/GPII/linux/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/orca/orcaSettingsHandler.js#L77
2016-07-27T16:44:07 <kasparnet> such as checking that a file is presetn, and creating a file with some string content
2016-07-27T16:44:33 <jhernandez> great
2016-07-27T16:44:36 <kasparnet> oooh nice
2016-07-27T16:44:44 <jhernandez> this is what I'm already doing in there
2016-07-27T16:46:39 <jhernandez> also , it has passed through ANTVANIQUE, so I guess that is a good template/approach for you to use ;)

2016-07-27T14:02:57 <colinclark> morning, Justin_o
2016-07-27T14:03:07 <Justin_o> colinclark: good morning
2016-07-27T14:03:25 <clown> the-t-in-rtf:  no problem and not a big deal.  I was going to be a fly on the wall, so to speak.
2016-07-27T14:03:29 <clown> But, I\'ll pat myself on the back for reminding you ;-)
2016-07-27T14:03:32 * kasparnet joined the channel
2016-07-27T14:03:34 <Justin_o> here are some of the metrics i gathered for the UIO / Prefs Framework optimization.. the new stuff is the lazy loading of the page enhancer https://cdn.rawgit.com/jobara/prefsFramework-optimization-examples/debd1f6ac6da992b9368bd144d0e97c879331f21/index.html
2016-07-27T14:03:50 <avtar> clown, the-t-in-rtf: thanks :)
2016-07-27T14:04:35 <Justin_o> colinclark: ^^
2016-07-27T14:05:37 <the-t-in-rtf> I\'m trying to invite you to the event, Joseph, but I don\'t have you as a contact (except in IRC)
2016-07-27T14:05:40 <Justin_o> colinclark: the long times for the lazy loading without prefs set are mostly because of the idle time. I believe that\'s related to the chrome timeline feature waiting to see if anything else was going to happen
2016-07-27T14:05:48 <the-t-in-rtf> Avtar, can you add him to the event in a minute?
2016-07-27T14:06:02 <jhernandez> Justin_o: hey, yeah, I wanted to, but I can\'t make it today, been dealing with other business :/  - let\'s talk on the next week
2016-07-27T14:06:27 <Justin_o> jhernandez: no problem, ping me next week when you\'d like to chat.
2016-07-27T14:06:41 <avtar> the-t-in-rtf: i have clown\'s work email address but not a gmail one
2016-07-27T14:06:45 <avtar> otherwise, yes, i can add him
2016-07-27T14:06:56 <styki> Hello everybody. I\'m trying to implement a new feature to the UI options that changes the intensity of the blue color. The problem that I am facing has to with the fact that I have to select every element in the DOM tree and then change its color. However, the table of content changes the DOM, so I have to fire my filter function after the toc model has changed and its apply function has finished.
2016-07-27T14:07:19 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, you could also just stand at his desk five minutes before.
2016-07-27T14:07:38 <clown> avtar:  does it need a gmail account?  If so clown.idi@gmail.com
2016-07-27T14:08:12 <the-t-in-rtf> Well, the GPII Public calendar I used for the invite is a gcal one, so it\'s handy.
2016-07-27T14:08:14 <jhung> Justin_o, styki  - is there a way to listen for changes to the DOM so the blue filter knows to update itself?
2016-07-27T14:08:44 <Justin_o> jhung: you should be able to add observers for DOM changes
2016-07-27T14:08:58 <the-t-in-rtf> I guess I would tend to apply a single class to a container element like body and have CSS rules that change the color.
2016-07-27T14:09:03 <the-t-in-rtf> that way you have one change to make?
2016-07-27T14:09:05 <avtar> clown: google calendar yells at me when someone invites me using my work address because i\'m usually signed into google services using my gmail address
2016-07-27T14:09:26 <Justin_o> jhung, styki: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver
2016-07-27T14:09:27 <the-t-in-rtf> But I guess you\'re talking about a dynamic value\xe2\x80\xa6 :)
2016-07-27T14:09:49 <alanharnum> Justin_o: those metrics are interesting
2016-07-27T14:09:52 <the-t-in-rtf> OK, invite sent.
2016-07-27T14:10:01 <colinclark> I\'ll take a look, Justin_o\xe2\x80\x94I\'m just in a meeting now
2016-07-27T14:10:09 <alanharnum> if i\'m interpreting them correctly it looks like the bulk of everything is scripting time
2016-07-27T14:10:21 <jhernandez> Justin_o: sure, I\'ll send a doodle poll with my availability ;)
2016-07-27T14:10:44 <Justin_o> colinclark: no problem.. you may also want to take a look at the implementation too.
2016-07-27T14:10:53 <alanharnum> and the main saving from lazy loading is reducing how much of that needs to happen before the "Finish"
2016-07-27T14:10:53 <Justin_o> alanharnum: which one are you looking at?
2016-07-27T14:11:13 <alanharnum> separated panel
2016-07-27T14:11:30 <Justin_o> jhernandez: sounds good
2016-07-27T14:12:12 <styki> Justin_o thanks I will have a look.
2016-07-27T14:13:14 * bens__ has quit
2016-07-27T14:13:21 <alanharnum> the other thing i wonder about (if I\'m reading this right) is why scripting time seems to go up significantly if it\'s serving one large file (even a minified one) vs. individual ones
2016-07-27T14:14:09 <alanharnum> that seems counterintuitive to me
2016-07-27T14:15:15 <Justin_o> alanharnum: the two infusion-all cases include all of infusion so it\'s reading in more code
2016-07-27T14:15:30 <alanharnum> ah
2016-07-27T14:15:32 <Justin_o> alanharnum: the individual source and the infusion-custom builds bring in less
2016-07-27T14:15:44 <alanharnum> that makes sense
2016-07-27T14:16:50 <Justin_o> alanharnum: even the infusion custom builds bring in extra JS over the source builds as you get all the variant prefs editors and probably other things that you wouldn\'t include in a vary targeted source build
2016-07-27T14:19:10 <clown> avtar:  ask google to stop yelling at you.  :-)
2016-07-27T14:19:36 <clown> the irony is that the only attendant in the invite that has a gmail address is me.
2016-07-27T14:19:38 <alanharnum> i wonder what goes into that "scripting" metric
2016-07-27T14:19:47 <alanharnum> does it include time spent loading resources files by scripts, etc

2016-07-27T14:57:36 <clown> avtar:  newbie question:  when I \'vagrant up\' my windows vm, I\'m not getting a message that the licence will expire soon.
2016-07-27T14:57:44 <clown> Do I simply destroy the VM and then the next \'vagrant up\' re-creates it?

2016-07-27T15:03:40 <avtar> clown: when you run \'vagrant up\' a new vm or instance is created of the vm disk image (or vagrant box) that exists on your file system
2016-07-27T15:04:22 <avtar> when you download a new updated vagrant box then vagrant up will create new instances of the new disk image
2016-07-27T15:05:29 <avtar> we build and release new windows 10 boxes every 90 days to comply with microsoft\'s licensing terms
2016-07-27T15:06:01 <clown> avtar:  is the bottom line that I just keep doing "vagrant up" and no worries?
2016-07-27T15:06:10 <avtar> yup
2016-07-27T15:06:22 <clown> cool.  thanks
