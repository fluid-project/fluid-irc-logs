b"2016-10-19T17:55:51 <Justin_o> Kobi: The questions you are referring to are the ones at the bottom of your doc?
2016-10-19T17:56:18 <Kobi> Yeah, those are the new ones, along with some of the questions we discussed yesterday
2016-10-19T17:56:28 <Kobi> Justin_o: ^
2016-10-19T17:57:16 <Justin_o> Kobi: i like the questions section it's starting to get at what the content will have to answer.
2016-10-19T18:00:20 <David123_> ok
2016-10-19T18:01:17 <Justin_o> Kobi, David123_: so once you've established all the questions, and you may come back to these again later, you may want to start to think of how best to answer those based on who the OER is for, and the Goals you've outlined.
2016-10-19T18:03:07 <Kobi> Justin_o: OK. I think they're almost like placeholder questions, and I'm trying to write down as many as I can so we have more to pick from later on. Thanks
2016-10-19T18:03:52 <Justin_o> Kobi: sure, it's good to think about it from lots of angles.. maybe write down all the questions you and David123_ have regarding the topic and the questions that others have asked you.
2016-10-19T18:05:25 <Kobi> Justin_o: I was thinking that was what the page on the document was for, but I'm able to write them down too.

2016-10-19T14:43:19 <cindyli> no details reported by clicking on the "details" link. shall it be cancelled?
2016-10-19T14:45:31 <gtirloni> cindyli: nullpointer exception in jenkins. it looks like the job failed midway through. could you add \'ok to test\' and see if it triggers a new build?
2016-10-19T14:45:43 <cindyli> sure
2016-10-19T14:54:21 * alanharnum joined the channel

2016-10-19T15:01:15 <Justin_o> cindyli: sure, call me when you\'re ready

2016-10-19T15:09:04 <cindyli> Justin_o: actually the issue with the inline edit tooltip is also covered by the same jira https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5980
2016-10-19T15:09:19 <cindyli> as it says: Inline edit instructions and tooltip overlap the input field
2016-10-19T15:09:59 <Justin_o> cindyli: okay, i\'ll take a look at that as well then
2016-10-19T15:10:11 <Justin_o> can you leave a comment about it on the PR too please?
2016-10-19T15:10:14 <Justin_o> cindyli: ^
2016-10-19T15:10:46 <cindyli> sure, thanks, Justin_o, btw, i cannot reproduce two same tooltips showing at the same tiem

2016-10-19T15:33:32 <Bosmon2> Hi there gtirloni - I\'m wondering whether our CI bot is snoozing again
2016-10-19T15:33:41 <Bosmon2> I have added "ok to test" to this pull, but it doesn\'t seem to care: https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/95
2016-10-19T15:33:44 * Bosmon2 is now known as Bosmon
2016-10-19T15:42:20 * Jess_ has quit
2016-10-19T15:45:30 <gtirloni> Bosmon: we tried to setup github hooks to jenkins would be alerted of new comments but the plugin used to make that work had some bugs and it didn\'t work. the only way avtar got it to work was by polling GH every 5min so there is a delay
2016-10-19T15:45:54 <gtirloni> i see it\'s running now https://ci.gpii.net/job/windows-tests/71/
2016-10-19T15:51:45 <Justin_o> Bosmon: not sure if you saw my e-mail and ping in the channel yesterday. We are hoping to have all the PRs in by the end of the week for the Infusion 2.0 release. There are quite a few on your plate both for review and ones that you have submitted. The ones from the fluid-publish and infusion-docs repos could probably wait till next, if you don\'t have time
2016-10-19T15:51:45 <Justin_o> for those. Also if you need me to re-assign any of your reviews please let me know.

2016-10-19T16:13:54 <Justin_o> Bosmon: sort of, you mentioned that you need to submit a docs pull for FLUID-5903, but I don\'t think you made a PR for that one yet
2016-10-19T16:14:05 <Bosmon> ok
2016-10-19T16:14:16 <Justin_o> otherwise only reviews for infusion-docs and fluid-publish
2016-10-19T16:14:29 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks
2016-10-19T16:40:28 <cindyli> gtirloni: the CI job failed on my pull request https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/464. the report shows it fails on running web tests. however, i cannot reproduce the issue locally with either my local browser or vagrant. I wonder if you could give it a try when you have time

2016-10-19T17:13:30 <Justin_o> Kobi, David123_: i\'ll be online till the end of the community meeting, so if you have any questions or concerns, or just need to talk over some points, feel free to message me.
2016-10-19T17:13:47 <Justin_o> you can also chat with others here or in the office if you want to talk through something

2016-10-19T17:20:48 <Justin_o> michelled1: and am waiting on either more tests or an explanation on why they aren\'t needed for the FLUID-5982 PR
2016-10-19T17:22:40 <michelled1> Justin_o: do you have a sense of how long the changes for FLUID-5980 will take?
2016-10-19T17:23:43 <Justin_o> michelled1: not really, i was hoping it would be quick but it\'s taking a bit longer to sort through the code. I think i\'ve found the issue at least, which is that the tooltip is positioned to the size of the element it is bound to, but that element\'s contents are changed, so it is positioned incorrectly.
