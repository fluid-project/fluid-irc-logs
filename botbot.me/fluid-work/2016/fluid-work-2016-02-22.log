b"2016-02-22T19:39:13 <Justin_o> i think this is the first time using it since upgrading to windows 10 so i'm hoping it's just a driver issue
2016-02-22T19:39:36 <colinclark> Did our vendor upgrade the cart to Windows 10?
2016-02-22T19:41:03 <gtirloni> not sure. i think etgroup visited the office to check on some issues in the collab room? i saw an email from them scheduling a visit but i don't know the details
2016-02-22T19:41:45 <gtirloni> re: the cart. if it's nothing something we can easily fix, we should definitely open a support request. i'm not sure about win10 support though, i would have to look it up.
2016-02-22T19:47:21 <alanharnum> vidyo itself seemed OK on the cart
2016-02-22T19:47:44 <alanharnum> i think the main issue was with the microphone / speaker

2016-02-22T13:57:03 <Justin_o> in github
2016-02-22T13:57:26 <Justin_o> always, if you type chrome://accessibility into your chrome browser you can view the a11y tree it builds
2016-02-22T13:57:56 <jhung> that\'s handy Justin_o. I wasn\'t aware of that.

2016-02-22T15:28:16 <danayo> sure Justin_o
2016-02-22T15:28:42 <Justin_o> danayo: thanks, could you open this link in chrome http://first-discovery.mybluemix.net/demos/prefsServerIntegration/index.html?preview=electron
2016-02-22T15:29:21 <danayo> yes
2016-02-22T15:29:32 <Justin_o> I\'m retesting the fixed issues, currently I\'m on Test 2: of the State Tests from the First Discovery tab in https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JfKcgOlVzeTFDZMQLsAEVHajag4UeVeFwb3dDFL5gzY/edit#gid=1389585189
2016-02-22T15:29:47 <Justin_o> danayo: ^
2016-02-22T15:30:03 <Justin_o> danayo: it seems to me that they fixed the issue by making the hover and focus styling be the same
2016-02-22T15:32:53 <danayo> I see what you mean Justin_o
2016-02-22T15:36:14 <danayo> Justin_o also, at some point somehow I got it to voice "select to view electrons preview" but I can\'t get it to repeat
2016-02-22T15:36:27 <danayo> and the focus on the language group is odd
2016-02-22T15:36:37 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2016-02-22T15:36:54 <danayo> the blue frame around the group I mean Justin_o

2016-02-22T15:38:41 <Justin_o> danayo: haven\'t heard "select to view electrons preview" if you figure out how to get that we might need to file that.
2016-02-22T15:38:58 * sepidehshahi has quit
2016-02-22T15:38:59 <Justin_o> danayo: for the blue focus, you mean on shift-tab
2016-02-22T15:39:00 <Justin_o> ?
2016-02-22T15:39:31 <danayo> ah yes, it\'s only on shift-tab
2016-02-22T15:40:21 <Justin_o> danayo: i guess we should mention that too, and they can decide if they want to do anything about it
2016-02-22T15:40:43 <danayo> yeah, I think it\'s pretty confusing Justin_o
2016-02-22T15:40:53 <Justin_o> danayo: what do you think about hover and focus styling on the self voicing toggle being the same?
2016-02-22T15:41:04 <Justin_o> from what i can see it\'s different for the other controls
2016-02-22T15:41:16 <danayo> yes, it should be consistent with all the others Justin_o
2016-02-22T15:41:31 <Justin_o> danayo: cool thanks
2016-02-22T15:41:44 * colinclark joined the channel
2016-02-22T15:41:57 <danayo> and I\'ll try to get it to read "select to view electrons preveiw" again - so strange - it seemed to be some combo of hover and focus in the upper right corner of the tool
2016-02-22T15:42:05 <danayo> Justin_o ^
2016-02-22T15:43:04 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2016-02-22T15:43:51 <bens1> danayo, Justin_o, i\'m following that voicing one.. could it have been "select to navigate to electrons page"  ? We have that in a messages file
2016-02-22T15:44:50 <danayo> yes bens1 - I just realised I must have hovered over the preview itself - the Electrons link
2016-02-22T15:45:07 <danayo> I thought I was hovering over the tool somewhere, but I dont\' think so
2016-02-22T15:45:51 <danayo> Justin_o ^
2016-02-22T15:46:16 <bens1> in the electron preview breadcrumbs there is "Physical Science -> Electrons"
2016-02-22T15:46:25 <bens1> might be the TTS on the "Electrons" breadcrumb there
