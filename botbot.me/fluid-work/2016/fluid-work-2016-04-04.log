2016-04-04T19:04:26 <colinclark> in that it is very visual
2016-04-04T19:04:28 <colinclark> lots of graphics
2016-04-04T19:04:55 <colinclark> and being able to draw a relationship between the "pictures" and actual sounds--making it interactive--would be very useful

2016-04-04T19:45:56 <cindyli> simonjb: i have a couple of questions when looking at https://wiki.gpii.net/w/GPII_Security_Plan#User_accounts. one is "Support multiple preference sets and tokens per user". i understand the necessity of supporting multiple prefs sets which can be used for different devices and contexts. But why would one user be assigned multiple tokens?
2016-04-04T19:46:19 <cindyli> maybe i don\'t know enough of "gpii tokens"
2016-04-04T19:47:37 <cindyli> my understanding was, once a user is created, an gpii token (likely an UUID) would be assigned to this user. This token is used internally to retrieve this person\'s prefs sets. and all prefs sets are associated with this one token
2016-04-04T19:48:23 <simonjb> cindyli: yes, at the moment we have one gpii token per user
2016-04-04T19:48:50 <simonjb> but in the past we have discussed extending that so that a single user could have multiple tokens
2016-04-04T19:49:32 <simonjb> in terms of use case, the thinking was to be able to support tokens with different preference sets that could be used in different circumstances
2016-04-04T19:50:00 <simonjb> for example, one token with less sensitive info that could be used in fairly public situations
2016-04-04T19:50:37 <simonjb> and another with more sensitive preferences which might only be used in cases where the user has a higher degree of trust in the device they are interacting with
2016-04-04T19:51:06 <simonjb> now, this is for sure related to authentication mechanisms and strength
2016-04-04T19:51:25 <colinclark> Also, if I\'m remembering correctly, simonjb, having multiple tokens means you could revoke one
2016-04-04T19:51:25 <cindyli> simonjb: i see. this is still on our plan for the future development, right?
2016-04-04T19:51:32 <colinclark> like if you left your USB stick connected to the computer
2016-04-04T19:51:49 <simonjb> yes, that\'s right colinclark
2016-04-04T19:52:29 <cindyli> thanks simonjb & colinclark, i will add this clarification to the wiki
2016-04-04T19:52:30 * Blagoj joined the channel
2016-04-04T19:52:51 <colinclark> I\'d say we definitely need this feature as soon as we can feasibly implement it
2016-04-04T19:54:05 <simonjb> thanks cindyli
2016-04-04T19:54:52 <cindyli> simonjb, colinclark: another question is about "Provision tokens", i guess this is related to the case we just talked about - "one user has multiple tokens", meaning, every token should be defined/provisioned for certain things/sensitivities?
2016-04-04T19:56:19 <simonjb> yes, I think that\'s right cindyli -- and as colinclark said revoked (de-provisioned) individually
2016-04-04T19:56:31 <cindyli> cool. thanks guys
2016-04-04T19:57:52 <cindyli> simonjb, colinclark, does this mean other than user roles, we also need token roles to classify tokens?
2016-04-04T19:58:56 <simonjb> good question cindyli, I think that seems reasonable, yes
2016-04-04T19:59:17 <cindyli> great. thanks, simonjb.

2016-04-04T13:18:01 <Justin_o> I wasn't able to reproduce the original issue at all, see https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5874
2016-04-04T13:18:41 <jhung> ok Justin_o let me look.
2016-04-04T13:23:25 <jhung> Interesting Justin_o. I was able to reproduce this a week ago, but it seems to have been fixed. Perhaps another pull req. fixed this?
2016-04-04T13:23:46 <Justin_o> jhung: could be, or a browser update
2016-04-04T13:24:03 <jhung> The issue was the text in the columns were getting clipped as the font size changed.
2016-04-04T13:24:07 <Justin_o> jhung: if you aren't able to reproduce it could you follow up with Awesome_A to see if he still can
2016-04-04T13:24:25 <jhung> sure
2016-04-04T13:25:04 <Justin_o> jhung: thanks
2016-04-04T13:25:30 <Justin_o> jhung and Awesome_A: could you also make sure that the steps to reproduce are clear and accurate in the JIRA description.
2016-04-04T13:26:56 <Awesome_A> OK
2016-04-04T13:27:06 <Justin_o> Awesome_A: thanks
2016-04-04T13:27:16 <jhung> Awesome_A: if I recall correctly, the steps to reproduce were: 1. Load the UIOptions demo (http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/uiOptions/)
2016-04-04T13:27:25 <jhung> 2. Change to the default theme.
2016-04-04T13:27:36 <jhung> 3. Increase the text size using the UIO slider.
2016-04-04T13:27:58 <jhung> 4. See the text in the first column getting clipped by the second column.
2016-04-04T13:28:43 <jhung> Does that look like the right steps to reproduce Awesome_A?
2016-04-04T13:30:08 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2016-04-04T13:30:12 <Awesome_A> Well it seems the issue has been solved, may be it's browser update
2016-04-04T13:30:52 <jhung> Awesome_A: Thanks for checking. We should still update the description of the issue to make sure it documents the right procedure before we close the bug.
2016-04-04T13:31:15 <jhung> Sometimes bugs come up again, so it's good to have them well documented just in case.
