b'2016-08-25T16:20:19 <bens___> so.. in the edgejs PR that I need to update still... i think we have a good base upon which to expand for other things that could use edge/.net
2016-08-25T16:20:22 * colinclark joined the channel
2016-08-25T16:21:18 <bens___> gloob, do you have settings handlers in mind already? i have some sketches of a few for high contrast.. sticky keys
2016-08-25T16:21:50 <gloob> bens___: I was thinking for a custom app that should be integrated into gpii
2016-08-25T16:23:41 <bens___> gloob, so a custom AT app? like a screen reader?

2016-08-25T16:25:11 <gloob> anyway it is an example of things we should onboard or allow to onboard for third parties
2016-08-25T16:25:26 <gloob> so I\'m wondering how to create a mechanism to easily integrated with us

2016-08-25T16:33:16 * simonjb joined the channel
2016-08-25T16:33:57 <bens___> gloob, so for this example, a user with a preference of "use_virtual_mouse_webcam=true" logs in, we do some match making, etc, then we need to 1. launch the eviacam.exe and pass that process some settings such as sensitivity.. maybe help with calibration?
2016-08-25T16:35:39 <gloob> yes, mostly
2016-08-25T16:44:33 <bens___> gloob, .net can facilitate some of that.. certainly launching. just reading the docs on eviacam it seems you need to use the mouse to calibrate the tool

2016-08-25T19:46:37 <kavya> i would like to know the process to set up VM with preferences server and flow manager in production environment
2016-08-25T19:47:04 <kavya> do we have any documentation?
2016-08-25T19:47:59 <avtar> kavya: at the moment the necessary bits for that live in cindyli1\'s fork of universal in the following branch: https://github.com/cindyli/universal/tree/GPII-1821/examples/production-components-vm
2016-08-25T19:49:14 * gtirloni joined the channel
2016-08-25T19:49:15 <avtar> we got the environment set up to the point where the two components get deployed but i believe cindyli1 mentioned there are some flow manager config related issues remaining
2016-08-25T19:50:06 <cindyli1> that\'s true, kavya
2016-08-25T19:50:14 <cindyli1> working on it
2016-08-25T19:50:30 <kavya> ok..:)
2016-08-25T19:51:01 <kavya> is there any other way i can test ?

2016-08-25T19:54:00 <kavya> thanks avtar.. cindy
2016-08-25T19:55:17 <avtar> kavya: np
2016-08-25T19:55:30 <avtar> once all lights are green i\'ll update the meager docs in that directory with more details but for now typing \'vagrant up\' in that location will give you access to a preferences server on port 8081

2016-08-25T20:32:27 <cindyli> hi Bosmon, Bosmon7, do you have a few minutes to chat with simon and me?
2016-08-25T20:33:13 <cindyli> about whether gpii acceptance tests should use a separate instance of pouchdb than the one coming from the dev config
2016-08-25T20:33:49 <Bosmon7> Hi there cindyli
2016-08-25T20:33:53 <Bosmon7> What do you mean by "instance"?
2016-08-25T20:34:16 <cindyli> it\'s more like the configuration
2016-08-25T20:34:21 <Bosmon7> yes
2016-08-25T20:34:30 <Bosmon7> They should use a different one, yes
2016-08-25T20:34:40 <Bosmon7> Because the dev config should persist, and the acceptance tests shouldn\'t
2016-08-25T20:34:50 <Bosmon7> But that only means "different" to that extent
2016-08-25T20:35:30 <cindyli> ok

2016-08-25T20:48:35 <cindyli> Bosmon, Bosmon7, probably i didn\'t make my above question clear, going to paste some code to make sure we are on the same picture. in order to have pouchdb support for the gpii dev environment, now we have this code in the dev config file: https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/GPII-1821/gpii/configs/gpii.config.cloudBased.development.all.local.json#L19
2016-08-25T20:48:45 <cindyli> as u can see it instantiates a pouchdb instance
2016-08-25T20:49:43 <cindyli> within our acceptance test, we have a separate pouchdb instance being instantiated in the test case holder for handling pouch requests: https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/GPII-1821/gpii/node_modules/testing/src/PouchTestCaseHolder.js#L49
2016-08-25T20:50:07 <cindyli> the acceptance tests were done before having the new dev config
2016-08-25T20:50:57 <cindyli> so, now when running acceptance tests, there would be 2 pouchdb instances, one is running in the gpii kettle server, the other is in the test case holder
2016-08-25T20:52:12 <cindyli> the latter is used to handle pouchdb request sent by acceptance tests
2016-08-25T20:54:47 <cindyli> do you think it\'s worthwhile to get rid of the pouchdb instance in the test case holder by only using the kettle server one when running acceptance tests?
2016-08-25T20:56:08 <gloob> kavya: did you try to install our windows instance?
2016-08-25T20:56:25 <gloob> at least it is a good test bed for intall all the dependencies, vagrant and that stuff
2016-08-25T20:56:47 <simonjb> I think it\'s good to only have a single PouchDB instance running during the acceptance tests
2016-08-25T20:57:21 <simonjb> And we could do that by changing the acceptance tests to use the PouchDB defined by the dev config as you suggest cindyli
2016-08-25T20:58:16 <simonjb> Another approach would be to continue with the existing acceptance test structure with the PouchDB managed at the test case holder but rework the configs so that we don\'t have the dev one also running
2016-08-25T20:59:44 <cindyli> simonjb: does the 2nd approach mean to override the pouchdb subcomopnent in the dev config to be an empty subcomponent?
2016-08-25T21:00:32 * sepidehshahi has left the channel
2016-08-25T21:00:43 <kavya> gloob: i have installed https://github.com/GPII/windows
2016-08-25T21:01:03 <simonjb> either that or change the config inclusion structure so that the part that specifies the dev PouchDB doesn\'t get used by the acceptance test config
2016-08-25T21:01:45 <simonjb> that would involve some config refactoring
2016-08-25T21:01:58 * bens___ has quit

2016-08-25T21:11:55 <Bosmon7> simonjb\'s suggestion is better
2016-08-25T21:12:02 <Bosmon7> Our config inclusion structure has been deficient for years
2016-08-25T21:12:12 <Bosmon7> I could only improve it a little in my recent pull
2016-08-25T21:12:18 <Bosmon7> Creation of "flowManager.local" etc.
2016-08-25T21:15:18 <cindyli> Bosmon7: if we have a separate config file for the pouchdb running in dev, shall we test it to make sure views work fine etc
2016-08-25T21:15:40 <Bosmon7> cindyli - many of these configs will end up being "abstract"
2016-08-25T21:15:51 <Bosmon7> That is, they don\'t designate enough structure to create a running system
2016-08-25T21:17:08 <cindyli> right. but do we need to verify that config is correct even though it\'s only included when it\'s needed, Bosmon7

2016-08-25T13:38:53 <cindyli> the-t-in-rtf: i was thinking what's the proper way to fix GPII acceptance tests that were failed by have 2 pouchdb instances. Thanks for letting me know that gpii-pouchdb support running multiple pouchdb instances. But I think since the pouchdb instantiated by the dev config is a part of the dev environment, it should also be tested in the acceptance tests. so, the proper way might be to get rid of the pouchdb instantiated in the testing e
2016-08-25T13:41:36 <the-t-in-rtf> I'm still not sure what the conflict is.
2016-08-25T13:41:50 <the-t-in-rtf> You should be able to have 100 instances running at the same time, as long as they use different ports and directories.
2016-08-25T13:42:09 <the-t-in-rtf> What kind of errors are you seeing?
2016-08-25T13:42:16 <the-t-in-rtf> Also, good morning, @cindyli!
2016-08-25T13:43:03 <cindyli> the-t-in-rtf: mainly 'cuz they were using the same port
2016-08-25T13:43:13 <cindyli> and good afternoon
2016-08-25T13:44:23 <cindyli> and the same dbPath
2016-08-25T13:44:38 <the-t-in-rtf> well, the port is super easy to override.
2016-08-25T13:45:27 <the-t-in-rtf> why is the dbPath the same?
2016-08-25T13:46:08 <the-t-in-rtf> I mean, if these are acceptance tests, why can't they just use the default behavior of using a unique dir per instance?
2016-08-25T13:47:16 <cindyli> they certainly can use the default behavior, actually after looking more in the code, they are using since there's no predefined dbPath for pouchdb used by the acceptance tests
2016-08-25T13:47:19 * yzen joined the channel
2016-08-25T13:48:27 <cindyli> but i think the proper way is to test the actually dev pouchdb, with overriding dbPath and data set when using it for the acceptance tests
2016-08-25T13:48:46 <cindyli> so we can test this pouchdb does work with other parts of the dev config

2016-08-25T13:49:14 <cindyli> instead of defining a different pouchdb instance

2016-08-25T16:09:02 <gloob> this is on my hands
2016-08-25T16:09:34 <gloob> you can have a windows10 32bits soon
2016-08-25T16:09:53 <gloob> 7 is not being as straightforward as I expected
2016-08-25T16:09:57 <gloob> the main question is
2016-08-25T16:10:01 <gloob> when do you need it kavya ?
2016-08-25T16:11:51 <kavya> :).. I need it once installer is ready
2016-08-25T16:12:26 <kavya> right now am writng down on steps to how to achieve multi platform gpii installer testing
2016-08-25T16:14:03 <gloob> ok, well, in that case you have a gpii issue to refer that is blocking that
2016-08-25T16:14:05 <kavya> I am expecting installer by mid september
2016-08-25T16:14:08 <gloob> please link to it

2016-08-25T16:15:23 <bens___> gloob, howdy!
2016-08-25T16:16:19 <gloob> bens___: how are you doing? did you reroll your PR?
2016-08-25T16:17:11 <bens___> gloob, not yet, hope to do so before the weekend
2016-08-25T16:17:13 <gloob> I ask because I'm thinking how to implement the settings listeners for some of the at tools in the onboarding process
2016-08-25T16:17:46 <gloob> I think it is pretty open the question yet, but implement it in .net using your beast looks really promising and easy
2016-08-25T16:17:53 <bens___> gloob, are you thinking in .net/edge?
2016-08-25T16:17:57 <gloob> yep
2016-08-25T16:18:07 <gloob> at least, like an option
2016-08-25T16:18:18 <bens___> gloob, i see
2016-08-25T16:18:48 <bens___> gloob, settings... listeners? are these different than handlers?
2016-08-25T16:19:01 <gloob> sorry, settings handlers
2016-08-25T16:19:14 <bens___> oh - ok - i follow
2016-08-25T16:19:14 <gloob> I was thinking in the user/device listeners
2016-08-25T16:19:16 <gloob> I mixed it
