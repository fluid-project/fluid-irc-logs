b"2016-02-12T23:44:38 <colinclark> and yes, I'll join you in a second
2016-02-12T23:44:54 <avtar> yes it's in there
2016-02-12T23:44:58 <avtar> under the same name
2016-02-12T23:45:17 <colinclark> I love JIRA
2016-02-12T23:45:20 <colinclark> I just love it
2016-02-12T23:46:26 * yzen_ has quit
"

b'2016-02-12T21:55:41 <alanharnum> implications for scenarios such as responsive web design and animation."
2016-02-12T21:55:49 <alanharnum> lose sentence #3 entirely, perhaps?
2016-02-12T21:56:34 <colinclark> jhung: Do we have anywhere in the ILDH that talks about responsive design and its advantages?
2016-02-12T21:57:56 <alanharnum> colinclark: I\'m not jhung, but a quick project search says no
2016-02-12T21:58:00 <colinclark> ok
2016-02-12T21:58:09 <colinclark> I was thinking, alanharnum, that there\'s some advantage to mentioning it if we have a page that talks about what responsive design is and why it\'s useful
2016-02-12T21:58:17 <colinclark> I guess that\'s a new feature we can add some day :)
2016-02-12T21:58:20 <alanharnum> i can spike sentence #3 if we want to keep it focused on inclusive design
2016-02-12T21:58:40 <alanharnum> i mention animation / simulation scenarios further down
2016-02-12T21:58:43 <colinclark> ok
2016-02-12T21:58:46 <colinclark> that sounds fine then
2016-02-12T21:59:02 <jhung> catching up on the discussiong alanharnum, colinclark
2016-02-12T21:59:10 <colinclark> cool, take your time
2016-02-12T21:59:29 <alanharnum> writing this up has reminded me how exciting i find SVG when I spend time actually looking at it
2016-02-12T22:00:02 <colinclark> :)
2016-02-12T22:00:19 <colinclark> I\'m imagining that, for pages in the ILDH that present primarily technical content
2016-02-12T22:00:24 <colinclark> i.e. specific accessibility techniques
2016-02-12T22:00:26 <jhung> alanharnum: re responsive design - for now we can link to a decent reference until we can give our own inclusive spin on it.
2016-02-12T22:00:53 <colinclark> we\'ll want to aim to have an introductory paragraph that always describes "the point" of the page from a non-technical perspective
2016-02-12T22:01:26 <colinclark> if you imagine someone who might not read the whole page, but who can read the first paragraph and say "Ah, I get what this is about" even if they themselves will never use the techniques further down
2016-02-12T22:01:38 <alanharnum> the description of vector graphics in pure XML, as much as SVG is a huge complicated spec (it kinda has to be), is really important for transformation and flexibility and alternative formats
2016-02-12T22:02:15 <simonjb> colinclark: and they might point others more interested in the technical content to the page
2016-02-12T22:02:20 <colinclark> yes, exactly
2016-02-12T22:02:31 <colinclark> precisely
2016-02-12T22:02:40 <alanharnum> yeah, we had responses like that from people at Open Ed
2016-02-12T22:02:48 <alanharnum> "oh, i\'ll point our developers at this"
2016-02-12T22:02:54 <simonjb> yeah, that
2016-02-12T22:03:16 <colinclark> I think to a certain extent, we still have that problem with the Chart Authoring 1-pager
2016-02-12T22:03:18 <colinclark> which I really like
2016-02-12T22:03:21 <simonjb> or, "I know someone who would find this helpful"
2016-02-12T22:03:26 <colinclark> yes
2016-02-12T22:03:33 <colinclark> and which you shouldn\'t sweat until you\'re back from vacation
2016-02-12T22:03:40 <alanharnum> god i\'m sweating it now
2016-02-12T22:03:46 <colinclark> hahaha
2016-02-12T22:03:46 <alanharnum> VACATION CANCELLED
2016-02-12T22:03:50 <colinclark> NOOOOOOO
2016-02-12T22:03:51 <alanharnum> WORKING ALL WEEKEND
2016-02-12T22:03:58 <colinclark> but I was thinking we should have, among other things, an image of the chart authoring tool
2016-02-12T22:04:05 <alanharnum> i actually just added that
2016-02-12T22:04:08 <colinclark> ah nice
2016-02-12T22:04:10 <alanharnum> https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Chart+Authoring+Introduction
2016-02-12T22:04:13 <colinclark> read my mind :)
2016-02-12T22:04:19 <colinclark> thanks, alanharnum
2016-02-12T22:04:24 <alanharnum> i cleaned up some of the wording, linked up everything that should be linked, added an image
2016-02-12T22:04:29 <colinclark> and somehow I feel like we need to get at what the problem is
2016-02-12T22:04:42 <colinclark> how traditional data visualization excludes some learners
2016-02-12T22:04:52 <alanharnum> it\'s a little tricky to express because it\'s so experimental
2016-02-12T22:04:55 <colinclark> either due to disability or to learning style or environment etc.
2016-02-12T22:05:03 <colinclark> well, I guess that\'s the point
2016-02-12T22:05:15 <alanharnum> and some of what we\'re doing is probing the limits of where this is valuable
2016-02-12T22:05:23 <alanharnum> but maybe that\'s all we need to say for now
2016-02-12T22:05:50 <simonjb> colinclark: I
2016-02-12T22:06:07 <simonjb> am going to head home soon, are there things we should discuss?
2016-02-12T22:06:12 <colinclark> simonjb: You tell me
2016-02-12T22:06:28 <jhung> @simonjb, alanharnum - Jonathan Blow (game designer / The Witness) is doing an AMA on Reddit right now. https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/45fu74/i_am_jonathan_blow_game_development_person_ask_me/
2016-02-12T22:06:32 <colinclark> I can be available any time to chat now, this weekend, or next week
2016-02-12T22:06:48 <colinclark> alanharnum: I guess there\'s something specific I\'m trying to get at, but struggling to articulate
2016-02-12T22:06:56 <colinclark> Our work on Chart Authoring is just the beginning
2016-02-12T22:07:02 <colinclark> but what\'s it the beginning of?
2016-02-12T22:07:10 <colinclark> Why do people need alternatives to data visualizations?
2016-02-12T22:07:26 <colinclark> What could sonification provide to support and enhance the learning process?
2016-02-12T22:07:41 <colinclark> Why do we want to make it easy for anyone to create their own accessible charts?
2016-02-12T22:07:45 <alanharnum> something like "some learners can\'t see data visualizations at all; some may find them hard to understand. sonification of data may offer a path to helping some learners gain the advantages of summarization and exploration sonically, when they have been traditionally excluded from these benefits due to the visual medium"
2016-02-12T22:07:50 <colinclark> What are the different layers or modalities that support it
2016-02-12T22:08:11 <colinclark> I think that\'s a good starting point
2016-02-12T22:08:22 <colinclark> but there\'s a lot to unpack in "summarization and exploration"
2016-02-12T22:08:26 <colinclark> I know that it\'s only a 1-pager
2016-02-12T22:08:36 <colinclark> but I actually think it\'s answers to these question--and even raising them at all
2016-02-12T22:08:44 <simonjb> ok, thanks colinclark -- avtar and I are going to check in at 6 about the qi
2016-02-12T22:08:46 <colinclark> that are key to providing someone who is "outside our bubble" a view into what we\'re working on
2016-02-12T22:08:59 <colinclark> simonjb: ok, let me knwo if you want me to join
2016-02-12T22:09:06 <colinclark> more so than dates and history and the like, if that makes sense, alanharnum
2016-02-12T22:09:07 <simonjb> colinclark: will do
2016-02-12T22:09:20 <alanharnum> "charts and graphs are such a part of the learning process in certain subjects that it can be easy to forget that learning to read and interpret them is itself a learned skill, one that many learners may be cut off from, challenged or marginalized by"
2016-02-12T22:09:58 <alanharnum> "the chart authoring tool represents the early stages of our exploration of different modalities for the summarization and exploration of data"
2016-02-12T22:11:04 <alanharnum> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infographic#History
2016-02-12T22:11:37 <jhung> Sorry alanharnum I added another comment.
2016-02-12T22:11:55 <alanharnum> i think something i\'d emphasize in talking about this is that what we think of these days as slick, useful ways of understanding and comprehending data is around 400 years of intellectual development and continual iteration on the visual presentation of information and data
2016-02-12T22:12:14 <alanharnum> and that there\'s still a lot of things that can go wrong in visualizing information and data
2016-02-12T22:12:46 <alanharnum> see http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_pp etc :)
2016-02-12T22:13:16 <alanharnum> some of what we\'re doing here is building initial tooling to allow us to explore data sonification methodically
2016-02-12T22:14:03 <colinclark> yes, that\'s true
2016-02-12T22:15:25 <colinclark> but it\'s not just an experiment--we know (and need to state clearly) that a) learners learn differently and b) visualizations and charts and graphs aren\'t going to be accessible or usable for everyone and c) representing data in multiple modes simultaneously has a massive curbcut advantage
2016-02-12T22:15:34 <colinclark> I wouldn\'t overplay the "experimental" angle
2016-02-12T22:15:41 <alanharnum> yeah that\'s a point
2016-02-12T22:15:56 <alanharnum> the multimodal stuff is really important
2016-02-12T22:15:57 <colinclark> we do still have a very early prototype, though, yes
2016-02-12T22:16:08 <alanharnum> so maybe it\'s a bigger point about data and the transformation of data
2016-02-12T22:16:14 <colinclark> yup, that\'s part of it
2016-02-12T22:16:27 <colinclark> As someone from outside our bubble, we have to give them a sense of why sonification matters, how it can help
2016-02-12T22:16:40 <colinclark> and we need to convey the simonjb\'s FIRST PRINCIPLE
2016-02-12T22:16:43 <colinclark> and so on
2016-02-12T22:16:56 <colinclark> so when you\'re back from vacation, we can work at it a bit
2016-02-12T22:16:58 <alanharnum> which is that charts and graphs are a derived product, rather than a thing-in-themselves; they are a transformation
2016-02-12T22:17:08 <colinclark> this will also be good material for our ASSETS paper, then
2016-02-12T22:17:09 <alanharnum> diverse learners need other forms of transformation available
2016-02-12T22:17:28 <colinclark> yup
2016-02-12T22:17:40 <colinclark> I won\'t get Latourian on the "derived product" point :)
2016-02-12T22:17:43 <colinclark> but you\'re exactly right
2016-02-12T22:17:54 <simonjb> avtar, colinclark: I\'m heading home now, see you online again around 6
2016-02-12T22:18:02 <colinclark> see you then, simonjb
2016-02-12T22:18:03 <avtar> simonjb: sounds good
2016-02-12T22:18:42 <alanharnum> i think a core idea of our practice is that things must be allowed and incentivized and capable of becoming other things
2016-02-12T22:19:02 <alanharnum> both as a utilitarian argument (the support of diverse learning styles) and as a moral one
2016-02-12T22:19:18 <jhung> alanharnum: I\'m heading off soon, but I can handle the deployment of ILDH once your pull us ready to be merged.
2016-02-12T22:19:27 <colinclark> Interestingly, in your "How was the Work Done?" section, I see the question as being "flipped," alanharnum
2016-02-12T22:19:37 <colinclark> It\'s as much, to me, a question of how people can get involved
2016-02-12T22:19:39 <colinclark> how they can help
2016-02-12T22:20:07 <alanharnum> jhung: I just pushed a rewording - if that looks good to you I think it\'s ready
2016-02-12T22:20:11 <colinclark> Rather than our design methods being about us, they\'re actually about activating a new kind of participation
2016-02-12T22:20:26 <colinclark> So the question is "How Can I Help?" or something along those lines
2016-02-12T22:20:29 <jhung> ok let me take a look.
2016-02-12T22:20:34 <alanharnum> colinclark: yeah, i think that\'s a good point
2016-02-12T22:20:39 <colinclark> anyway, these are all just thoughts--I hope they\'re helpful
2016-02-12T22:20:41 <colinclark> and again, they can wait
2016-02-12T22:20:45 <alanharnum> yeah, totally
2016-02-12T22:21:09 <alanharnum> what i\'d see eventually might be a document that links outward to things like the inclusive design cards, or interleaves them, etc etc
2016-02-12T22:21:34 <colinclark> totally
2016-02-12T22:21:51 <alanharnum> sort of our version of (super corporate, but useful in thinking about this maybe) a product fact sheet
2016-02-12T22:22:42 <jhung> alanharnum: ok. I\'ll merge and get this deployed.
2016-02-12T22:22:52 <alanharnum> thanks jhung
2016-02-12T22:23:18 <alanharnum> colinclark: but transformed to emphasize the things that matter to us - process as much as final product, inviting the community to participate, etc
2016-02-12T22:25:40 <colinclark> yup, that\'s right, alanharnum
2016-02-12T22:28:01 * sepidehshahi has left the channel
2016-02-12T22:32:15 * jhung has quit
2016-02-12T22:32:50 <alanharnum> i will one day create an automated tool for translating hermeneutics into formalism ;)
2016-02-12T22:33:27 <alanharnum> but then i realize that very idea is formalist in concept, and become distressed
2016-02-12T22:33:31 <alanharnum> http://existentialcomics.com/comic/29
2016-02-12T22:34:38 <colinclark> I love that one :)
2016-02-12T22:35:24 <alanharnum> i love the whole thing
2016-02-12T22:35:56 <alanharnum> the Sisyphus one is probably as responsible as anything for me no longer playing World of Warcraft
2016-02-12T22:38:06 <alanharnum> ok i\'m heading out
2016-02-12T22:38:18 <alanharnum> thank you everyone for fast turnaround on reviews of my content :)
2016-02-12T23:01:53 * simonjb joined the channel
2016-02-12T23:08:50 <simonjb> avtar: how goes it?
2016-02-12T23:09:06 <avtar> hey simonjb
2016-02-12T23:09:26 <avtar> almost done here
2016-02-12T23:09:51 <simonjb> 15mins?
2016-02-12T23:10:15 <simonjb> avtar: or longer?
2016-02-12T23:10:33 <avtar> nah, just 15 mins
2016-02-12T23:10:42 <simonjb> cool, ping me

2016-02-12T23:44:05 <colinclark> I am
2016-02-12T23:44:10 <colinclark> Sitting here cursing JIRA
2016-02-12T23:44:22 <avtar> would you like to join us in my vidyo room instead?
2016-02-12T23:44:35 <colinclark> Do you have a quality infrastructure component somewhere in the GPII JIRA?
'

b'2016-02-12T18:46:38 <simonjb> thanks
2016-02-12T18:47:11 <michelled> cindyli: maybe do what you think is best and then check in with Dana on Tuesday
2016-02-12T18:47:23 <avtar> simonjb: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/WPA2_Enterprise#eduroam
2016-02-12T18:47:23 <cindyli> sure, michelled
2016-02-12T18:47:39 <avtar> i found it easier to use networkmanager though
2016-02-12T18:49:06 <cindyli> alanharnum: i wonder if you ever tried the chart authoring tool with IE? I hope it works the same way as firefox.
2016-02-12T18:49:26 <cindyli> i\'m upgrading my virtualbox on this machine, will try it once i can start my windows VM
2016-02-12T18:49:48 <alanharnum> cindyli: I have, but it was a ways back - i\'m uncertain how good even the latest IE/Edge support is in practice for Web Audio
2016-02-12T18:50:14 <cindyli> alanharnum: does flocking support IE?
2016-02-12T18:50:23 <cindyli> colinclark: ^
2016-02-12T18:50:40 <colinclark> cindyli: It supports Edge, yes
2016-02-12T18:50:46 <cindyli> cool
2016-02-12T18:50:56 <colinclark> Happily, IE is dead :)
2016-02-12T18:50:56 <alanharnum> http://caniuse.com/#feat=audio-api
2016-02-12T18:51:28 <colinclark> Interestingly, Edge\'s Web Audio implementation is Chrome\'s
2016-02-12T18:51:31 <cindyli> colinclark: IE11 is alive
2016-02-12T18:51:38 <colinclark> it\'s dead to me :)
2016-02-12T18:51:57 <cindyli> haha
2016-02-12T18:52:02 <colinclark> We haven\'t talked about it a lot, but I\'m hoping that after we release 2.0 we will drop IE altogether
2016-02-12T18:52:16 <colinclark> and move to an "only the latest modern browsers" support policy
2016-02-12T18:52:20 <colinclark> I can imagine that will be contentious
2016-02-12T18:52:35 <colinclark> since users of older versions of Windows don\'t have access to Edge
2016-02-12T18:52:43 <colinclark> as you point out, IE11 will be alive for a long time in practice
2016-02-12T18:54:45 <jhung> michelled: I\'ve updated the pull req. Fixed typo and removed the line about Chrome.
2016-02-12T18:57:56 <alanharnum> cindyli: I just tested it on Edge in a Windows machine in the lab, and the audio behaves same as FF
2016-02-12T18:58:10 <cindyli> YAY!! thanks, alanharnum
2016-02-12T18:58:13 <alanharnum> no voice labels, but sonification itself plays
2016-02-12T18:58:18 <cindyli> cool
2016-02-12T18:59:05 <jhung> thanks michelled for the comment.
2016-02-12T18:59:11 <michelled> :)
2016-02-12T19:00:52 <gtirloni> colinclark: it seems win10 users already have to go out of their way to use ie11.. i think they will never really uninstall it because of so many apps that linked directly to its DLLs (and the trident engine seems good at emulating ie6/7/8/9/10). so maybe it will be one of those items you have to specifically install in control panel (hopefully!)
2016-02-12T19:01:04 <gtirloni> colinclark: they had some sense of humor about the whole thing, i appreciate that :) -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD9FAOPBiDk
2016-02-12T19:02:53 <jhung> michelled: changes are live http://www.floeproject.org/
2016-02-12T19:03:00 <michelled> thanks!

2016-02-12T19:03:38 <colinclark> gtirloni: That video is great! :)
2016-02-12T19:20:31 <avtar> colinclark, simonjb: my room?
2016-02-12T19:20:36 <colinclark> sure
2016-02-12T19:20:43 <simonjb> sure
2016-02-12T19:21:50 <alanharnum> interesting article about building accessible breakout with web audio and SVG: http://www.sitepoint.com/creating-accessible-breakout-game-using-web-audio-svg/
2016-02-12T19:21:53 <alanharnum> from September of last year
2016-02-12T19:22:38 <alanharnum> called "Breakout4All"
2016-02-12T19:34:19 <cindyli> alanharnum: i sent a pull request to include a browser suppprt section into the overview panel description for the chart authoring demo. can you have a look - https://github.com/fluid-project/chartAuthoring/pull/13
2016-02-12T19:34:52 <alanharnum> sure cindyli
2016-02-12T19:35:01 <cindyli> thanks, alanharnum
2016-02-12T19:36:29 <alanharnum> made one small wording comment
2016-02-12T19:36:35 <cindyli> michelled: just to double check. we meant to update the chart authoring demo with the browser support info today, right? if there are concerns raised next Tuesday in the talk with Dana, I issue another pull request. do i understand it correctly?
2016-02-12T19:36:52 <cindyli> good catch, alanharnum
2016-02-12T19:36:56 <alanharnum> i\'m also not sure if it\'s worth mentioning that it will work in FF if you enable the text-to-speech features via about:config
2016-02-12T19:37:16 <alanharnum> that will work (I\'ve tested it, voice labels and sonification behave as expected), but it might be a bit complicated and confusing
2016-02-12T19:38:07 <cindyli> alanharnum: i tested that too. i\'m also not sure if we should teach users to config their browser in this section
2016-02-12T19:38:17 <alanharnum> i think the answer is "probably not" :)
2016-02-12T19:38:45 <cindyli> alanharnum: maybe i should adjust the wording such as not to mention chrome or safari
2016-02-12T19:39:54 <cindyli> if users happen to have the config turned on in firefox or they have the knowledge there\'s such a config to turned on in firefox, this description automatically applies.
2016-02-12T19:40:00 <cindyli> alanharnum: what do you think?
2016-02-12T19:40:11 <michelled> cindyli: yes
2016-02-12T19:40:22 <alanharnum> i think that could work well - maybe also a link to http://caniuse.com/#feat=speech-synthesis?
2016-02-12T19:41:01 <cindyli> ok. thanks, michelled, can you help to merge in the pull request once alanharnum has a pass on my wording
2016-02-12T19:41:38 <michelled> cindyli: I\'ll comment on the pull and get you to push it
2016-02-12T19:41:48 <cindyli> sure, michelled
2016-02-12T19:43:04 <cindyli> alanharnum: i tried the add a link for "text to speech api", the link shows with an unreadable purple font color. i\'m a bit worry about adjusting the colour at this last minute because that means fixing that colour for all high contrast themes
2016-02-12T19:43:13 <cindyli> **to** typo
2016-02-12T19:43:16 <alanharnum> ok, don\'t worry about it then
2016-02-12T19:43:20 <alanharnum> just leave it be
2016-02-12T19:44:21 <colinclark> alanharnum: I do think it\'s worth mentioning that it can work on Firefox
2016-02-12T19:44:28 <colinclark> you might just list it as a little note or footnote
2016-02-12T19:44:35 <colinclark> it\'s not a supported configuration, but here\'s how
2016-02-12T19:44:38 <colinclark> something along those lines
2016-02-12T19:44:48 <alanharnum> We mention it in some other contexts like https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/%28Floe%29+Sonification
2016-02-12T19:44:56 <alanharnum> cindyli is specifically rewording the demo\'s overview panel
2016-02-12T19:45:10 <colinclark> My motivation is only because i don\'t know how long Mozilla is going to keep this behind a flag
2016-02-12T19:45:23 <alanharnum> i hope for not too much longer :/
2016-02-12T19:45:40 <colinclark> This situation where some vendors ship an emerging web platform  by default and others hide it behind a flag is pretty terrible
2016-02-12T19:45:46 <colinclark> It actually makes me miss vendor prefixes
2016-02-12T19:45:54 <colinclark> in that they\'ve shifted their problem into our problem
2016-02-12T19:46:32 <colinclark> since there\'s no pragmatic criteria about when these things become available
2016-02-12T19:46:53 <alanharnum> colinclark: as long as I have you can I ask you to review https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Chart+Authoring+Introduction if you have a bit of time? I\'d like to do some updates to it before the end of today.
2016-02-12T19:47:37 <colinclark> one comment about the first sentence:
2016-02-12T19:48:05 <colinclark> I wonder if there\'s a way to convey that it\'s a prototype now, but it\'s in active development and will continue to evolve and have more features
2016-02-12T19:48:06 <cindyli> colinclark: if you have time, probably you can review my pull request for adding the browser support section on the overview panel for the chart authoring demo
2016-02-12T19:48:09 <cindyli> https://github.com/fluid-project/chartAuthoring/pull/13

2016-02-12T19:48:27 <colinclark> ok, sure cindyli
2016-02-12T19:48:56 <cindyli> thanks, colinclark, especially in terms of whether the actual browsers should be mentioned, since u brought it up ;)
2016-02-12T19:49:13 <alanharnum> colinclark: how\'s this: "The FLOE Chart Authoring Tool is an OER authoring tool that supports the creation of highly accessible charts, including experimental conversion of chart data into representation by sound (\xe2\x80\x9csonification\xe2\x80\x9d) as well as by visual display. Currently at the stage of a functional prototype, it is still in active development and will continue to evolve and add new features."

2016-02-12T21:21:11 <jhung> alanharnum: your changes look good. I don\'t have any further edits.
2016-02-12T21:21:43 <alanharnum> jhung: ok, great - if it sounds OK i\'ll merge it before end of day so it will be up on the production site before next week

2016-02-12T21:23:36 <cindyli> alanharnum: i added one line about the actual browsers into the pull request for chart authoring demo, overview panel, can you give a glance: https://github.com/fluid-project/chartAuthoring/pull/13
2016-02-12T21:27:41 <alanharnum> cindyli: added a comment - I think we need to make it clear only Firefox needs the configuration to be enabld
2016-02-12T21:29:00 <colinclark> I\'m swamped with various requests to read and review and help with stuff
2016-02-12T21:29:02 <colinclark> which is awesome
2016-02-12T21:29:06 <colinclark> because everyone is producing so much!
2016-02-12T21:29:15 <colinclark> cindyli: I haven\'t looked at PR #13, but I will try soon
2016-02-12T21:29:33 <colinclark> alanharnum: working backwards, I am just skimming your SVG accessibility ILDH page
2016-02-12T21:29:54 <colinclark> I wonder if there\'s a way that you can describe not just "what" SVG is
2016-02-12T21:29:59 <colinclark> by why
2016-02-12T21:30:11 * anvk has quit
2016-02-12T21:30:25 <colinclark> it seems to me that, for someone who might not be super technical, "vector graphics" won\'t communicate some really key points that you might want to lead in with
2016-02-12T21:30:56 <colinclark> which is that SVG provides a way of drawing, creating animations, etc. that is scalable--that can easily be resized for small and large screens
2016-02-12T21:31:01 <colinclark> the responsive web design angle
2016-02-12T21:31:13 <alanharnum> colinclark: I think I can push some information up from lower portions into the intro
2016-02-12T21:31:19 <colinclark> yes, exactly
2016-02-12T21:31:21 <colinclark> you get into it later
2016-02-12T21:31:32 <colinclark> but a really brief summary that describes the value up front I think is key
2016-02-12T21:32:04 <colinclark> just a sentence :)
2016-02-12T21:34:41 <alanharnum> how\'s this: "SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is a means of describing vector graphics using XML. Functionally, this is both a way of drawing images in web browsers using pure markup language and a way of using vector graphics directly in the browser using web standards technology. Vector graphics can have significant advantages in certain scenarios due to being easily resizable (up or down) without loss of resolution, w
2016-02-12T21:34:41 <alanharnum> ith implications for scenarios like responsive web design and animation."
2016-02-12T21:43:25 <colinclark> still leads a little technically :)
2016-02-12T21:43:34 <colinclark> is there a way you can flip the order?
2016-02-12T21:43:41 <colinclark> the why, then the what
2016-02-12T21:43:56 <colinclark> so the "easily resizable" before the XML and "pure markup?"
2016-02-12T21:46:15 <colinclark> cindyli: I like your overview panel text
2016-02-12T21:46:16 <colinclark> thank you
2016-02-12T21:46:41 <alanharnum> lemme juggle
2016-02-12T21:46:44 <cindyli> yay! thanks, colinclark
2016-02-12T21:46:45 <alanharnum> i probably shouldn\'t even mention XML at all
2016-02-12T21:46:58 <alanharnum> since it will just scare anyone who\'s ever had to deal with XML
2016-02-12T21:47:03 <alanharnum> (justifiably so)
2016-02-12T21:47:07 <colinclark> :)
2016-02-12T21:47:13 <colinclark> as well as those who haven\'t
2016-02-12T21:47:15 <colinclark> you do mention it later
2016-02-12T21:47:17 <colinclark> so I think you\'re right
2016-02-12T21:47:18 <cindyli> colinclark: can you left a comment on my pull request about go ahead to merge? i will merge
2016-02-12T21:48:26 <colinclark> cindyli: https://github.com/fluid-project/chartAuthoring/pull/13#issuecomment-183500665
2016-02-12T21:48:41 <cindyli> super. thanks, colinclark
2016-02-12T21:48:50 <cindyli> SHIP IT!!
2016-02-12T21:50:08 <colinclark> :) :)
2016-02-12T21:50:31 <alanharnum> colinclark: "SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is a means of describing vector graphics in markup on a web page. Vector graphics can be advantageous in many scenarios due to being easily resizable without loss of resolution and being scriptable using Javascript in complex ways. Both these characteristics have implications for scenarios such as responsive web design and animation."
2016-02-12T21:50:38 <alanharnum> less wordy, XML--
2016-02-12T21:50:42 <michelled> fluid-everyone: I need to go offline now but I\'ll be working tomorrow. please let me know if there\'s anything you need me to do prior to the P4A face to face and the Hewlett meetings. simonjb: I\'m well aware of the presentations that are nearly ready for you :)
2016-02-12T21:51:02 <simonjb> thanks michelled
2016-02-12T21:51:18 <alanharnum> michelled: thanks - I\'ll send you a roundup email at end of day with links to all the Chart Authoring product that\'s live
2016-02-12T21:52:08 <michelled> great, thx alanharnum. I\'ve already sent some of the links to Jutta, but if there are more things, I\'ll be sure to send them along too
2016-02-12T21:52:24 <alanharnum> ty cindyli / jhung / colinclark for feedback on ILDH entry - first i\'ve done, kind of exciting
2016-02-12T21:53:19 <colinclark> alanharnum: Maybe for your second sentence you could say something along the lines of "Vector graphics can be advantageous for inclusive design because they can be easily resized, scaled to different resolutions without loss of quality, and tagged with additional semantics that make them compatible with assistive technologies such as screen readers"?
2016-02-12T21:55:41 <alanharnum> colinclark: "SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is a means of describing vector graphics in markup on a web page.

2016-02-12T15:03:16 <colinclark> it will start to fail to trigger notes

2016-02-12T18:24:17 <jhung> michelled - I sent you a pull request for updating Floeproject.org. Want to take a quick look and see that it has all we need?
2016-02-12T18:25:00 <jhung> ^ https://github.com/fluid-project/floeproject.org/pull/40
2016-02-12T18:25:11 <michelled> thx jhung!
2016-02-12T18:32:06 <michelled> jhung: I wonder if we need to mention using Chrome - it feels a bit out of place on this page
2016-02-12T18:32:09 <michelled> what do you think?
2016-02-12T18:32:37 <jhung> michelled: I\'m afraid without that someone using FF will try it and not have it work.
2016-02-12T18:33:34 <michelled> jhung: I wonder if the demo should actually mention that
2016-02-12T18:34:23 <jhung> michelled: I think it should probably in both places.
2016-02-12T18:35:07 <michelled> jhung: there is a typo in the design guidelines sentence \'prinples\'
2016-02-12T18:35:25 <jhung> michelled: thanks I\'ll fix that.
2016-02-12T18:35:50 <michelled> jhung: the first discovery tool only works in chrome but we don\'t mention that on this page
2016-02-12T18:36:02 * alanharnum joined the channel
2016-02-12T18:36:03 <michelled> I think this page was intended to read more simply
2016-02-12T18:36:41 <michelled> alanharnum, cindyli: I think the chart authoring demo should mention which browsers the sonification works in
2016-02-12T18:36:57 <cindyli> good idea, michelled
2016-02-12T18:36:59 <alanharnum> michelled: the overlay panel you mean?
2016-02-12T18:37:34 <michelled> I\'m not sure. first discovery, for example, only works in chrome so we just put up a message if you open it in FF
2016-02-12T18:37:39 <michelled> that\'s certainly not ideal
2016-02-12T18:38:34 <jhung> michelled: I like simplicity too, but I think it\'s a bit disappointing to follow a link to only find it doesn\'t work. It\'s like getting a link and finding out it requires Flash. :D
2016-02-12T18:38:50 <jhung> ^ especially if it\'s a cat video.
2016-02-12T18:38:51 * Jess_ joined the channel
2016-02-12T18:38:56 <jhung> and it was epic.
2016-02-12T18:38:59 <alanharnum> michelled: i believe the only thing that won\'t work in all modern browsers are the voice labels
2016-02-12T18:39:07 <alanharnum> so we could insert some language about that
2016-02-12T18:39:10 <michelled> jhung: are you suggesting we change the text for first discovery too?
2016-02-12T18:39:56 <michelled> alanharnum: do you have thoughts on how the floeproject site should read?
2016-02-12T18:39:59 <jhung> michelled: yeah. Maybe we can put a footnote instead for the relevent section?
2016-02-12T18:40:21 <alanharnum> michelled: I think I missed the original link to this discussion
2016-02-12T18:40:24 <michelled> alanharnum: maybe you could take a look at jhung\'s pull request? https://github.com/fluid-project/floeproject.org/pull/40/files
2016-02-12T18:40:27 <alanharnum> sure
2016-02-12T18:40:32 * simonjb joined the channel
2016-02-12T18:41:01 <alanharnum> I think it would be fine to remove the comment about Chrome and put something into the demo itself
2016-02-12T18:41:01 <michelled> alanharnum: I was noting how jhung has specifically menioned which browser to use for chart authoring, but we don\'t do that for first discovery
2016-02-12T18:41:10 <alanharnum> the demo doesn\'t become nonfunctional without the Web Speech API
2016-02-12T18:41:17 <alanharnum> you just won\'t hear the voice labels
2016-02-12T18:41:34 <simonjb> avtar: can you remind me of the wifi network that we discussed yesterday that I could use in Germany?
2016-02-12T18:42:02 <simonjb> I\'d like to set it up before our run through to test working on an external network
2016-02-12T18:42:17 <jhung> alanharnum: so what do you think - should we remove that Web Speech API requirement from the Floeproject pull req.?
2016-02-12T18:42:51 <michelled> cindyli: can you take that change on, please?
2016-02-12T18:43:04 <avtar> simonjb: sure, it might be best to do it over vidyo though so that we can use screen sharing
2016-02-12T18:43:15 <michelled> cindyli: the one to the demo
2016-02-12T18:43:18 <cindyli> sure. michelled. let me catch up the conversation on where needs to be changed
2016-02-12T18:43:29 <cindyli> michelled: u mean the overview panel?
2016-02-12T18:43:59 <michelled> cindyli, alanharnum: I don\'t know if it should be on the overview panel or the demo itself. do you have opinions?
2016-02-12T18:44:11 <cindyli> michelled: i think the overview panel
2016-02-12T18:44:24 <simonjb> avtar: could we do that now?
2016-02-12T18:45:10 <avtar> i just need to grab a bite before we start our call
2016-02-12T18:45:20 <avtar> if we could do it as part of that call or right after that would be better
2016-02-12T18:45:55 <simonjb> avtar: ok, sounds good -- what\'s the name?
2016-02-12T18:46:11 <simonjb> then at least I can do a little research between now and 2
2016-02-12T18:46:13 <alanharnum> michelled cindyli: I think it would be OK in the overview panel, or in a message above "Enter Chart Title". Don\'t have a strong opinion.
2016-02-12T18:46:34 <avtar> simonjb: eduroam
