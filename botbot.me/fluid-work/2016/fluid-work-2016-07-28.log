b'2016-07-28T22:45:51 <colinclark> but should be more than enough to now be able to hack on stuff
2016-07-28T22:46:01 <colinclark> I don\'t exactly know how tests will work for an Electron application, either
2016-07-28T22:46:45 <colinclark> I can even log in with different users
2016-07-28T22:46:50 <michelled> :)
2016-07-28T22:46:56 <colinclark> as will be no surprise to sgithens, of course
2016-07-28T22:47:27 <colinclark> There are still so many issues causing my head to spin
2016-07-28T22:47:44 <colinclark> such as "will we eventually move to a situation where we always run the GPII inside Electron?"
2016-07-28T22:47:48 <colinclark> and I think the answer is probably yes
2016-07-28T22:48:08 <colinclark> and "how can we manage builds between plain Node.js (for unit/acceptance testing) and Electron?"
2016-07-28T22:48:44 <colinclark> not to mention "how do we unit test stuff in the task tray?"
2016-07-28T22:49:13 <colinclark> and when will we upgrade to newer node.js versions, and how awful will it actually be?
2016-07-28T22:49:31 <colinclark> Electron has changed massively between 0.34 and 1.x
2016-07-28T22:54:30 <colinclark> It doesn\'t really look to me like electron-rebuild is particularly useful
2016-07-28T22:54:49 <colinclark> I\'m not sure why it\'s much more advantageous than, say, a script that sets some npm_config environment variables

2016-07-28T18:28:31 <jhung> TPark, godfrey_: I\'m doing some research for Energy Skate Park and came across this podcast about a game called "Blind Swordsman". Skip to the 7 minute, 56 second mark to hear an example of the gameplay. http://www.applevis.com/sites/default/files/podcasts/AppleVisPodcast741.mp3
2016-07-28T18:28:53 <TPark> jhung: thanks, will take a look
2016-07-28T18:30:00 <jhung> it\'s really cool. The player controls the direction the swordsman faces. You can tell where your enemies are by the stereo sound. You perform parries and attacks based on the audio cues.
2016-07-28T18:31:55 <godfrey_> thanks jhung super cool!
2016-07-28T18:32:38 <TPark> jhung: agreed, this is really cool!

2016-07-28T20:31:17 <avtar> colinclark: hi
2016-07-28T20:32:10 <colinclark> i noticed that the VM for the universal repo works differently than the others
2016-07-28T20:32:40 <colinclark> i noticed this by accidentally deleting my universal directory :)
2016-07-28T20:33:04 <avtar> colinclark: differently in what way?
2016-07-28T20:33:18 <colinclark> I guess it\'s probably entirely idiomatic, up until the point where I merged the changes where universal is sourced via npm instead of that crazy grunt-gpii scheme
2016-07-28T20:33:26 <colinclark> well, it looks like there\'s an extra wrapper directory
2016-07-28T20:33:28 <colinclark> so it\'s
2016-07-28T20:33:37 <colinclark> ~/sync/node_modules/universal
2016-07-28T20:33:55 <colinclark> where the tail of that path is the shared directory
2016-07-28T20:34:10 <colinclark> on linux, ~/sync directly contains the shared directory
2016-07-28T20:34:46 <avtar> colinclark: yes, i see it now
2016-07-28T20:34:46 <avtar> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/provisioning/vagrant-vars.yml#L9
2016-07-28T20:35:17 <colinclark> so I could make a pull request that changed this path to /home/vagrant/sync
2016-07-28T20:35:20 <colinclark> is that correct?
2016-07-28T20:35:47 <avtar> yes
2016-07-28T20:36:02 <colinclark> just like this, I guess: https://github.com/GPII/linux/blob/master/provisioning/vars.yml#L48

2016-07-28T22:03:05 <colinclark> OK
2016-07-28T22:03:11 <colinclark> I KNOW SOME THINGS
2016-07-28T22:03:46 <colinclark> I think there is some combination of
2016-07-28T22:03:53 <colinclark> a) electron-rebuild might suck
2016-07-28T22:04:03 <colinclark> and b) I don\'t fully know what electron-rebuild is doing
2016-07-28T22:04:41 <colinclark> HOWEVER
2016-07-28T22:04:54 <colinclark> I do have sgithens\' task tray running inside an avtar-provisioned vagrant box
2016-07-28T22:05:03 <colinclark> with a few caveats that he is suggesting workarounds for
2016-07-28T22:05:22 <colinclark> This is using the ancient version of Electron, v0.34.5, which is still based on Node 4.x
2016-07-28T22:05:44 <colinclark> I am not yet optimistic that we can upgrade to Electron 1.x because I haven\'t seen any evidence that anything other than vanilla universal will run on Node 6.x
2016-07-28T22:06:27 <colinclark> but I do at least see a tiny, aliased GPII logo in my task tray
2016-07-28T22:06:46 <colinclark> The first caveat is that something in our toolchain, probably gyp, hates UNC paths
2016-07-28T22:07:00 <colinclark> which are, as Bosmon explained earlier "the funny ones that start with two backslashes"
2016-07-28T22:07:26 <colinclark> and which avtar described as what "they refer to as a path"
2016-07-28T22:07:40 * simonjb has quit
2016-07-28T22:07:43 <colinclark> They appear in our world because of the fact that our code is shared using VBox shared folders
2016-07-28T22:07:46 <colinclark> or whatever they\'re called
2016-07-28T22:07:58 <colinclark> and will cause electron-rebuild to barf
2016-07-28T22:08:06 <avtar> i may or may not have said some things
2016-07-28T22:08:12 <colinclark> hahaha
2016-07-28T22:08:16 <colinclark> secondly, electron-rebuild seems to, for whatever reason, not recognize our version of the msbuild tools
2016-07-28T22:08:19 <colinclark> also causing it to barf
2016-07-28T22:08:40 <colinclark> however, I was able to use an .npmrc file to build everything against electron
2016-07-28T22:09:12 <colinclark> i\'ll share it once i figure out where a working web browser lives in my vbox
2016-07-28T22:10:16 <Bosmon> What is a .npmrc file .....
2016-07-28T22:10:29 <colinclark> it is a file that sets npm config variables
2016-07-28T22:10:35 <Bosmon> colinclark - did you manage to see again your issue with "module" being undefined during Infusion\'s self-deduping?
2016-07-28T22:10:39 <colinclark> of the sort that you could also set with environment variables
2016-07-28T22:10:39 <colinclark> or npm flags
2016-07-28T22:10:59 <Bosmon> And... what *does* electron-rebuild do?
2016-07-28T22:11:00 <colinclark> Bosmon: no, and I think it was probably spurious
2016-07-28T22:11:05 <colinclark> Bosmon: see b)
2016-07-28T22:11:07 <colinclark> I have no clue
2016-07-28T22:11:36 <colinclark> other than to say that it is supposed to take an collection of npm-installed modules and rebuild them against electron\'s version of Node
2016-07-28T22:11:42 <Bosmon> Ah ok
2016-07-28T22:11:49 <colinclark> and that it was tooling that sgithens was able to successfully use at some point
2016-07-28T22:11:51 <Bosmon> That\'s pretty bizarre
2016-07-28T22:12:03 <colinclark> https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/v1.3.1/docs/tutorial/using-native-node-modules.md
2016-07-28T22:12:04 <Bosmon> It requires some action of "npm install" to have happened already?
2016-07-28T22:12:07 <colinclark> https://github.com/electron/electron-rebuild
2016-07-28T22:12:08 <Bosmon> It doesn\'t do this from scratch?
2016-07-28T22:12:33 <colinclark> I believe it expects to have the modules npm installed already
2016-07-28T22:12:40 <colinclark> but i can\'t even confirm that
2016-07-28T22:13:28 <colinclark> avtar: Ok, your trick worked
2016-07-28T22:13:42 * kasparnet joined the channel
2016-07-28T22:13:43 <colinclark> If I map the shared folder to E:\\, I get to the next phase of errors
2016-07-28T22:14:16 <colinclark> net use e: \\\\vboxsvr\\vagrant
2016-07-28T22:14:30 <colinclark> and now I have a handy place to store my .gpii-token files any time I want to
2016-07-28T22:17:25 <colinclark> oh, the other thing I should say is that I have switched this box to use 64-bit node.js
2016-07-28T22:17:39 <colinclark> for no precise reason
2016-07-28T22:18:10 <colinclark> I was just trying to simplify things
2016-07-28T22:18:30 <colinclark> these are what my npm config settings looked like: http://pastie.org/10922320
2016-07-28T22:23:53 <colinclark> ok, michelled, your branch works too
2016-07-28T22:24:19 <colinclark> it logs a message to the effect of "Going to update the menu undefined"
2016-07-28T22:26:00 * kasparnet has quit
2016-07-28T22:33:36 <michelled> oh yay!
2016-07-28T22:34:08 <michelled> thx for figuring this out colinclark
2016-07-28T22:34:17 <colinclark> not sure what I figured out yet
2016-07-28T22:35:02 <colinclark> but I\'m now, for fun, going back to our default vagrant setup
2016-07-28T22:35:05 <colinclark> with the 32-bit node
2016-07-28T22:35:24 <colinclark> my guess is the issue is just that we\'ve got a 64-bit version of electron
2016-07-28T22:35:42 <colinclark> and the DLLs you compiled aren\'t compatible with it because they were compiled for 32-bit
2016-07-28T22:35:46 <colinclark> but who knows?
2016-07-28T22:44:01 <colinclark> So michelled I can now at least reproduce this all
2016-07-28T22:44:37 <colinclark> If you use that .npmrc file I pasted (or, presumably, specify all those as flags to npm), you should be able to run your code in our standard vagrant setup
2016-07-28T22:44:50 <colinclark> Basically this:
2016-07-28T22:44:52 <colinclark> 1. vagrant up
2016-07-28T22:44:57 <colinclark> 2. delete node_modules
2016-07-28T22:45:02 <colinclark> 3. npm install
2016-07-28T22:45:20 <colinclark> and then you should have a version of all your binaries that will work with Electron
2016-07-28T22:45:40 <colinclark> I don\'t imagine that the GPII itself is fully functional, but that\'s exactly what bens is working on--our issues of bit arity

2016-07-28T13:25:51 <the-t-in-rtf> @avtar @gtirloni, thanks to Gio's help with my Vagrant setup, I am ready to start QI builds for gpii-webdriver.

2016-07-28T13:26:04 <the-t-in-rtf> I can't assign the PR, I assume one of you will pick it up.

2016-07-28T14:02:52 * clown can't type
2016-07-28T14:03:36 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyone else coming?
2016-07-28T14:03:42 <the-t-in-rtf> We'll give it a minute and then start the demo.

2016-07-28T14:24:18 <Bosmon> Hey there stegru - is 3pm tomorrow ok for you for the Windows summit?
2016-07-28T14:25:38 <stegru> hi yes, that's fine
2016-07-28T14:26:39 <colinclark> Bosmon, stegru: Is it cool if I join the Windows summit, too?
2016-07-28T14:27:12 <stegru> hmm, I'm not sure about that
2016-07-28T14:27:36 <colinclark> hahaha
2016-07-28T14:28:13 <colinclark> hey avtar, how come the CI bot is going kind of wild this morning?
2016-07-28T14:29:04 <Bosmon> hahaha
2016-07-28T14:30:01 <Bosmon> I'm thinking we might just want to make this a regular fixture in fact
2016-07-28T14:30:11 * yzen joined the channel
2016-07-28T14:30:22 <Bosmon> But in the long term we'll want a meeting slot that sgithens can make as well
2016-07-28T14:30:27 <colinclark> yes, that's a good point
2016-07-28T14:33:37 <avtar> colinclark: one sec, taking a look

2016-07-28T15:08:10 <avtar> colinclark: sorry, i was on a call with the-t-in-rtf that just ended
2016-07-28T15:08:12 <avtar> now i'm _actually_ taking a look
2016-07-28T15:08:28 <colinclark> no worries :)
2016-07-28T15:08:36 <colinclark> it seems to have chilled out a bit
2016-07-28T15:12:11 <the-t-in-rtf> Hi, @colinclark.  I'm around for another 15-20 minutes if you need anything.
2016-07-28T15:12:19 <colinclark> just a quick question
2016-07-28T15:12:29 <the-t-in-rtf> go for it.
2016-07-28T15:12:31 <colinclark> I noticed you mentioned testing with Edge in one of your posts
2016-07-28T15:12:38 <colinclark> did you ever manage to find a way to get Testem to launch Edge?
2016-07-28T15:13:54 <avtar> colinclark: yeah, looks like it was mainly excited about two PRs
2016-07-28T15:14:08 <the-t-in-rtf> I didn't get it working if I tried.  I think I got as far as reading docs and giving up.
2016-07-28T15:15:15 <colinclark> the-t-in-rtf: Me too :(
2016-07-28T15:15:26 <colinclark> and a bunch of googling

2016-07-28T15:56:54 <stegru> yes I can now make changes, thanks gloob
2016-07-28T15:57:38 <gloob> stegru: anytime

2016-07-28T16:03:12 <clown> happy birthday gtirloni !
2016-07-28T16:03:39 * clown heard marilyn monroe (aka alanharnum) singing
2016-07-28T16:04:03 <colinclark> michelled: Several of our dependencies seem to have Electron-specific forks
2016-07-28T16:04:09 <colinclark> which doesn't necessarily mean much
2016-07-28T16:04:21 <colinclark> I believe osc.js has an electron-specific fork despite probably not needing it anymore, for example
2016-07-28T16:04:25 <colinclark> but it is interesting
2016-07-28T16:04:39 * clown has quit
2016-07-28T16:06:22 <michelled> oh wow, yes that is interesting
2016-07-28T16:07:51 * wannabeCitizen has quit
2016-07-28T16:09:25 <colinclark> if nothing else, it's clear that we're pinned to some versions that are not Node 6.x compatible
2016-07-28T16:09:47 <colinclark> so I'll do some experimenting
