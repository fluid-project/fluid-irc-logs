2016-09-06T14:31:45 <Bosmon7> Perhaps after 7ish?
2016-09-06T14:34:50 <kasparnet> my time or your time?
2016-09-06T14:35:00 <kasparnet> Bosmon7: O
2016-09-06T14:35:02 <kasparnet> oops
2016-09-06T14:35:36 <kasparnet> We have a "housemeeting" at 19 my time - but I think it\'ll be short today, so I\'ll try and catch you sometime after that
2016-09-06T14:35:44 <Bosmon7> ok, that will be good

2016-09-06T15:03:52 <Justin_o> fluid-work: We\'re progressing through the open JIRAs for the Infusion 2.0. On the near horizon is https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5825 That will involve updating to the latest jQuery. I\'m not sure how many changes that will involve for our codebase, but would like to have all of the required PRs in before we take it on. If you are reviewing or
2016-09-06T15:03:52 <Justin_o> working on any code that is in a PR, please look at it as soon as possible. Thanks.

2016-09-06T16:26:02 <avtar> hey Justin_o
2016-09-06T16:27:02 <avtar> i can have both of my infusion related PRs addressed by tomorrow but i\'ll need to check in with michelled since the priority seems to be p4a work
2016-09-06T16:28:59 <Justin_o> avtar: do you know if they are required for Infusion 2.0?

2016-09-06T16:29:09 * yzen is now known as yzen_
2016-09-06T16:30:49 <avtar> i guess it depends on how strongly people want the infusion ci job to include browser tests before 2.0
2016-09-06T16:31:20 <Justin_o> avtar: okay, lets assume that there is a strong preference for that
2016-09-06T16:32:11 <avtar> with that assumption i guess they are required for 2.0 :)

2016-09-06T17:10:57 <Bosmon7> Cheers, avtar - someone with more bandwidth and more modern hardware than me will need to test this :)
