b'2016-02-02T20:05:57 <colinclark> so I\'m tempted towards the latter
2016-02-02T20:08:44 <Justin_o> colinclark, avtar: it might be helpful for tracking things later
2016-02-02T20:09:29 <avtar> sounds good
2016-02-02T20:09:31 <avtar> i\'ll create one
2016-02-02T20:11:23 <jhung> justin - thanks for the comment on the pull req. I\'ll take a look.

2016-02-02T20:30:56 <avtar> colinclark: ^
2016-02-02T20:31:15 <colinclark> is there any value in making it easy to run testem tests on "all available platforms"
2016-02-02T20:31:27 <colinclark> which I guess translates as 1) on your host and then 2) on the vagrant box
2016-02-02T20:31:49 <colinclark> I guess in the future there will be multiple vagrant boxes?
2016-02-02T20:31:55 <colinclark> one for windows, one for linux?
2016-02-02T20:32:02 <colinclark> will os x even ever be possible?
2016-02-02T20:32:05 * michelled joined the channel
2016-02-02T20:32:15 <avtar> colinclark: yes, we\'ll need to have separate ones for each operating system
2016-02-02T20:32:26 <gloob> you can run osx on virtualbox these days
2016-02-02T20:32:34 <gloob> I don\'t know if need to be hosted in a osx box
2016-02-02T20:32:41 <gloob> but I have one running in osx
2016-02-02T20:32:46 <avtar> gloob: does virtualbox offer guest additions for os x now?
2016-02-02T20:33:20 <avtar> i checked a few months ago and it seemed the recommended virtualization route for os x was just vmware fusion or workstation
2016-02-02T20:33:34 <gloob> yes
2016-02-02T20:33:39 <jhernandez> I got it working on my linux box
2016-02-02T20:33:40 <gloob> I mean, recommended is vmware
2016-02-02T20:33:44 <colinclark> avtar: Did you hear that VMWare laid off essentially the whole Workstation and Fusion teams?
2016-02-02T20:33:45 <avtar> ah ok
2016-02-02T20:33:47 <gloob> guest additions, no AFAIK
2016-02-02T20:33:49 <jhernandez> with virtual box
2016-02-02T20:33:52 <avtar> colinclark: yes :|
2016-02-02T20:34:07 <colinclark> I think virtualization on desktop platforms is going to really suck going forward
2016-02-02T20:34:08 <gloob> the difference is that vmware fusion allows some special osx debugging
2016-02-02T20:34:19 <gloob> directly with the kernel
2016-02-02T20:34:21 <colinclark> it\'s not like oracle is going to make Vbox awesome
2016-02-02T20:34:28 <gloob> I don\'t remember the technology nane now
2016-02-02T20:34:32 <gloob> s/nane/nmae
2016-02-02T20:34:35 <gloob> ok, jet lag
2016-02-02T20:34:58 <avtar> gloob: i didn\'t look into that aspect of it
2016-02-02T20:35:25 <colinclark> it is like 10:30 pm for you right now, gloob?
2016-02-02T20:35:30 <avtar> i just remember reading that one can expect better performance with vmware for os x guests due to guest additions being an option
2016-02-02T20:35:42 <avtar> which is too bad given the cost associated with vmware and the vagrant plugin

2016-02-02T20:36:37 <gloob> that is a very complete article
2016-02-02T20:36:40 <gtirloni> gloob: welcome!
2016-02-02T20:37:03 <gloob> gtirloni: thanks! (bow)
2016-02-02T20:37:22 <avtar> gloob: that is one quality blog post :)
2016-02-02T20:37:24 <avtar> bookmarked
2016-02-02T20:39:20 <amatas> avtar, just tested your ci branch
2016-02-02T20:39:28 <amatas> it seems everything goes fine
2016-02-02T20:40:43 <amatas> I\'ve used a windows VM I created using packer-io, so the vagrant provisioners works from the begining
2016-02-02T20:41:41 <avtar> amatas: do you know of a way to have path changes take effect globally in windows without having to restart?
2016-02-02T20:41:56 <avtar> and not just for one shell session

2016-02-02T20:43:12 <gtirloni> avtar: setx.exe should work
2016-02-02T20:48:15 <amatas> following the gtirloni clue: https://serverfault.com/questions/88363/how-do-i-set-the-global-path-environment-in-a-batch-file
2016-02-02T20:48:24 <amatas> avtar, have you tried that?
2016-02-02T20:49:03 <avtar> yes i have
2016-02-02T20:49:40 <avtar> i learned that setx seems to have a 1024 character limit
2016-02-02T20:51:11 <avtar> i\'ve used it in one of the scripts in my ci branch to append the path for npm packages but that character limit caveat doesn\'t sound appealing
2016-02-02T20:51:34 <avtar> http://superuser.com/questions/387619/overcoming-the-1024-character-limit-with-setx
2016-02-02T20:51:35 <amatas> what a ...
2016-02-02T20:52:11 <amatas> so it\'s seems to be a limit of the OS
2016-02-02T20:53:05 <avtar> ah interesting http://superuser.com/questions/387619/overcoming-the-1024-character-limit-with-setx#comment466979_387625

2016-02-02T17:55:20 <kasparnet> Bosmon: does any of this sound wrong to you:
2016-02-02T17:55:31 <kasparnet> 1) fresh clone of windows repo
2016-02-02T17:55:48 <kasparnet> 2) switch to your windows/GPII-1318 branch
2016-02-02T17:55:59 <kasparnet> 3) npm install --ignore-scripts
2016-02-02T17:56:02 <Bosmon> NO NO NO
2016-02-02T17:56:06 <Bosmon> NO --ignore-scripts
2016-02-02T17:56:22 <kasparnet> ok

2016-02-02T18:00:38 <kasparnet> when running npm install from windows folder
2016-02-02T18:01:22 <Bosmon> kasparnet - sure
2016-02-02T18:01:25 <Bosmon> Did you install it?
2016-02-02T18:01:37 <kasparnet> nope
2016-02-02T18:01:41 <kasparnet> :)
2016-02-02T18:01:44 <Bosmon> Well, then :)
2016-02-02T18:02:13 <kasparnet> Bosmon: do we have updated instructions anywhere for windows install related to GPII-1318, or should I create a JIRA for it?
2016-02-02T18:02:49 <Bosmon> kasparnet - the instructions are the same as the ones here: https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp
2016-02-02T18:02:56 <Bosmon> In the section labelled "on Windows"
2016-02-02T18:04:04 <kasparnet> Bosmon: thanks
2016-02-02T18:04:15 <kasparnet> so I\'d need Microsoft Visual Studio C++ 2013 as well
2016-02-02T18:04:19 <kasparnet> (running windows 8)
2016-02-02T18:04:22 <Bosmon> kasparnet - yes
2016-02-02T18:04:26 <kasparnet> gotcha
2016-02-02T18:04:26 <jhernandez> Steve commented on the windows portion of GPII-1318 (https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/67#issuecomment-172348345)
2016-02-02T18:04:45 <jhernandez> and explicitely asked for new instructions for building gpii/windows
2016-02-02T18:06:36 <kasparnet> Bosmon, jhernandez, sgithens, colinclark: I know we briefly talked about this previously, but would it make sense to version the install instructions for windows as part of the repo?
2016-02-02T18:06:45 <kasparnet> as sgithens suggested?
2016-02-02T18:07:06 <colinclark> yes
2016-02-02T18:07:08 <kasparnet> if so, I\'ll write down the instructions as I test this and make a pull against amb26/GPII-1318
2016-02-02T18:07:10 <colinclark> most definitely it makes sense
2016-02-02T18:07:23 <jhernandez> kasparnet: yes
2016-02-02T18:07:35 <colinclark> in general we seem to have moved towards a model where documentation is more closely aligned with the artifact it is documenting
2016-02-02T18:09:47 <jhernandez> ideally, I would love to simplify https://wiki.gpii.net/w/Setting_Up_Your_Development_Environment as much as possible
2016-02-02T18:11:23 <kasparnet> jhernandez: yeah, definitely
2016-02-02T18:12:04 <kasparnet> ideally, I\'d love to have that page not exist - or rather, just be a bunch of links to documentation in repositories + perhaps some troubleshooting documentation on the wiki
2016-02-02T18:12:14 <jhernandez> kasparnet: yup

2016-02-02T18:15:00 <amatas> jhernandez, kasparnet what do you think about to have a PS script to install gpii as chocolatey uses https://chocolatey.org/ , I think it could be easy to implement.
2016-02-02T18:16:43 <kasparnet> amatas: that\'d be really cool
2016-02-02T18:16:55 <kasparnet> anything to simplify the process would be really helpful
2016-02-02T18:17:25 <jhernandez> amatas: that\'d be great
2016-02-02T18:18:36 <jhernandez> in fact, I\'d say that we should consider having our own apcp chocolately repo with the gpii + other 3rd party apps that we\'re going to support, such as NVDA
2016-02-02T18:20:28 * jhung1 is now known as jhung
2016-02-02T18:20:35 <amatas> we could have to scripts at the repository one for users to test and other to develop. Then use the same "iex" command to pull the script and exec.

2016-02-02T19:56:12 <colinclark> alanharnum: Could you conceivably refactor your startSonification() function?
2016-02-02T19:56:23 <colinclark> it seems like it could be expressed as a set of event listeners instead
2016-02-02T19:56:40 <alanharnum> colinclark: yeah I think that would be very fast
2016-02-02T19:56:47 <colinclark> perhaps an onStart event
2016-02-02T19:56:57 <colinclark> and then you should be able to take each of those steps and just write them declaratively
2016-02-02T19:57:22 <alanharnum> it\'s been factored so much already that it\'s close to just being a set of event firers and change appliers anyway
2016-02-02T19:57:24 <colinclark> I wonder if you can also proactively instantiate your environment and synth?
2016-02-02T19:57:37 <colinclark> rather than doing it conditionally if they haven\'t already been created?
2016-02-02T19:57:50 <alanharnum> yeah we could just instatiate them on load
2016-02-02T19:57:59 <alanharnum> the conditional was to work around the issue we had, which we don\'t any more
2016-02-02T19:58:02 <colinclark> right
2016-02-02T19:58:06 <colinclark> this\'ll make it much simpler
2016-02-02T20:00:06 <colinclark> Bosmon: I didn\'t notice if you ever responded to my last comment about that "additive expander"
2016-02-02T20:00:38 <colinclark> my suggestion was that perhaps the expander would be much clearer and more useful it produced a "self-contained" ugenDef tree...
2016-02-02T20:00:54 <colinclark> i.e. one that specified the sum unit generator as well as the ugens being summed
2016-02-02T20:01:26 <colinclark> and to support expansion based on any input, not just "phase"
2016-02-02T20:01:42 <colinclark> does that address what you were getting at with your review comments?
2016-02-02T20:03:21 <colinclark> avtar, Justin_o, Bosmon: Do you think we should have a companion Infusion JIRA ticket for avtar\'s new (awesome) pull request? Or is it okay to just track it in the GPII issue tracker? https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-1550
2016-02-02T20:03:49 <Bosmon> colinclark - I didn\'t respond yet
2016-02-02T20:04:04 <Bosmon> Yes, either a change in name or a change in function would be fine
2016-02-02T20:05:52 <colinclark> Bosmon: Honestly, it would be quite a useful expander to have in Flocking itself

2016-02-02T15:55:55 <Bosmon> Justin_o - that would be marvellous
2016-02-02T15:56:08 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay, i\'ll try to carve out some time to do that this afternoon
2016-02-02T15:56:12 <Bosmon> I don\'t know if avtar has already taken a poke using his QI work

2016-02-02T16:03:04 <avtar> Bosmon, Justin_o: i did try that branch and saw failures
2016-02-02T16:03:18 <Bosmon> avtar yes
2016-02-02T16:03:33 <Bosmon> But we\'re interested in the particular failure that the branch is meant to correct
2016-02-02T16:03:42 <Bosmon> The message that says "parseTemplate was supplied an empty template"
2016-02-02T16:06:37 <avtar> Bosmon: no, not that failure :)
2016-02-02T16:06:50 <Bosmon> avtar - cool
2016-02-02T16:07:04 <avtar> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/664
2016-02-02T16:07:28 <Bosmon> The branch is not a UNIVERSAL PANACEA!
2016-02-02T16:07:33 <Bosmon> It corrects ONE ISSUE ONLY : P
2016-02-02T16:07:39 <avtar> if possible please take a look at that pr as well
2016-02-02T16:08:21 <Bosmon> Thanks, avtar - I will check it out, or colinclark will
2016-02-02T16:08:23 <Bosmon> It looks great
2016-02-02T16:08:51 <colinclark> avtar: I\'ll take a look when I get a chance
2016-02-02T16:09:13 <colinclark> I\'m very excited about it

2016-02-02T16:22:34 <colinclark> Hey kasparnet and Bosmon, is this pull ready to be merged? https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/pull/81
2016-02-02T16:22:56 <kasparnet> colinclark: I just addressed the comments ~1 hour ago
2016-02-02T16:23:23 <colinclark> I\'m just going through the 200 unread emails in that mailbox
2016-02-02T16:23:29 <colinclark> and saw that it looked like you had worked on it
2016-02-02T16:23:59 <kasparnet> colinclark: yeah - it\'s pretty simple and probably ready to go
2016-02-02T16:24:09 <kasparnet> but I guess I\'m not really the one to judge
2016-02-02T16:24:10 <kasparnet> :)
2016-02-02T16:24:29 <kasparnet> Bosmon: updated the FLUID-5669 one as well, btw
2016-02-02T16:24:35 <Bosmon> Thanks, kasparnet
2016-02-02T16:33:35 <kasparnet> Bosmon: I\'m testing out your GPII-1318 work
2016-02-02T16:33:47 <kasparnet> but am getting an issue when running the windows acceptance tests
2016-02-02T16:33:49 <kasparnet> Error: Cannot find module \'${universal}/tests/platform/index-windows.js\'
2016-02-02T16:34:04 <Bosmon> kasparnet - you need to test the matched branches together!
2016-02-02T16:34:24 <Bosmon> There is a GPII-1318 branch for universal, and one for windows
2016-02-02T16:34:46 <kasparnet> I thought I was doing that
2016-02-02T16:34:50 <kasparnet> but let me double check
2016-02-02T16:35:38 <Bosmon> kasparnet - the text "${universal}" doesn\'t appear anywhere in the matched branches
2016-02-02T16:35:43 <Bosmon> You will have something stale
2016-02-02T16:35:53 <kasparnet> ok! Cheers

2016-02-02T16:47:26 <kasparnet> I tried following the instructions online
2016-02-02T16:47:37 <kasparnet> but might have missed something
2016-02-02T16:48:44 <Bosmon> kasparnet - yes
2016-02-02T16:48:47 <Bosmon> You missed something big
2016-02-02T16:48:53 <kasparnet> crap
2016-02-02T16:48:54 <Bosmon> You are meant to test with the actually current version of node.js
2016-02-02T16:49:09 <kasparnet> woooooot? as in the latest version?
2016-02-02T16:49:10 <Bosmon> This, after all, is the whole point of the branch : P
2016-02-02T16:49:15 <Bosmon> 4.2.x of some kind

2016-02-02T16:49:33 <Bosmon> !!!
2016-02-02T16:49:36 <kasparnet> sounds insane, but I\'ll do it
2016-02-02T16:50:10 <kasparnet> Bosmon: still 32bit, though, right?
2016-02-02T16:50:31 <Bosmon> kasparnet - sgithens_ has verified that you can NOW USE ANY VARIETY YOU CHOOSE!
2016-02-02T16:50:43 <Bosmon> I think at the weekend he successfully demonstrated this with the 64-bit node for windows
2016-02-02T16:50:53 <kasparnet> that\'s awesome

2016-02-02T17:35:49 <jessm> yes
2016-02-02T17:36:00 <colinclark> that should be changed to refer to Fluid Infusion
2016-02-02T17:36:02 <jessm> his list of presenters and topics in the agenda

2016-02-02T17:36:57 <colinclark> It\'s definitely Gregg\'s concept
2016-02-02T17:37:09 <colinclark> I can\'t remember if it\'s RTF or SiLO, however
