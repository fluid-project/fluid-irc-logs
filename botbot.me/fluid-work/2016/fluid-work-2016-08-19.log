2016-08-19T11:52:45 <dinuka> Hi Justin_o .... need your help for an infusion question
2016-08-19T11:53:30 <dinuka> is there a way to keep the component creation wait for a callback
2016-08-19T11:54:15 <dinuka> Justin_o: for an example to wait till an html template is loaded
2016-08-19T11:54:36 <Justin_o> dinuka: you can do that for a subcomponent
2016-08-19T11:54:48 <dinuka> actually how?
2016-08-19T11:54:50 <Justin_o> using the createOnEvent
2016-08-19T11:55:32 <Justin_o> dinuka: http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/SubcomponentDeclaration.html#basic-subcomponent-declaration
2016-08-19T11:58:38 <dinuka> thanks a looot Justin_o
2016-08-19T11:58:42 <dinuka> I\'l try
2016-08-19T11:58:58 <Justin_o> dinuka: no problem, let me know if you have any trouble with it
2016-08-19T11:59:11 <dinuka> sure Justin_o
2016-08-19T12:01:48 <dinuka> oh... that worked .... thank Justin_o

2016-08-19T14:38:18 <kavyak> Hi
2016-08-19T14:38:47 <kavyak> I am researching on Hardware compatability testing
2016-08-19T14:39:22 <kavyak> Colin: Do we have any docs related to it
2016-08-19T14:40:57 <kavyak> How its approached in previous projects..which helps me put up some points to discuss on monday meeting
2016-08-19T14:51:17 <kavyak> colinclark: can you suggest some pointers
2016-08-19T14:51:47 <colinclark> hiya kavyak
2016-08-19T14:51:54 <colinclark> hmm
2016-08-19T14:52:04 <colinclark> I can\'t think of any cases where we\'ve taken hardward compatibility into account
2016-08-19T14:52:15 <colinclark> the closest thing I can think of is Justin_o\'s A-Grade browser list
2016-08-19T14:52:28 <colinclark> where he defined a set of browser technologies that we\'d commit to testing with
2016-08-19T14:53:11 <kavyak> ok..
2016-08-19T14:53:20 * michelled has left the channel
2016-08-19T14:53:35 <kavyak> HC testing need to be done in Phases
2016-08-19T14:54:17 <kavyak> we want to have a tool which takes a snapshot of users hardware configuration
2016-08-19T14:54:21 <kavyak> and reports
2016-08-19T14:54:44 <Justin_o> kavyak: here\'s an example of the browser support from Infusion https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/docs/Browser+Support The mobile stuff is pretty out of date there though and will need to be updated prior to our Infusion 2.0 release.
2016-08-19T14:54:47 <kavyak> i have researched some tools for this
2016-08-19T14:56:34 <kavyak> Thanks Justin..I will go through the link
2016-08-19T15:05:53 <colinclark> kavyak: Cool, that sounds interesting
2016-08-19T15:05:57 <colinclark> what tools have you found for this?
2016-08-19T15:06:35 <colinclark> I wonder if stegru knows about any Windows tools that will help take a snapshot of the characteristics of the machine
2016-08-19T15:06:41 <colinclark> he might have some ideas?
2016-08-19T15:07:00 <kavyak> installrite is good tool but its not supported now
2016-08-19T15:07:24 <kavyak> advanced installer is another tool
2016-08-19T15:09:11 <kavyak> the trick is to find the tool which take snapshot and sends report to us where we can keep matrix of on which different hw the installer is installed on
2016-08-19T15:12:52 <kavyak> The tool might be wrapped with installer MSI file as a package
2016-08-19T15:14:04 <kavyak> Stegru: Do you have any suggestions?
2016-08-19T15:15:33 <stegru> erm
2016-08-19T15:17:06 <stegru> nothing i can think of

2016-08-19T15:26:54 <kavyak> ok..Thanks Steve
2016-08-19T15:29:08 <bens__> kavyak, colinclark stegru, not a tool really, but maybe the info can be scraped from device manager through a powershell script
2016-08-19T15:29:16 <colinclark> bens__!!!
2016-08-19T15:29:20 <colinclark> hi!
2016-08-19T15:29:24 <bens__> colinclark, hello!
2016-08-19T15:29:31 <colinclark> :)
2016-08-19T15:30:05 <colinclark> kavyak: What do you think of scripting with the device manager?
2016-08-19T15:31:02 <kavyak> Yes..we can do this with powershell script
2016-08-19T15:31:11 <colinclark> have you written any powershell scripts before? I haven\'t
2016-08-19T15:31:21 <colinclark> I know simonjb was a huge powershell fan :)
2016-08-19T15:31:35 <kavyak> I didn\'t either :)
2016-08-19T15:31:54 <bens__> think of powershell as the power of the .NET framework from a command prompt
2016-08-19T15:31:54 <colinclark> I gather it\'s a very interesting approach to scripting
2016-08-19T15:31:58 <colinclark> right
2016-08-19T15:32:05 <bens__> big difference is that it pipes strongly typed objects around instead of "just text"
2016-08-19T15:32:17 <colinclark> fascinating
2016-08-19T15:32:34 <colinclark> So kavyak, just so I understand...
2016-08-19T15:32:43 <bens__> a potential problem with this approach though.. if we\'re talking about gathering device info from machines we don\'t control.. is that powershell i believe is disabled by default
2016-08-19T15:32:58 <colinclark> ahhhh
2016-08-19T15:33:01 <colinclark> the idea is that we will eventually give our friends and partners and neighbours and maybe grandparents a copy of the GPII installer?
2016-08-19T15:33:12 <colinclark> and they\'ll install it and run through a very simple set of tasks to verify it?
2016-08-19T15:33:28 <colinclark> and we\'ll somehow take a snapshot of the details of their computer so we can determine which environments might have issues?
2016-08-19T15:34:11 <kavyak> :)
2016-08-19T15:34:47 * stegru has quit
2016-08-19T15:35:30 <bens__> colinclark, kavyak, a *signed* powershell script would probably run pretty reliably
2016-08-19T15:35:32 <kavyak> This is done in 3 phases. 1 phase is by Tester. 2 phase is by APCP team  may be UX team as well. 3 phase is users in pilots
2016-08-19T15:35:59 <kavyak> 100 systems at most is targeted in 3 phase
2016-08-19T15:36:02 <colinclark> wow
2016-08-19T15:36:03 <colinclark> cool
2016-08-19T15:36:18 <kavyak> we need to think if we still need it after 3 phase
2016-08-19T15:37:40 <kavyak> Thanks bens_
2016-08-19T15:39:38 <alanharnum> powershell is pretty neat
2016-08-19T15:39:46 <alanharnum> sort of excited to hear it\'s getting open sourced
2016-08-19T15:40:32 <alanharnum> i never spent a huge amount of time working with it, but as bens__ describes there are parts of it that are UNIX-y pipes but with full-on objects
2016-08-19T15:40:40 <alanharnum> which is pretty cool
