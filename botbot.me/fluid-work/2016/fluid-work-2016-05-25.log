b"2016-05-25T23:27:31 <avtar> https://github.com/colinbdclark/universal/blob/GPII-1318/Dockerfile#L1
2016-05-25T23:27:37 <avtar> yes, we should bump that version
2016-05-25T23:27:49 <colinclark> is that the only change I need to make?
2016-05-25T23:28:15 <colinclark> and is there an inclusivedesign/nodejs container for 4.4.3?
2016-05-25T23:28:57 <avtar> colinclark: yes on both counts
2016-05-25T23:29:10 <colinclark> ok, that's great
2016-05-25T23:29:10 <avtar> https://hub.docker.com/r/inclusivedesign/nodejs/tags/
2016-05-25T23:29:24 <avtar> freshly baked as well
2016-05-25T23:29:27 <colinclark> yes
2016-05-25T23:29:29 <colinclark> very new
2016-05-25T23:29:31 <colinclark> this is probably a dumb question, avtar
2016-05-25T23:29:38 <colinclark> but what is the universal docker container used for?
2016-05-25T23:29:49 <colinclark> can one deploy universal alone?
2016-05-25T23:30:23 <avtar> colinclark: it's really just meant to be used by the preferences server and flow manager docker images
2016-05-25T23:30:26 <colinclark> and a second, hopefully less dumb question--can I test the Docker configuration somehow prior to merging it?
2016-05-25T23:30:32 <colinclark> ah, that makes sense to me
2016-05-25T23:30:36 <avtar> https://github.com/gpii-ops/docker-preferences-server/blob/master/Dockerfile#L1
2016-05-25T23:30:44 <colinclark> yes, that makes sense :)
2016-05-25T23:31:12 <avtar> but if you were to create a new gpii component and needed a docker image built for it then the universal one would be a good one to base yours own
2016-05-25T23:31:15 <avtar> *on
2016-05-25T23:31:23 <colinclark> right
2016-05-25T23:41:47 <avtar> colinclark: i'm about to switch offices and should be online again in an hour if you need any help
2016-05-25T23:41:53 <colinclark> ok cool
2016-05-25T23:41:56 <colinclark> one super quick question
2016-05-25T23:41:58 <colinclark> avtar: If I install the Docker for Mac beta that I've been holding back on installing, can I test that the Docker image is actually built correctly here?
2016-05-25T23:42:56 <avtar> yes i can't think of a reason why that wouldn't work
2016-05-25T23:43:33 <colinclark> ok great
2016-05-25T23:43:36 <colinclark> that'll be fun :)
2016-05-25T23:43:43 <colinclark> have a nice bike ride home
2016-05-25T23:44:38 <avtar> we use docker 1.9.1 in the centos vagrant box
2016-05-25T23:44:55 <avtar> it'll be a stroll home today :/
2016-05-25T23:45:08 <avtar> i thought it was going to pour so i walked to the office
2016-05-25T23:45:48 <colinclark> aha

2016-05-25T20:05:42 <gtirloni> i'm trying to find a story which i'm not sure was created in twine but now the format feels familiar
2016-05-25T20:05:50 <gtirloni> about a man going down a cave, iirc
2016-05-25T20:06:10 <gtirloni> i remember the added sound, very carefully placed and the light effects really complemented it
2016-05-25T20:08:41 <gtirloni> why can't google search interpret my fading memories and find this page already..

2016-05-25T23:19:38 <avtar> sure
2016-05-25T23:20:02 <colinclark> I'm just going to push some changes up to a branch
2016-05-25T23:20:07 <colinclark> gimme one sec
2016-05-25T23:21:32 * Justin_o has quit
2016-05-25T23:21:50 <colinclark> avtar: I'm working in a branch based off Bosmon's GPII-1318 here: https://github.com/colinbdclark/universal/tree/GPII-1318
2016-05-25T23:22:25 <colinclark> I just realized that this branch hasn't been tracking either our Docker or Vagrant automation at all
2016-05-25T23:22:35 <colinclark> https://github.com/colinbdclark/universal/blob/GPII-1318/Dockerfile
2016-05-25T23:23:00 <colinclark> Sorry, no, I'm wrong
2016-05-25T23:23:22 <colinclark> it looks like the Vagrant vars have been updated for Node 4.4.3
2016-05-25T23:23:41 <colinclark> But the Dockerfile looks out of date
2016-05-25T23:24:00 <colinclark> Can you coach me through updates to this, or is there a branch somewhere with the requisite changes?
2016-05-25T23:24:05 <colinclark> or does it not matter at all?
2016-05-25T23:24:40 <avtar> colinclark: are you comparing the dockerfile with universal/master?
2016-05-25T23:25:07 <avtar> they appear to be identical
2016-05-25T23:25:14 <avtar> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/Dockerfile
2016-05-25T23:25:18 <avtar> https://github.com/colinbdclark/universal/blob/GPII-1318/Dockerfile
2016-05-25T23:25:49 <avtar> ah
2016-05-25T23:25:55 <colinclark> they appear to be identical, right?
2016-05-25T23:25:56 <avtar> do you mean docker-vars.yml?
2016-05-25T23:26:03 <colinclark> No, I mean the Docker file
2016-05-25T23:26:19 <colinclark> doesn't it appear as if the Docer file is configured for Node 0.10.44?
2016-05-25T23:26:31 <avtar> the one in your branch is missing this step https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/provisioning/docker-vars.yml#L5
2016-05-25T23:26:45 <colinclark> yes, excellently
2016-05-25T23:26:52 <colinclark> deduping is no longer neccessary, thankfully
2016-05-25T23:26:59 <colinclark> necessary
2016-05-25T23:27:30 <avtar> ok

2016-05-25T14:43:46 <Justin_o> Bosmon: are we switching to eslint?
2016-05-25T14:44:43 <the-t-in-rtf> I have been trying it in parallel in gpii-express to give us the option to switch, but no one is "switching" as far as I know.
2016-05-25T14:45:00 <the-t-in-rtf> it\'s a longer-term discussion, in other words.
2016-05-25T14:45:29 <the-t-in-rtf> I can see clear reasons to migrate long-term, which is why I want to at least confirm that we can meet our current standards using ESlint.
2016-05-25T14:45:40 <the-t-in-rtf> it\'s more of a test at the moment, IMO.
2016-05-25T14:45:57 <Bosmon> I think we may as well do it shortly, since I see that it does indeed do everything we require from JSHint, as well as the features which I hacked it to support in my branch work on JSHint
2016-05-25T14:46:10 * the-t-in-rtf has quit
2016-05-25T14:46:40 <Bosmon> I\'ll prepare a pull that we can evaluate
2016-05-25T14:46:45 <Justin_o> Bosmon: that makes sense too. It does seem to be the one that is being used a lot these days too.. so i imagine the support is good
2016-05-25T14:47:02 <Bosmon> Its engineering quality is vastly better than JSLint or JSHint
2016-05-25T14:47:11 <Justin_o> Bosmon: cool... could be a good time to re-evaluate what we check against too
2016-05-25T14:47:38 <Justin_o> JSHint was probably a direct port of JSLint at some point... maybe that\'s why
2016-05-25T14:48:44 <Bosmon> Well, JSHint at least has test cases :)
2016-05-25T14:49:06 <Bosmon> Crockford doesn\'t believe in those
2016-05-25T14:49:16 <Bosmon> Hard to believe this was the man we considered an example : P
2016-05-25T14:49:39 <Justin_o> I find it hard to believe that he doesn\'t believe in tests when he stresses syntax issues so much
2016-05-25T14:50:45 * Dinuka joined the channel
2016-05-25T14:51:22 <Bosmon> Well, there are all kinds of oddball argumentation out there :)
2016-05-25T14:51:37 <Bosmon> I recently dug up the email from 2006 where I tried to explain to colinclark why RSF didn\'t have any test cases ....

2016-05-25T15:47:11 <wannabeCitizen> sgithens: LOL, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a musical, but the theater piece went well. Checkout pics - quantifiedselfless.tumblr.com
2016-05-25T15:47:17 <the-t-in-rtf> From what I\'ve seen looking into feature parity, and their issue tracking, the ESLint community is pretty healthy.  You can see from the fine grained rule sets that they value supporting all three sides of these "binary" discussions.
2016-05-25T15:47:29 <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. "it has to be this way", "it has to be that way", or "I don\'t care"

2016-05-25T15:55:53 <the-t-in-rtf> It\'s a refreshing alternative to things like JSHint 2.5.0, where the decision is taken for everyone and the alternative is completely destroyed.
2016-05-25T15:56:51 <Bosmon> Having responsibility for each class of check broken out into a separate file is also a healthy piece of engineering

2016-05-25T15:57:51 <the-t-in-rtf> I also liked what I read about their approach to plugins, it seems unlikely we would need to fork anything.
2016-05-25T15:58:21 <Bosmon> As opposed to the single giant junkheap of code in jslint/jshint
2016-05-25T15:58:45 <Bosmon> Really Crockford writes the most appalling code
2016-05-25T16:02:42 <the-t-in-rtf> Their plugin docs are very clear, and include details on making your plugin use their test runner:  http://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/working-with-plugins
