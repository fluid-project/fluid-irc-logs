2016-03-31T15:45:20 <kasparnet> unless ofc tuesday works better for you
2016-03-31T15:45:23 <kasparnet> then that\'s fine as well
2016-03-31T15:45:29 <kasparnet> whichever you prefer
2016-03-31T15:45:29 <Bosmon> Yes, best to push out to Tuesday
2016-03-31T15:45:33 <kasparnet> ok cool
2016-03-31T15:45:35 <Bosmon> I\'ll be back to full strength by then

2016-03-31T18:17:50 <avtar> Justin_o: one sec, gonna take a look

2016-03-31T18:18:26 <Justin_o> jhung: i left a comment on your pull request to the john travoltage html repo
2016-03-31T18:19:17 <jhung> yes Justin_o I\'m investigating it now. For some reason the alerts aren\'t working the way I expect.
2016-03-31T18:19:46 <Justin_o> jhung: okay

2016-03-31T18:39:18 <avtar> Justin_o: i think should be the url http://localhost:8888/demos/inlineEdit/
2016-03-31T18:39:51 * jhung1 joined the channel
2016-03-31T18:40:03 <Justin_o> avtar: it\'s probably because i\'m serving the directory above it
2016-03-31T18:40:09 <Justin_o> so that i can serve all of my projects
2016-03-31T18:41:31 <avtar> ah gotcha
2016-03-31T18:41:41 <avtar> i was sharing just my infusion git working directory
2016-03-31T18:42:26 <Justin_o> avtar: okay, are you getting the same error as me though?
2016-03-31T18:42:44 * jhung joined the channel

2016-03-31T18:45:39 <Justin_o> avtar: so you are getting foundation.css loaded
2016-03-31T18:45:45 <avtar> yes
2016-03-31T18:45:47 <Justin_o> and the demo looks like it does from the build site?
2016-03-31T18:45:52 <avtar> yup
2016-03-31T18:46:03 <Justin_o> avtar: can you clear your cache and try it
2016-03-31T18:46:11 <wale> interesting to see that this whole debacle may have started over a module name dispute?
2016-03-31T18:47:58 <avtar> Justin_o: i tried the same request in an incognito window and it worked
2016-03-31T18:48:30 <avtar> i\'m on a call at the moment but i can screen share in a few mins if you\'re interested
2016-03-31T18:49:58 <Justin_o> avtar: sure, it\'s still not working for me, i tried in another browser too and still getting the same issue
2016-03-31T18:56:07 <michelled> jhung: how\'s it going?
2016-03-31T18:56:42 <jhung> hey michelled. going okay.

2016-03-31T19:04:32 <jhung> alanharnum: ok. Are there designs?
2016-03-31T19:04:58 <alanharnum> you\'ll also need to be running the back end service or i can do some tweaking so the demo works with a stub file
2016-03-31T19:05:12 <alanharnum> (the latter is probably easier for styling purposes)
2016-03-31T19:05:14 <alanharnum> yeah one sec
2016-03-31T19:05:29 <jhung> thanks. alanharnum. I\'m all for the easy method. :)
2016-03-31T19:05:56 <alanharnum> pages 15/16/17 of https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bxy2B0Y99qCuWTg4VjU5MWZlVGc/view
2016-03-31T19:06:12 <alanharnum> we only care about the graph appearance
2016-03-31T19:06:28 <alanharnum> gimme a few minutes to tweak the demo so it doesn\'t require the back end
2016-03-31T19:08:36 <jhung> Justin_o: I\'ve updated my pull req to you. Had to do some testing to make sure everything worked okay.
2016-03-31T19:09:09 <Justin_o> jhung: okay thanks

b'2016-03-31T14:27:42 <Katy> cindyli I was able to successful clone with the GPII-1318 branch.  Your directions were very good and helpful.     I had to be in the git shell for the git clone to be successful. The second was that I had to install Visual Studio 2013 for the npm install to work.  I then followed Antranig\'s email on how to install the GPII Windows.
2016-03-31T14:27:47 <kasparnet> Bosmon: i refuse any knowledge of such a thing
2016-03-31T14:27:57 <kasparnet> :)
2016-03-31T14:28:01 * PaliwalSparsh has left the channel
2016-03-31T14:28:07 <Bosmon> Justin_o - did we end up creating a "how to run the Infusion tests" page?
2016-03-31T14:28:09 <cindyli> cool, Katy. congrats!!
2016-03-31T14:28:18 <Bosmon> I remember lots of the GSoC students ran into the tar
2016-03-31T14:29:15 <Bosmon> Katy - congrats yes :)
2016-03-31T14:29:23 <Bosmon> Katy - we should see if dsharma is still having problems
2016-03-31T14:31:03 <Katy> Bosmon and cindyli   I started node gpii.js on Windows. Then did the sammy login.  Which changed my entire windows application to be huge.  Then I tried to do the sammy logout. The browser said it was successful.  But my machine did not change back to normal.  Dipish said it is a known problem.  Is there a easier way to get my machine back to normal. I ended up having to reboot.
2016-03-31T14:31:06 <kasparnet> Bosmon: oh, I just saw this: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/#how-do-i-run-tests
2016-03-31T14:32:27 <Bosmon> Hi Katy - yes, we are sorry for this
2016-03-31T14:32:39 <Bosmon> This is listed under https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-481 which is actually one of the issues that dsharma is tasked with
2016-03-31T14:32:54 <Bosmon> It is safter to always run the Windows tests from within a VM
2016-03-31T14:33:14 <Bosmon> It\'s one of the issues that has been "urgent" for quite a while, but we haven\'t had the resources so far to deal with it
2016-03-31T14:33:39 <cindyli> kasparnet: that section is the instruction for running infusion tests across multiple browsers
2016-03-31T14:33:48 <Katy> Thank you Bosmon for the info.
2016-03-31T14:34:13 <Justin_o> Bosmon, kasparnet: I think that\'s pretty much it for the testing.. other than the manual test pages. The demos and manual tests also have information on them about what they are expected to do
2016-03-31T14:34:30 <Bosmon> Justin_o - we really need a page explaining to people that they must either:
2016-03-31T14:34:43 <Bosmon> i) Use the following page to adjust their browser security settings: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Browser+settings+to+support+local+Ajax+calls
2016-03-31T14:34:54 <Bosmon> or ii) run the tests when served via a local web browser
2016-03-31T14:35:06 <Bosmon> Since this is information we end up repeating to everyone a couple of times a month : P
2016-03-31T14:35:26 <avtar> Katy: here\'s a test vm if you would like to try this approach https://github.com/gpii/windows#test-vm
2016-03-31T14:35:57 <colinclark> Katy, avtar: I can attest to the fact that it\'s a pretty awesome way to run the GPII...
2016-03-31T14:36:15 <Katy> Thanks. I will look at that test vm
2016-03-31T14:36:26 <colinclark> check out the code, run "vagrant up", wait a while and then you\'ve a fully provisioned VM with the GPII inside it
2016-03-31T14:36:56 <Bosmon> Other than the further step of installing Virtualbox
2016-03-31T14:37:23 <colinclark> hey kasparnet speaking of vagrant...
2016-03-31T14:37:31 <colinclark> let me show you some hotness for your testing
2016-03-31T14:37:49 <colinclark> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion#run-tests-using-browsers-installed-in-a-vm
2016-03-31T14:38:16 <colinclark> It does all the work of setting up web servers and the like for you and running the Infusion tests in multiple browsers
2016-03-31T14:38:22 <kasparnet> colinclark: trying that out know :)
2016-03-31T14:38:55 <kasparnet> Bosmon, cindyli, Justin_o: in the meantime - running the tests in firefox with strict origin policy off still freezes in the full preview test
2016-03-31T14:39:12 <kasparnet> I\'ll try running it in a webserver and see what happens
2016-03-31T14:39:22 <cindyli> ah ha, trying that one
2016-03-31T14:39:42 <colinclark> What\'s great about this vagrant setup is that it also helps avoid Bosmon sticking his tongue out at you for no reason
2016-03-31T14:39:45 <colinclark> and it\'s really awesome
2016-03-31T14:39:49 <colinclark> I mean, avtar\'s brilliant
2016-03-31T14:40:03 <colinclark> anyone who has run Infusion tests knows that we support a lot of browsers
2016-03-31T14:40:11 <colinclark> and you can just run a few commands, sit back with a coffee
2016-03-31T14:40:19 <colinclark> and watch your browsers open, run tests, close again
2016-03-31T14:40:38 <cindyli> kasparnet: i was running the test with a web server, seems working fine. how does it go when you run with a web server? what error do u get?
2016-03-31T14:40:41 <colinclark> and as long as you aren\'t running a 100 year old OS like Bosmon, it all just works
2016-03-31T14:41:01 <colinclark> oh, and speaking of web servers and vagrant, avtar...
2016-03-31T14:41:31 <colinclark> I was able to confirm that your new vagrant-web-server package works reasonably well serving up my 200 code repositories
2016-03-31T14:41:38 <avtar> ah
2016-03-31T14:41:43 <avtar> so it was the 4 gig video?
2016-03-31T14:41:44 <colinclark> As long as it isn\'t required to serve up a 4 GB video file
2016-03-31T14:41:45 <colinclark> yeah
2016-03-31T14:41:49 <avtar> ok good to know
2016-03-31T14:41:50 <colinclark> which is, admittedly, a showstopper for me
2016-03-31T14:42:00 <colinclark> since I often write software that processes 4 GB video files :)
2016-03-31T14:42:15 <colinclark> I did notice that it feels slower to load pages than my native nginx instance
2016-03-31T14:42:19 <Justin_o> avtar: when can we get the vagrant web server into infusion
2016-03-31T14:42:30 <colinclark> I wonder if there\'s some latency between vbox and the host, networking-wise?
2016-03-31T14:42:42 <Justin_o> which should satisfy, with some README updates, Bosmon\'s request for docs on how to run infusion demos
2016-03-31T14:43:20 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2016-03-31T14:43:36 <avtar> Justin_o: do you mean a server not for running tests?
2016-03-31T14:45:00 <Justin_o> avtar: yes
2016-03-31T14:46:22 <kasparnet> cindyli, Bosmon: still failing - but from having my webserver crash this time :O
2016-03-31T14:46:53 <cindyli> what error do you get, kasparnet
2016-03-31T14:47:30 <cindyli> and, you need a more robust web server :)
2016-03-31T14:48:12 <kasparnet> I know - I just took the simplest one I could find
2016-03-31T14:48:18 <kasparnet> ie. npm install webserver :)
2016-03-31T14:48:27 <kasparnet> anyway - this is the error message I\'m getting
2016-03-31T14:48:28 <kasparnet> http://pastebin.com/aGCUCH4d
2016-03-31T14:48:55 <kasparnet> I\'m wondering if it has to do with the double "//"
2016-03-31T14:49:07 <avtar> Justin_o: i\'ve been working on a couple of qi demo related tasks that should automate the web server setup. colinclark helped test it last night. i have a few more changes and docs that i\'m going to push shortly and then you should be able to try it as well.
2016-03-31T14:50:58 <kasparnet> cindyli: ^
2016-03-31T14:51:28 <avtar> kasparnet: you could try this https://github.com/avtar/vagrant-web-server
2016-03-31T14:51:35 <Bosmon> I\'ve got a nickel here - does anyone want to chip in to a fund to buy kasparnet a proper web server?
2016-03-31T14:51:43 <Bosmon> I\'ve heard that they\'re quite readily available these days
2016-03-31T14:51:54 * dsharma has quit
2016-03-31T14:51:59 <Bosmon> Perhaps we can get him to use Microsoft\'s "IIS" .....
2016-03-31T14:52:01 <avtar> kasparnet: you\'ll need to run these two commands: export VM_HOST_DIR=/path/to/your/infusion/dir && vagrant up
2016-03-31T14:52:10 <kasparnet> nothing wrong with being lazy :)
2016-03-31T14:52:17 <kasparnet> cool cheers avtar, I\'ll try it out
2016-03-31T14:52:33 * dsharma joined the channel
2016-03-31T14:52:44 <avtar> before starting you should make sure port 8888 isn\'t in use
2016-03-31T14:53:11 <avtar> or set the port using a VM_HOST_TCP_PORT env var
2016-03-31T14:55:04 <cindyli> kasparnet: that\'s possible. the double slashes in urls should be fixed anyway, although they appear harmless with some web servers. i will look up if we already have a jira for it. if not, i will create one
2016-03-31T14:56:07 <avtar> kasparnet: forgot to mention that you should visit http://localhost:8888 once your shell prompt returns
2016-03-31T14:57:48 <colinclark> Bosmon: I\'m happy to donate to the "Buy kasparnet IIS" fund
2016-03-31T14:58:01 <colinclark> Such a worthy cause
2016-03-31T14:58:13 <kasparnet> YAY!! I\'ll be rich Rich RICH!!
2016-03-31T14:58:19 <avtar> i heard you can run mssql on linux now
2016-03-31T14:58:43 <avtar> maybe iis soon
2016-03-31T15:02:12 <colinclark> avtar: oooh!
2016-03-31T15:02:44 <alanharnum> frontpage for linux plz
2016-03-31T15:02:53 <colinclark> I can\'t wait until Microsoft ports IE6 to Linux, too!
2016-03-31T15:02:57 <jhung> Justin_o: you recall I was having a problem with sliders in IE 11 on Win 10? It seems that you need to have the html served in order for them to render properly. Otherwise they appear as text input fields. Not sure if it\'s just a VM issue or if it\'s true for IE11 on Win 10 in general.
2016-03-31T15:02:59 <colinclark> Full stack Linux web development!
2016-03-31T15:03:23 <alanharnum> being able to run IE natively on Linux would be great for testing tbh
2016-03-31T15:04:12 <Justin_o> jhung: thanks for tracking that down... what strange behaviour though
2016-03-31T15:06:17 <Bosmon> alanharnum MacWrite II for Windows 7 please :)
2016-03-31T15:09:55 <cindyli> kasparnet: did you have problem with running: tests/framework-tests/preferences/html/FullNoPreviewPrefsEditor-test.html
2016-03-31T15:10:01 <cindyli> or
2016-03-31T15:10:01 <cindyli> tests/framework-tests/preferences/html/SeparatedPanelPrefsEditor-test.html
2016-03-31T15:10:17 <cindyli> those tests load templates and message bundles with double slashes too
2016-03-31T15:10:52 <kasparnet> cindyli: nope, only the full preview one
2016-03-31T15:11:01 <kasparnet> commenting that one out, all tests passed for me
2016-03-31T15:11:06 <cindyli> ah ha
2016-03-31T15:11:15 <cindyli> so, it may not be from double slashes
2016-03-31T15:11:26 <kasparnet> nope, guess not
2016-03-31T15:11:49 <kasparnet> running with avtar\'s fancy box and it seems to be working
2016-03-31T15:11:55 <jhung> Justin_o: I sent you a pull req for John Travoltage that includes the updates to the markup.
2016-03-31T15:11:59 <avtar> great success :D
2016-03-31T15:12:25 <cindyli> kasparnet: would you be able to create a jira with how to produce the failure?
2016-03-31T15:12:35 <kasparnet> yup, I\'ll do that
2016-03-31T15:12:50 <cindyli> i\'ve created one for double slashes - https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5881
2016-03-31T15:12:55 <cindyli> thanks, kasparnet

2016-03-31T15:25:37 * dsharma has quit
2016-03-31T15:25:48 <cindyli> one "node" should be removed?
2016-03-31T15:25:53 <kasparnet> oh yeah
2016-03-31T15:26:06 <Bosmon> Thanks for helping out with FLUID-5294 btw KASPARDNITT :)
2016-03-31T15:26:31 <kasparnet> thanks for catching that, cindyli - fixed
2016-03-31T15:26:35 <cindyli> thanks
2016-03-31T15:26:51 <kasparnet> Bosmon: I was planning on spending some time on the model transformations
2016-03-31T15:27:03 <kasparnet> Bosmon: and was wondering if you had any priorities with the JIRAs
2016-03-31T15:27:16 <kasparnet> Bosmon: I need to do the inverse transformations one sooner or later
2016-03-31T15:27:21 <Bosmon> This one is a big one
2016-03-31T15:27:24 <kasparnet> and probably the input paths one
2016-03-31T15:27:41 <Bosmon> I prepared the ground a little for it with my previous round of updates
2016-03-31T15:27:42 <kasparnet> but wouldn\'t mind spending time on some of the smaller ones first
2016-03-31T15:27:49 <Bosmon> BUt it\'s great to have it finally knocked on the head
2016-03-31T15:27:50 <kasparnet> to refresh my mind on the MT stuff
2016-03-31T15:27:59 <Bosmon> Also it\'s good for us to be doing all this stuff at the same time
2016-03-31T15:29:42 <Bosmon> Since my fix for https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5867 already implied that we would have to review all the transforms within the GPII
2016-03-31T15:30:26 <Bosmon> My fixes there also prepared the ground for fixing transform inversion as well
2016-03-31T15:30:32 <Bosmon> At least all the junk is inside a single utility now
2016-03-31T15:31:15 <colinclark> wow, this is exciting, Bosmon and kasparnet
2016-03-31T15:32:52 <kasparnet> colinclark: yeah very!! It\'s like going back 4 years in time to the grand MT conversations in San Diego!

2016-03-31T15:43:21 <Bosmon> kasparnet - rather pressed today with some writing
2016-03-31T15:43:34 <Bosmon> I guess Tuesday is your next workday?
2016-03-31T15:44:46 <kasparnet> Bosmon: I can probably do tomorrow as well... It\'s gonna be up towards 50mph windows, so no surf :)

2016-03-31T13:19:15 <cindyli> hi Bosmon
2016-03-31T13:19:24 <Bosmon> Hi there cindyli
2016-03-31T13:20:13 <cindyli> Bosmon: do you say the-t-in-rtf\'s email to the list regarding the meeting notes from APCP security meeting: what backend database should be used as Tony recently switched from using couchDB to nodejs
2016-03-31T13:20:38 * Awesome_A joined the channel
2016-03-31T13:20:39 <Bosmon> cindyli - I\'m not sure what is meant by "switching from couchDB to nodejs"
2016-03-31T13:21:15 <Bosmon> It looks like the-t-in-rtf can\'t interpret this either
2016-03-31T13:21:19 <cindyli> i wrote that \'cuz when we talked about if we should use couchdb, you mentioned the-t-in-rtf recently made some changes at using couchdb. did i misunderstand ur comment?
2016-03-31T13:21:30 <cindyli> now i cannot either :)
2016-03-31T13:21:34 <Bosmon> cindyli - I think you did, yes
2016-03-31T13:21:44 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf is still using CouchDB intensively
2016-03-31T13:22:10 <cindyli> ok, i will reply to the list to clarify this. thanks
2016-03-31T13:22:15 <Bosmon> We have not yet strongly considered any alternatives, although I turned up a possibility last night that I will be talking to him about shortly
2016-03-31T13:22:34 <cindyli> Bosmon: can i be in that talk too?
2016-03-31T13:22:39 <Bosmon> Oh sure
2016-03-31T13:22:43 <the-t-in-rtf> uhhh
2016-03-31T13:22:44 <Bosmon> I\'ll add you when we get to that point
2016-03-31T13:22:48 <the-t-in-rtf> That\'s good.
2016-03-31T13:22:55 <the-t-in-rtf> You and I have a lot of other stuff to talk about.
2016-03-31T13:22:56 <the-t-in-rtf> :)
2016-03-31T13:22:56 <cindyli> i also would like to meet with you guys to talk about the account management system in general
2016-03-31T13:23:12 <the-t-in-rtf> Sounds great.  My week has been utter chaos (sick toddler), but next week should be fine.
2016-03-31T13:23:22 <the-t-in-rtf> I can meet during our overlap next week.
2016-03-31T13:23:26 <the-t-in-rtf> Monday is best.
2016-03-31T13:23:54 <cindyli> Monday works for me. what time is good for you, the-t-in-rtf? and Bosmon?
2016-03-31T13:24:11 <Bosmon> Monday might not be great for me since I will be travelling in the early part of the day
2016-03-31T13:24:49 <the-t-in-rtf> I can meet until around 16:00 CET on Tuesday.
2016-03-31T13:24:57 <the-t-in-rtf> same on Wednesday.
2016-03-31T13:25:06 <the-t-in-rtf> and until 17:30 CET on Thursday.
2016-03-31T13:25:16 <Bosmon> Ok
2016-03-31T13:25:22 <Bosmon> 3pm CET IS good for me Tuesday
2016-03-31T13:25:32 <the-t-in-rtf> That\'s perfect, so that we can discuss before the next security meeting.
2016-03-31T13:25:36 <the-t-in-rtf> I will send an invite now.
2016-03-31T13:25:59 <cindyli> 3pm CET === 9AM EST, so it works for me too

2016-03-31T13:27:34 <cindyli> gtirloni, avtar, do we need to book vidyo if we wanna use fluid-standup at 9AM next Tuesday?
2016-03-31T13:27:43 <gtirloni> cindyli: no
2016-03-31T13:27:47 <cindyli> cool
2016-03-31T13:27:48 <gtirloni> no booking system :)
2016-03-31T13:27:53 <Bosmon> Surely we can just use one of our..... ROOMS.... anyway
2016-03-31T13:28:05 <gtirloni> yep, plenty of other rooms
2016-03-31T13:28:07 <Bosmon> Using this strange vidyo "room" system.....
2016-03-31T13:28:13 <cindyli> the-t-in-rtf, Bosmon, let\'s meet in fluid-standup. in case it\'s in use, we can use my room

2016-03-31T13:33:13 <michelled> thanks

2016-03-31T13:33:38 <cindyli> of course, and myself will be in that meeting too
2016-03-31T13:34:43 <michelled> sounds good cindyli - yes, thanks for letting me know
2016-03-31T13:35:20 <cindyli> that\'s great. thanks, michelled. the meeting will be at vidyo fluid-standup room
2016-03-31T13:36:02 <michelled> great, I put it in my calendar
