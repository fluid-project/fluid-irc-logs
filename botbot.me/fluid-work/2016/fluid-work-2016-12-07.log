b'2016-12-07T16:59:16 <gloob> exactly
2016-12-07T16:59:26 <gtirloni> or any linux desktop
2016-12-07T16:59:59 <avtar> although getting a lenovo x230 from ebay is fairly affordable and could serve as a ci runner capable of testing windows apps
2016-12-07T17:00:14 <avtar> what gtirloni said :P
2016-12-07T17:00:23 <colinclark> well, this is great
2016-12-07T17:00:34 <colinclark> and avtar am I correct that we\'re really looking at a zero-Jenkins world?
2016-12-07T17:00:48 <colinclark> once we prove (hopefully) that GitLab can replace it?
2016-12-07T17:01:06 <avtar> yes, then there would be zero jenkins involved
2016-12-07T17:01:06 <amatas> I believe that we could forget the word "Jenkins"
2016-12-07T17:02:02 <gtirloni> avtar: does gitlab ci provide its own runners? i couldn\'t find that
2016-12-07T17:02:20 <avtar> gtirloni: yes, they provide shared runners
2016-12-07T17:02:36 <avtar> i believe those are capable of launching containers
2016-12-07T17:02:37 <gtirloni> amatas: i\'ll never forget the world "jenkins".. unless there\'s a cure for PTSD ;)
2016-12-07T17:02:58 <amatas> haha
2016-12-07T17:03:04 <gtirloni> avtar: cool, that could test web apps and desktop apps that don\'t depend on a full fledged desktop environment, right? through Xfvb
2016-12-07T17:03:29 <avtar> gtirloni: https://about.gitlab.com/2016/04/05/shared-runners/ "All your builds run on Digital Ocean 4GB instances, with CoreOS and the latest Docker Engine installed."
2016-12-07T17:03:40 <gtirloni> very nice
2016-12-07T17:03:57 <gloob> *belive*
2016-12-07T17:03:58 <gloob> :D
2016-12-07T17:04:19 <gtirloni> gloob and his doubts!!!
2016-12-07T17:04:35 <colinclark> Now they\'re just cute little doubitos
2016-12-07T17:04:49 <gloob> seriously, it is not funny
2016-12-07T17:04:55 <colinclark> pretty sure it is
2016-12-07T17:05:07 <amatas> :D
2016-12-07T17:05:15 <avtar> gtirloni: xfvb could be one option but i stopped looking into that in detail after we deemed it not an option due to lack of audio interfaces

2016-12-07T17:08:13 <Bosmon5> Hi there Justin_o
2016-12-07T17:08:30 <Bosmon5> I left you some review comments on fluid-publish last week
2016-12-07T17:08:37 <gtirloni> amatas: that\'s for a VM, right?
2016-12-07T17:08:51 <amatas> gtirloni, to run virtualbox inside it
2016-12-07T17:08:54 <Bosmon5> And I did roll a dev release at that point
2016-12-07T17:09:00 <amatas> at least it support audio interface
2016-12-07T17:09:09 <gtirloni> we\'re not interested in the audio output (i.e. nobody needs to hear it), but the environment has to present a audio device that can be written to
2016-12-07T17:09:42 <gtirloni> so if, say, chrome headless can run inside a Xfvb and still present javascript with webaudio api, that\'d work for us I think
2016-12-07T17:09:48 <amatas> I think we can use xpra for that
2016-12-07T17:10:01 <gtirloni> i think my point is, VMs are too heavy
2016-12-07T17:10:44 <gtirloni> in which case, if a container can have a web browser + Xfvb + audio.. then that\'d be awesome
2016-12-07T17:11:14 <Justin_o> jhung: are you able to help with infusion package testing?
2016-12-07T17:11:59 <amatas> gtirloni, I think it\'s possible. At least I\'m running xpra + audio + some desktop applications in a headless server
2016-12-07T17:12:14 <gtirloni> but it\'s inside a VM, right?
2016-12-07T17:12:30 <amatas> it isn\'t, it\'s running on the bare metal
2016-12-07T17:12:35 <gtirloni> say we have a AWS VM, with docker, and we want to run a container with chrome + audio.. would that work?
2016-12-07T17:12:46 <amatas> I think so
2016-12-07T17:13:21 <jhung> Justin_o: I should be able to help. Maybe this afternoon or tomorrow.
2016-12-07T17:14:14 <Justin_o> jhung: okay, let me know if / when you are able to help
2016-12-07T17:14:20 <Justin_o> I\'ll just send you the package to test directly
2016-12-07T17:15:25 * michelled has quit
2016-12-07T17:15:36 <gtirloni> amatas: it\'s something we should explore for apps that don\'t need a full desktop environment (gnome3, etc).. it\'d benefit infusion (faster builds) but not GPII/windows or GPII/linux of course..
2016-12-07T17:16:20 <gtirloni> i think all of tony\'s apps would appreciate it too :)
2016-12-07T17:16:56 <gtirloni> amatas: i can open a JIRA to research that if you think that\'s doable
2016-12-07T17:17:55 <gtirloni> unless gloob has doubitos
2016-12-07T17:17:59 * gtirloni hides
2016-12-07T17:18:04 <gloob> gtirloni: you too?
2016-12-07T17:18:08 <gloob> gtirloni: seriously?
2016-12-07T17:18:13 <gtirloni> ;)
2016-12-07T17:18:35 <amatas> gtirloni, go ahead with the jira, I think that it\'s interesting. We can discuss that in the next ops meeting
2016-12-07T17:18:42 <gloob> so, there\'s another migration decision to make
2016-12-07T17:18:46 <gloob> containers
2016-12-07T17:19:29 <gloob> but that will kill the paradigm of test the same in dev, staging, pro etc, no?
2016-12-07T17:19:38 <amatas> I don\'t see it as a migration, is to use the roles that we have in a container. With only the addition of install xpra + the browsers needed

2016-12-07T17:21:06 * sgithens_ is now known as sgithens
2016-12-07T17:21:10 <gtirloni> xpra inside the container?
2016-12-07T17:21:32 <gloob> 18:10 < gtirloni> in which case, if a container can have a web browser + Xfvb + audio.. then that\'d be awesome
2016-12-07T17:21:54 * alanharnum joined the channel
2016-12-07T17:22:07 <gtirloni> gloob: i think that\'d be a solution only for simpler apps.. websites and microservices. for things like GPII, a screen reader, etc... we can\'t escape the requirement of a complete desktop environment (which means either full virtualization or bare metal)
2016-12-07T17:22:19 <gloob> ahh, got it
2016-12-07T17:23:35 <gtirloni> for infusion, we only need the browser environment.. so if that can run inside a container (it can) and make webaudio api available (which most projects don\'t seem to need because reasons).. that\'s more lightweight than a vbox VM eating resources away (and faster, which i think is more important)
2016-12-07T17:24:12 <gtirloni> amatas: cool, i\'ll open the jira
2016-12-07T17:24:29 <Justin_o> Bosmon5: sorry, missed your ping

2016-12-07T17:26:23 <the-t-in-rtf> @amatas, @gtirloni, @avtar, just to follow up on our chromedriver discussion, after wrestling with the paths for a bit, I ended up adding chromedriver as a dev dependency in other packages.
2016-12-07T17:26:43 <the-t-in-rtf> which puts it in the path that selenium-webdriver searches.
2016-12-07T17:26:53 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, the commands are now much simplier.
2016-12-07T17:27:12 <gtirloni> the-t-in-rtf: cool!
2016-12-07T17:27:37 <gtirloni> the-t-in-rtf: i\'m messing around with email notifications for aborted builds.. but it seems that, as experienced previously, the setting is completely ignored. still trying....
2016-12-07T17:27:48 <the-t-in-rtf> cool.
2016-12-07T17:28:10 <the-t-in-rtf> I am about to sign off for the day, will keep trying things during our overlap tomorrow.
2016-12-07T17:28:20 <the-t-in-rtf> So great to have nearly all the builds actually working again!
2016-12-07T17:29:56 <gtirloni> have a great evening.

2016-12-07T18:20:53 <colinclark> amatas, gtirloni: I believe ALSA has a "dummy" device
2016-12-07T18:21:10 <colinclark> which Chrome will use if it\'s available in a container environment
2016-12-07T18:21:34 <gloob> do you use alsa directory or through pulseaudio?
2016-12-07T18:21:42 <gloob> pulseaudio have a virtual sink for sure
2016-12-07T18:21:44 <colinclark> pulseaudio is the worst
2016-12-07T18:21:47 <gloob> yes
2016-12-07T18:21:51 <colinclark> I mean, I\'m not Linux expert
2016-12-07T18:21:53 <gloob> I fight with it
2016-12-07T18:21:56 <gloob> time to time
2016-12-07T18:21:59 <colinclark> yeah
2016-12-07T18:22:03 <gloob> the idea is good
2016-12-07T18:22:04 <gtirloni> ah "alsa" is the keyword. suddenly a sea of results opens up in google. thanks!
2016-12-07T18:22:07 <gloob> the implementation is weird
2016-12-07T18:22:10 <colinclark> Straight ALSA is just fine for Chrome, anyway
2016-12-07T18:22:28 <colinclark> I\'ve done sound installations that were Raspberry Pis running xfvb and ALSA
2016-12-07T18:22:33 <colinclark> I explicitly removed Pulse entirely
2016-12-07T18:22:47 <colinclark> obviously I actually wanted sound output
2016-12-07T18:22:57 <colinclark> but I don\'t see why ALSA\'s dummy or null device shouldn\'t work
2016-12-07T18:23:22 <gtirloni> anything we can get to trick chrome/firefox into thinking there\'s audio, works
2016-12-07T18:27:15 <colinclark> If I can help, I\'d be happy to, gtirloni
2016-12-07T18:27:44 <colinclark> I guess we might want a VNC server or something working with xvfb for debugging/troubleshooting in a containerized environment?
2016-12-07T18:28:56 <gtirloni> that\'d make sense

b'2016-12-07T16:36:26 <amatas> gloob, I guess that reaching the same amount of features in Gitlab ci as we have in Jenkins is a good starting point
2016-12-07T16:36:29 <gloob> avtar: it will help make questions from my side?
2016-12-07T16:36:29 <avtar> future work that would get gitlab ci to respond to pr comments for commands the way jenkins currently does
2016-12-07T16:36:58 <avtar> other than that i\'ll bring it up during the next arch meeting so if people want to add their +1s or -1s
2016-12-07T16:37:02 <gloob> I mean, I don\'t know but some doubts come to my mind
2016-12-07T16:37:05 <gloob> yeah
2016-12-07T16:37:14 <avtar> gloob: doubts are a good sign
2016-12-07T16:37:23 <avtar> blind faith is a bad sign
2016-12-07T16:37:42 <gloob> I\'m going to do a t-shirt with that
2016-12-07T16:38:30 <colinclark> I\'m always fascinated by this Spanish use of the term "doubts"
2016-12-07T16:38:30 <avtar> :)
2016-12-07T16:38:54 <colinclark> I\'ve always assumed that it means "questions" rather than "concerns"
2016-12-07T16:39:48 <amatas> colinclark, both meanings are fine for our understanding of the word, sorry for the confusion :D
2016-12-07T16:39:51 <gloob> a feeling of uncertainty or lack of conviction.
2016-12-07T16:40:15 <gloob> probably it is a false friend
2016-12-07T16:40:20 <gloob> dudas is the spanish word
2016-12-07T16:41:06 <gloob> that we use somehow for "a proposed question to be resolved"
2016-12-07T16:42:34 <gloob> so doubts are more questions than concerns?
2016-12-07T16:43:00 <colinclark> To answer the earlier questoin about "what do we need to get to yes," I think avtar hit the nail on the head
2016-12-07T16:43:15 <colinclark> we need a working prototype that allows us to see GitLab\'s viability
2016-12-07T16:43:18 <colinclark> (or lack thereof)
2016-12-07T16:43:21 <gloob> yes
2016-12-07T16:43:27 <colinclark> ultimately, gtirloni was being rather gentle about Jenkins
2016-12-07T16:43:27 <gloob> that was my first concern
2016-12-07T16:43:30 <gloob> don\'t go so far
2016-12-07T16:43:32 <colinclark> It\'s terrible
2016-12-07T16:43:33 <gloob> without MVP
2016-12-07T16:43:36 <colinclark> it\'s broken
2016-12-07T16:43:38 <gloob> look
2016-12-07T16:43:44 <gloob> I talk like a MBA guy
2016-12-07T16:43:51 <colinclark> these plugins we rely on, as the-t-in-rtf points out, are flat out unusable
2016-12-07T16:43:57 <colinclark> gloob: onboard it
2016-12-07T16:44:01 <colinclark> gloob: synergize
2016-12-07T16:44:21 <avtar> colinclark: the jenkins pr builder plugin is also unmaintained now :/
2016-12-07T16:44:28 <colinclark> it\'s the worst
2016-12-07T16:44:30 <colinclark> flat out
2016-12-07T16:44:42 <amatas> :(
2016-12-07T16:44:49 <gloob> a pro item for the pros and cons list
2016-12-07T16:44:54 * sgithens has quit
2016-12-07T16:44:55 <avtar> who will make ci great again?
2016-12-07T16:44:59 <amatas> haha
2016-12-07T16:45:06 <colinclark> regard "doubts"
2016-12-07T16:45:13 <gloob> don\'t ask to the citizenship
2016-12-07T16:45:24 <colinclark> usually when someone says, in English, "I have doubts," it suggests that they think something is wrong
2016-12-07T16:45:32 <colinclark> as opposed to having questions that are unresolved
2016-12-07T16:45:35 <gloob> so its concerns
2016-12-07T16:45:35 <colinclark> if the distinction is clear
2016-12-07T16:45:37 <colinclark> I think :)
2016-12-07T16:45:41 <colinclark> doubts is more like concerns, yes
2016-12-07T16:46:12 <gloob> but more "I think you are wrong with your proposition" than concern?
2016-12-07T16:46:27 <colinclark> it sort of suggests that, yes
2016-12-07T16:46:33 <colinclark> Not that I thought you were saying that
2016-12-07T16:46:33 <gloob> ok, thanks
2016-12-07T16:46:41 <colinclark> I remember years ago, first hearing this idiom
2016-12-07T16:46:48 <gloob> wow, a lot of evilness without taking notice
2016-12-07T16:46:52 <colinclark> I\'ve only noticed it among Spaniards
2016-12-07T16:46:54 <colinclark> no no
2016-12-07T16:46:56 <colinclark> I wasn\'t correcting you
2016-12-07T16:46:59 <colinclark> or suggesting evilness
2016-12-07T16:47:05 <gloob> no, I\'m
2016-12-07T16:47:06 <amatas> oh, I understood it the other way around
2016-12-07T16:47:06 <gloob> :D
2016-12-07T16:47:07 <colinclark> I was just trying to clarify if I was interpreting your use of the word right
2016-12-07T16:47:09 <colinclark> :)
2016-12-07T16:47:28 <gloob> yeah, but others english spoken people maybe are not so kind with me
2016-12-07T16:47:29 <gloob> :D
2016-12-07T16:47:31 * cindyli has quit
2016-12-07T16:47:46 <amatas> so I guess that is a false friend
2016-12-07T16:47:52 <gloob> yes
2016-12-07T16:48:01 <gloob> because doubts is more in the question side than concerns
2016-12-07T16:48:04 <gloob> in spanish
2016-12-07T16:48:10 <colinclark> right, that was my impression
2016-12-07T16:48:11 <gloob> as colinclark well explained
2016-12-07T16:48:17 <amatas> something that isn\'t enough clear
2016-12-07T16:48:33 <avtar> amatas, colinclark, gloob: tomato tomate
2016-12-07T16:48:34 * cindyli joined the channel
2016-12-07T16:48:41 <colinclark> Tomatocito!
2016-12-07T16:48:42 <gloob> we have a new meme
2016-12-07T16:48:43 <gloob> a pair
2016-12-07T16:48:47 <gloob> Que?
2016-12-07T16:48:48 <gloob> and
2016-12-07T16:48:54 <gloob> add -ito to everything
2016-12-07T16:49:11 <colinclark> well said, gloobito
2016-12-07T16:49:15 <avtar> lol
2016-12-07T16:49:19 <gloob> that
2016-12-07T16:49:31 * sgithens joined the channel
2016-12-07T16:49:35 <gloob> it\'s only funny for colinclark
2016-12-07T16:49:44 <colinclark> but it\'s VERY funny for colinclark
2016-12-07T16:49:56 <colinclark> Speaking of clarifying meanings...
2016-12-07T16:50:09 <colinclark> avtar: Talking about "GitLab" can sometimes confuse me
2016-12-07T16:50:13 <colinclark> because it\'s sort of two things, right?
2016-12-07T16:50:25 <colinclark> It\'s both a hosted development service a bit like Github
2016-12-07T16:50:35 <gloob> yes, that\'s was my question
2016-12-07T16:50:39 <colinclark> but it\'s also software you can install on a server somewhere
2016-12-07T16:50:42 <gloob> previous one
2016-12-07T16:50:43 <amatas> globito also means condom in spanish
2016-12-07T16:50:48 <colinclark> oh dear
2016-12-07T16:51:00 <colinclark> I\'ll go back to Alejandrito, then
2016-12-07T16:51:03 <gloob> and baloon
2016-12-07T16:51:07 <avtar> colinclark: yes, i try to refer to it as \'gitlab ci\'
2016-12-07T16:51:08 * clown joined the channel
2016-12-07T16:51:08 <amatas> hahaha
2016-12-07T16:51:14 <avtar> i\'ll stick with gloobito
2016-12-07T16:51:23 <gloob> avtar: maybe is more complete "hosted gitlab ci/cd"
2016-12-07T16:51:27 <gloob> ?
2016-12-07T16:51:35 <colinclark> avtar: And when you say that, you more mean "an instance of GithLab Community Edition installed on our servers?"
2016-12-07T16:51:40 <gloob> avtar: seriously, it is not funny :(
2016-12-07T16:51:47 <colinclark> no no
2016-12-07T16:51:52 <avtar> gloob: https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-ci/
2016-12-07T16:52:00 <avtar> those are the bits we\'re interested in
2016-12-07T16:52:02 <gloob> so gitla-ci
2016-12-07T16:52:13 <gloob> "hosted gitlab-ci"?
2016-12-07T16:52:18 <amatas> gloob, gitlab ci is written in Go lang ;)
2016-12-07T16:52:42 <gloob> hah\xc3\xa1
2016-12-07T16:52:45 <gloob> a plus one
2016-12-07T16:52:55 * alanharnum has quit
2016-12-07T16:53:19 <gloob> if we need to hack on it TELL ME
2016-12-07T16:53:39 <colinclark> also if it is coded in assembly language
2016-12-07T16:53:42 <colinclark> count gloob in!
2016-12-07T16:53:53 <gloob> my two passions, swapping bits and golang
2016-12-07T16:54:32 <avtar> colinclark: no, by \'gitlab ci\' i mean running their ci runner on any host (could be your laptop) that orchestrates ci jobs (in our case that\'s using vagrant automation) -- the ci runner then uses the gitlab api (this could be gitlab.com or gitlab ce self-hosted) to deliver job results
2016-12-07T16:54:45 <colinclark> ok
2016-12-07T16:54:49 <colinclark> fascinating
2016-12-07T16:55:07 <colinclark> So I have assumed that it was pretty likely that in the case of the GPII\'s CI system, we\'re talking about the latter case
2016-12-07T16:55:08 <avtar> so in a way we\'re moving jenkins to dev laptops...
2016-12-07T16:55:12 <colinclark> i.e. self-hosted Gitlab CE
2016-12-07T16:55:13 <gloob> ohhhhh
2016-12-07T16:55:32 <gloob> ah self-hosted great
2016-12-07T16:55:33 <avtar> colinclark: yes, for gpii we\'ll probably want to host an instance of gitlab ce
2016-12-07T16:55:51 <gloob> umhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
2016-12-07T16:56:08 <colinclark> whereas for a lot of P4A users, we\'ll probably suggest that they mirror their repository on the GitLab cloud service, in order to reduce the cost of support, right avtar ?
2016-12-07T16:56:09 <gloob> but there will be a main jenkins somehere in the internet executing prs?
2016-12-07T16:56:15 <colinclark> no
2016-12-07T16:56:24 <gloob> that\'s bad
2016-12-07T16:56:27 <colinclark> keine JENKINS
2016-12-07T16:56:34 <gloob> or good to have I guess
2016-12-07T16:56:44 <colinclark> is that correct, avtar?
2016-12-07T16:57:14 <avtar> colinclark: yes, most p4a users will be able to use the gitlab.com cloud service and not have to maintain their own infra
2016-12-07T16:57:29 <avtar> colinclark, gloob: no jenkins involved in this type of setup
2016-12-07T16:57:30 <gloob> at least from my experience, it helps to have another machine re-checking when I push to github, I guess that probably the-t-in-rtf used it a lot
2016-12-07T16:57:36 <colinclark> or they could, like, provisoin a raspberry pi to do it or something, right avtar?
2016-12-07T16:57:57 <avtar> a raspberry pi could be used for lightweight ci jobs
2016-12-07T16:57:59 <amatas> something to test in my brand new rpi3
2016-12-07T16:58:12 <avtar> something like virtualbox would be a tall order
2016-12-07T16:58:35 <colinclark> right
2016-12-07T16:58:40 <gloob> yes, whoever that has compiled ffmpeg in a rpi knows that
2016-12-07T16:58:42 <avtar> lightweight ci jobs would probably be container workloads
2016-12-07T16:58:48 <colinclark> right, exactly
2016-12-07T16:58:49 <gloob> without counting ram memory
2016-12-07T16:58:51 <colinclark> not for Windows-based apps and stuff

2016-12-07T14:24:07 <amatas> the-t-in-rtf, I remember that we talked about something similar. Because I believe that the tests use /tmp as temporal directory, and that directory only have a few gigs of free space
2016-12-07T14:24:30 <gtirloni> how many MBs are we talking about?
2016-12-07T14:24:58 <the-t-in-rtf> Let me see if I can find the old workaround, I optimistically took it out hoping to simplify things.
2016-12-07T14:25:06 <the-t-in-rtf> Can someone restart gpii-location-bar-relay?
2016-12-07T14:25:07 <gtirloni> i think /tmp is only used to copy the repo initially.. but if `vagrant provision` is executed multiple times, they it\'ll grow
2016-12-07T14:25:15 <amatas> gtirloni, Fedora, as many other distros, uses tmpfs filesystem for /tmp, so I guess that it has he remaining free ram
2016-12-07T14:25:16 <gtirloni> however, we are working with fresh VMs, right?
2016-12-07T14:26:06 * jhernandez joined the channel

2016-12-07T14:26:33 <jhernandez> avtar: looks like we\'re in gotomeeting, just in case you\'re interested
2016-12-07T14:26:40 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, is there a directory that does have more room?
2016-12-07T14:26:56 <the-t-in-rtf> I think I added this the last time we encountered the problem: https://github.com/the-t-in-rtf/gpii-pouchdb-lucene/blob/GPII-1785/.qi.yml#L21
2016-12-07T14:27:06 <amatas> the-t-in-rtf, /var/tmp can be used as well and it doesn\'t depend on the free ram
2016-12-07T14:27:13 <the-t-in-rtf> awesome, will update now.
2016-12-07T14:27:17 <the-t-in-rtf> thanks @amatas
2016-12-07T14:28:28 <gtirloni> amatas: i think we could safely change this https://github.com/idi-ops/ansible-nodejs/blob/d584e9947aa571eee7096f1d2d83918d90eb707d/vars/RedHat.yml#L29
2016-12-07T14:28:32 <gtirloni> amatas: what do you think?
2016-12-07T14:28:57 <gtirloni> iirc, that\'s the root cause
2016-12-07T14:33:27 <amatas> gtirloni, I\'m trying to match the solution (that line) with the problem :D. but I\'m not able to get it,maybe I need some coffee....

2016-12-07T14:37:57 <gtirloni> actually, i think *i* need some coffee too.. that was used by the workaround on windows but i guess it\'s not needed anymore. yeah, please ignore my suggestion
2016-12-07T14:39:28 * alanharnum has quit
2016-12-07T14:41:46 * cindyli has quit
2016-12-07T14:41:50 <amatas> gtirloni, ok, now I understand, but with your latest workaround at vagrant provision (which I have to integrate with the plugin) I think that that line is not needed.
2016-12-07T14:44:00 <gtirloni> yeah, agreed
2016-12-07T14:44:16 * gtirloni is injecting more coffee into the system
2016-12-07T14:44:43 <the-t-in-rtf> just remembering our DBA a few jobs ago
2016-12-07T14:44:53 <the-t-in-rtf> he kept a coffee pot at his desk and basically drank from the pot all day
2016-12-07T14:45:13 <the-t-in-rtf> he was showing us a printed diagram, my colleague had to take it out of the DBA\'s shaking hands so that we could read it.
2016-12-07T14:46:45 <gtirloni> yeah, that\'s pretty extreme. at some point the neuro-whatever are all flooded and it doesn\'t help anymore. i usually take coffee once in the morning and in the afternoon (before 4pm if possible)
2016-12-07T14:47:19 <gtirloni> (it\'s 12:47pm here)
2016-12-07T14:47:21 <gloob> I remember a few days with that effect

2016-12-07T14:52:57 <the-t-in-rtf> and since then I try not to overdo it, so that it helps when I really need it.

2016-12-07T15:07:27 <the-t-in-rtf> OK, a lot of builds like gpii-json-schema are failing because of the lack of chromedriver.  The commands to install it work locally, but fail in QI.
2016-12-07T15:08:27 <the-t-in-rtf> gpii-webdriver looked like it was passing, but only because it failed in a way that resulted in no tests running.
2016-12-07T15:08:48 <the-t-in-rtf> http://i-0044.tor1.inclusivedesign.ca/job/gpii-webdriver-commands/9/console
2016-12-07T15:09:37 <the-t-in-rtf> This message is quite disturbing: "==> fedora: VM is not currently running. Please, first bring it up with `vagrant up` then run this command.
2016-12-07T15:09:38 <the-t-in-rtf> "
2016-12-07T15:09:44 <the-t-in-rtf> That should result in a failure, IMO
2016-12-07T15:09:45 * danayo joined the channel
2016-12-07T15:10:01 <the-t-in-rtf> it should not be possible for that failed step to give the appearance of passing
2016-12-07T15:12:45 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, I updated the config for that package, the tests now pass.
2016-12-07T15:12:56 <the-t-in-rtf> which suggests that the fix I use there will work for other things that use gpii-webdriver
2016-12-07T15:12:59 <the-t-in-rtf> I\'ll try that now
2016-12-07T15:15:52 <amatas> cool
2016-12-07T15:17:56 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, @avtar, gpii-webdriver gpii-json-schema, gpii-handlebars, and gpii-location-bar-relay all demonstrate what you need to run tests with gpii-webdriver, namely adding the chromedriver included with the repo to your path.
2016-12-07T15:18:15 <the-t-in-rtf> previously that wasn\'t necessary as they bundled a firefox driver and we only used firefox in QI

2016-12-07T15:21:00 <amatas> the-t-in-rtf, that message about the VM is not running is got when the creation of the VM failed, because it doesn\'t exist.
2016-12-07T15:21:19 <the-t-in-rtf> yes, and that should absolutely result in the build failing.
2016-12-07T15:21:53 <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. Jenkins merrily displayed a blue ball afterwards

2016-12-07T15:23:22 <the-t-in-rtf> you\'re welcome, although I\'ll feel better about it once I get a range of browsers working seamlessly
2016-12-07T15:23:41 <amatas> the-t-in-rtf, I believe that the lines https://github.com/the-t-in-rtf/gpii-webdriver/blob/GPII-1913/.qi.yml#L22-L23 are no longer required since this patch in the base VMs: https://github.com/idi-ops/packer-fedora/commit/c84f4647f142a115de57b45971c01133d64bf86a
2016-12-07T15:23:41 <the-t-in-rtf> hopefully all the browser manufacturers will catch up soon enough.
2016-12-07T15:23:59 <the-t-in-rtf> awesome, thanks @amatas, I will try taking that out.
2016-12-07T15:24:14 <avtar> amatas, the-t-in-rtf: if the create vm job fails then the multijob plugin will grind everything to a halt and the delete vm job won\'t be run
2016-12-07T15:24:27 <avtar> which will leave vms lingering
2016-12-07T15:24:53 <avtar> it sucks but it\'s a shortcoming of the plugin in question
2016-12-07T15:25:20 <the-t-in-rtf> that\'s terrible.
2016-12-07T15:25:24 <avtar> yes
2016-12-07T15:25:44 <gtirloni> amatas avtar: with the vagrnt plugin, would the vm destruction be done by it.. or the gitlab runner?
2016-12-07T15:25:48 <amatas> also, I\'m afraid that the line https://github.com/the-t-in-rtf/gpii-webdriver/blob/GPII-1913/.qi.yml#L21 won\'t be applied in the command #24 because each line are executed in different shells. I\'d change the line 24 by: PATH=$PATH:/home/vagrant/sync/node_modules/chromedriver/bin/chromedriver/ BROWSERS=chrome yarn test
2016-12-07T15:26:10 <gtirloni> amatas avtar: i remember we discussed mandatory steps to be inherited by all jobs, but i don\'t remember how
2016-12-07T15:26:30 <avtar> people use(d) those types of plugins when jenkins didn\'t have pipelines, but jenkins\' pipelines plugins weren\'t predictable in their behaviour when gtirloni and i were evaluating this feature
2016-12-07T15:27:10 <amatas> gtirloni, the vagrant plugin are a couple of hooks in the setup of the environment (previous of any command) so, the up/destroy/halt will have the same behavior as usual
2016-12-07T15:27:20 <gtirloni> right, they only cover the most common/basic scenarios and had a lot of corner cases (which we seem to have encountered them all)
2016-12-07T15:27:31 <amatas> I mean, to destroy the VM you will need a "vagrant destroy" command
2016-12-07T15:27:56 <gtirloni> amatas: i mean when tests run.. what ensures the VM is destroyed if, say, the-t-in-rtf, doesn\'t have `vagrant destroy` in the .qi.yml
2016-12-07T15:28:31 <amatas> as far as I know the "vagrant destroy" is performed by a step in the gitlab-ci
2016-12-07T15:28:47 <amatas> it isn\'t needed in the .qi.yml file
2016-12-07T15:28:57 <gtirloni> ok
2016-12-07T15:28:59 <avtar> gtirloni: https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/ci/yaml/#after_script

2016-12-07T15:29:18 <gtirloni> oh ok, cool
2016-12-07T15:29:27 <avtar> something like that causes the vm to be removed regardless of failures like the one the-t-in-rtf mentioned earlier
2016-12-07T15:29:44 <avtar> brb
2016-12-07T15:31:08 <amatas> the-t-in-rtf, I\'m not familiar with the chrome webdriver, can it be installed with npm or yarn?
2016-12-07T15:31:56 <the-t-in-rtf> yes
2016-12-07T15:32:06 <the-t-in-rtf> and in fact all my packages that use gpii-webdriver do so.
2016-12-07T15:32:14 * colinclark joined the channel
2016-12-07T15:32:14 <the-t-in-rtf> just check the package.json for gpii-webdriver, for example
2016-12-07T15:32:31 * michelled joined the channel
2016-12-07T15:33:04 <the-t-in-rtf> I think in the npm3/yarn world I might be able to avoid adding it as a dev dependency in upstream packages as long as I made it a non-dev dependency in gpii-webdriver
2016-12-07T15:33:43 * jhernandez joined the channel
2016-12-07T15:36:04 <amatas> the-t-in-rtf, and wath do you think about add a line to the setup list like "yarn install -g chromedriver" and remove the PATH variable of the last line?
2016-12-07T15:37:13 <the-t-in-rtf> I generally despise global install steps
2016-12-07T15:37:23 <the-t-in-rtf> if it\'s possible to install a thing in the repo, that is
2016-12-07T15:37:42 <the-t-in-rtf> and it\'s "yarn add global chromedriver"
2016-12-07T15:38:05 <the-t-in-rtf> the problem isn\'t when running in QI, it\'s when running locally.
2016-12-07T15:38:19 <the-t-in-rtf> relying on global installs makes it very very easy for one dev to not see a problem that an other dev does.
2016-12-07T15:38:23 <amatas> ok, understood
2016-12-07T15:38:34 <the-t-in-rtf> as I\'m not going to be reinstalling the package globally every time I run the tests.
2016-12-07T15:39:32 <the-t-in-rtf> once we end up with multiple browsers, I will probably have to do so, though
2016-12-07T15:39:49 <the-t-in-rtf> otherwise I\'ll have a really messy path with 2 extra entries.
2016-12-07T15:40:07 <the-t-in-rtf> IMO there should be some kind of option to set the path for the whole run
2016-12-07T15:40:10 <the-t-in-rtf> and/or a variable.
2016-12-07T15:40:54 <the-t-in-rtf> it\'s the kind of thing that\'s likely to keep coming up

2016-12-07T15:44:17 <Justin_o> Bosmon: could you do me a favour. I\'m getting ready to test the Infusion packages, for the infusion 2.0 release. now that we have an npm module, i figure we can push up a dev build for what\'s in master now and add that to our testing. Could you create a dev release, and while you\'re at it, look at my PR for fluid-publish?

2016-12-07T15:59:32 <the-t-in-rtf> OK, QI team, here\'s a case of a timeout not being reported as a build failure: http://i-0044.tor1.inclusivedesign.ca/job/gpii-location-bar-relay-commands/10/console
2016-12-07T16:00:44 <amatas> the-t-in-rtf, how much time do those tests take?
2016-12-07T16:05:05 <the-t-in-rtf> well, the timeout took 36 minutes
2016-12-07T16:05:16 <the-t-in-rtf> but this is another case where a clear failure is presented as a success
2016-12-07T16:06:01 <the-t-in-rtf> plugin or no, you\'re going to have to deal with failing to complete successfully after N minutes as a kind of failure somehow.
2016-12-07T16:06:33 <the-t-in-rtf> We now have two problems that require me to review each run of each test to confirm success.
2016-12-07T16:06:37 <the-t-in-rtf> that\'s a problem.
2016-12-07T16:10:42 <gtirloni> that\'s an issue we have had with jenkins for a long time. aborted builds don\'t show up as a failure with the multijob plugin... it\'s another issue that should be gone once we migrated to GitLab. There are workarounds in the former of more plugins, but in our experience they have caused more problems
2016-12-07T16:10:58 <gtirloni> in summary, when a build reaches the timeout, Jenkins aborts it and doesn\'t register it as a failure
2016-12-07T16:11:31 <gtirloni> I\'ll check if the situation with the plugins has improved and there is a flag to change this behavior
2016-12-07T16:12:24 <gtirloni> hopefully, it\'s not updating GitHub with a success flag
2016-12-07T16:17:50 * colinclark joined the channel
2016-12-07T16:21:12 <gloob> gtirloni: the migration to gitlab decision is made?
2016-12-07T16:21:45 <the-t-in-rtf> If any help is needed convincing someone, I am happy to give a testimonial.
2016-12-07T16:22:47 <gtirloni> i don\'t think we have a final decision, it\'s seems doable and avtar has done some work in that front
2016-12-07T16:23:53 <gtirloni> i will speak for myself only, i don\'t see the jenkins ecosystem getting any better (based on past experiences that started more than a year ago). so i\'m very hopeful we can make the transition
2016-12-07T16:24:00 <avtar> gloob: no official decision at this point https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2133
2016-12-07T16:24:48 <avtar> but my experience mirrors gtirloni\'s
2016-12-07T16:25:34 <avtar> i don\'t see jenkins becoming any easier to support going forward given what we know so far and upcoming apcp requirements
2016-12-07T16:29:44 <gloob> avtar\'s readmes are pure sugar
2016-12-07T16:30:20 <avtar> eat them up, gloob
2016-12-07T16:30:35 <gloob> hihi
2016-12-07T16:31:25 <the-t-in-rtf> OK, I commented on the ticket with an impassioned plea in support of your gitlab efforts
2016-12-07T16:31:32 <gloob> this is stevia https://github.com/avtar/push-ref-gitlab but this is full sugar https://github.com/avtar/docker-push-ref-gitlab
2016-12-07T16:31:57 <avtar> yeah, not too proud of the stevia one
2016-12-07T16:31:59 <gloob> so, I replied my own question reading it, but for extra assurance, I understand that we maintain our gitlab ci/cd infrastructure
2016-12-07T16:32:11 <gloob> in the same way we use jenkins
2016-12-07T16:32:53 <avtar> gloob: yes, so far i can say if we want to use gitlab ci the way we did jenkins for gpii (prior to building for each pr) then that\'s doable right now
2016-12-07T16:34:19 * clown has quit
2016-12-07T16:34:21 <gloob> hack into gitlab ci/cd stuff seems more sexy than jenkins to me, I\'m wondering what we need to turn into a yes and work on it?
2016-12-07T16:36:07 <avtar> gloob: i\'ll add more notes to GPII-2133 capturing my thoughts about what future work could look like

2016-12-07T10:33:18 <the-t-in-rtf> @amatas, is there a good example of a failing build?  I\'d rather try/fix one than try all of them.
2016-12-07T10:34:46 <the-t-in-rtf> I can already tell you that gpii-handlebars and gpii-pouchdb-lucene work on my machine.
2016-12-07T10:45:11 <the-t-in-rtf> @amatas, I just fixed a typo in a .qi.yml file, and I\'m getting really disturbing vagrant failures: http://i-0044.tor1.inclusivedesign.ca/job/gpii-binder-commands/38/console
2016-12-07T10:49:41 <the-t-in-rtf> There are problems running that build locally (I\'m working on it), but no complaints about vagrant plugins.
2016-12-07T10:54:39 <the-t-in-rtf> OK, the build passes locally but fails on QI, same plugin error.
2016-12-07T10:55:02 <the-t-in-rtf> As I can\'t do anything about that, I will hold off on further QI work until I hear back from one of you.
2016-12-07T10:55:29 <the-t-in-rtf> gpii-binder now passes locally, so you have three that should work.

2016-12-07T13:38:49 <the-t-in-rtf> @amatas, Sinterklaas is based on a historical figure who was a bishop in Turkey, but yes, they think he sails from Spain.
2016-12-07T13:39:25 <the-t-in-rtf> not sure when he sails back, but they had the parade for his arrival in late November.
2016-12-07T13:39:47 <the-t-in-rtf> it\'s kind of a quantum thing, he simultaneously has a parade by a land route, and one by a water route, in the same city.
2016-12-07T13:39:59 <the-t-in-rtf> it might be possible to observe him in both states from the right spot.
2016-12-07T13:40:47 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, I will look into the handlebars build.
2016-12-07T13:41:33 <the-t-in-rtf> if there is a problem with chromedriver, then lots of builds will have the same problem.
2016-12-07T13:41:57 <the-t-in-rtf> however, gpii-mail-test and gpii-pouchdb-lucene should not be affected, and are still broken.  Can you refresh those?

2016-12-07T13:44:05 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, it\'s unclear, wikipedia seems to think that people got the idea he came from Spain because he would give out oranges.
2016-12-07T13:46:10 <the-t-in-rtf> This is my favorite part: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinterklaas#History
2016-12-07T13:46:28 <the-t-in-rtf> I like to call him "Father Odin"
2016-12-07T13:51:17 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, last point on Sint, if you want a really twisted take on the story, watch this movie:  http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1167675/
2016-12-07T13:55:38 <gtirloni> looks like Santa never runs out of weirdness.. I watched this movie a few years ago: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1401143/

2016-12-07T14:08:06 <the-t-in-rtf> OK, gpii-handlebars fails similarly locally, I can work on that.  If someone can kick over gpii-mail-test and gpii-pouchdb-lucene, that\'d be nice.

2016-12-07T14:13:54 <amatas> I left the *db* projects at the end because I saw that they failed because a lack of free space in the VM.

2016-12-07T14:15:36 <amatas> ok
2016-12-07T14:15:40 <jhernandez> avtar: if I were you, I wouldn\'t be interested on it
2016-12-07T14:15:42 <jhernandez> :P

2016-12-07T14:20:18 <the-t-in-rtf> Yes, @amatas, I see the same problem with gpii-pouchdb-lucene
2016-12-07T14:20:34 <the-t-in-rtf> (disk space)
2016-12-07T14:20:43 <the-t-in-rtf> is someone working on that?   Is there a ticket?
