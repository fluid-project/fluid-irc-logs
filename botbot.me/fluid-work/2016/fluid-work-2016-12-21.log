2016-12-21T20:20:43 <gtirloni> this is what the linux foundation / container foundation uses for CLA signing (i think): https://www.hellosign.com
2016-12-21T20:20:49 <gtirloni> Justin_o: ^
2016-12-21T20:24:24 <gtirloni> i think they might be using hellosign's API to implement things like this (a robot updating PR's that the CLA from that person was signed): https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/39099#event-902098845

2016-12-21T13:25:43 <gloob> gtirloni: that\'s similar to flatpak right?
2016-12-21T13:27:19 <gloob> gtirloni: it seems the osx approach (application multi-arch packaging) is gaining momentum in the linux side, flatpak, appimage and snaps
2016-12-21T13:27:38 <gloob> gtirloni: in fact, I remember to find an interesting project, let me check
2016-12-21T13:28:31 <gloob> http://snapcraft.io/
2016-12-21T13:28:43 <gloob> ah no, that is snaps from ubuntu
2016-12-21T13:29:41 <gtirloni> very interesting, i didn\'t know any of these existed until today. thanks!
2016-12-21T13:30:02 <gloob> gtirloni: Javi told me about https://github.com/endlessm/flatpak-bundler as idea to pack all gpii
2016-12-21T13:32:23 <gloob> gtirloni: and the interesting part https://github.com/projectatomic/bubblewrap/tree/59f8947054ba9d77f6f76c7c4316384870357e3d
2016-12-21T13:32:58 <gloob> gtirloni: and match with our kubernetes desire ;)
2016-12-21T13:36:13 <gtirloni> i like!
2016-12-21T13:50:14 <gloob> gtirloni: and finally, I think this is a similar approach to atomic https://hypercontainer.io/
2016-12-21T13:52:28 <gtirloni> that\'d be nice to really isolate apps
2016-12-21T13:52:56 <gtirloni> i like what atomic is doing with nulecule specification, it might be useful to us

2016-12-21T15:34:38 <Justin_o> gtirloni, alanharnum: i\'m having a problem running the fluidproject.org site locally on my machine. I\'m trying to do some dev work on it, but the icons aren\'t showing up at all
2016-12-21T15:34:50 <Justin_o> i\'m getting a CORS error in chrome for the fonts.
2016-12-21T15:34:56 <Justin_o> any ideas why this might be happening
2016-12-21T15:35:01 <Justin_o> and what I might do to fix this
2016-12-21T15:35:01 <alanharnum> Justin_o: let me clone it and have a look
2016-12-21T15:35:18 <Justin_o> it seems strange because it\'s working on the site, and jhung hasn\'t been able to reproduce it on his machine
2016-12-21T15:38:31 <alanharnum> Justin_o: which browser are you using?
2016-12-21T15:38:46 <Justin_o> I tried in Chrome and Firefox
2016-12-21T15:38:51 <Justin_o> are they working for you?
2016-12-21T15:47:29 * colinclark joined the channel
2016-12-21T15:50:07 <gtirloni> Justin_o: the server doesn\'t start here (there\'s nothing listening on port 9778 locally). plus, the URL seems to be set to "main" instead of "localhost"..
2016-12-21T15:50:19 <simonjb> colinclark: I shared my nexus science lab parts list with you on Google sheets
2016-12-21T15:50:30 <colinclark> awesome, simonjb
2016-12-21T15:50:32 <colinclark> i\'ll take a look
2016-12-21T15:50:40 <gtirloni> Justin_o: docpad 6.79.0, node 6.9.2
2016-12-21T15:50:51 <colinclark> this\'ll be the best science ever
2016-12-21T15:51:00 <alanharnum> for those wondering about Justin_o\'s issue, it turned out to be a CORS error when accessing the site locally via 127.0.0.1:9778 when docpad.coffee had docpadConfig.templateData.site.url set to localhost:9778
2016-12-21T15:51:04 <simonjb> I didn\'t include a case for the pi, not sure if we need one
2016-12-21T15:51:14 <alanharnum> CORS considers those to be cross-domain requests & blocks them
2016-12-21T15:51:27 <alanharnum> I\'ll do a PR against the README to shout about this in bigger letters
2016-12-21T15:52:51 <simonjb> colinclark: I sourced everything from buyapi -- you have had good experience with them?
2016-12-21T15:52:54 <gtirloni> alanharnum: here it\'s set to localhost but it\'s trying to use my machine\'s hostname
2016-12-21T15:53:01 <colinclark> They seemed fine enough
2016-12-21T15:53:08 <simonjb> ok, good
2016-12-21T15:53:09 <colinclark> shipping is, relatively speaking, expensive
2016-12-21T15:53:18 <colinclark> but they shipped their stuff and it was always the stuff I ordered
2016-12-21T15:53:25 <simonjb> they don\'t have the offical case and I\'m not sure if we need one
2016-12-21T15:53:43 <simonjb> any case would need to have the HAT exposed I think
2016-12-21T15:53:51 <colinclark> I was just going to say...
2016-12-21T15:54:16 <simonjb> maybe something like the pimoroni coupe
2016-12-21T15:54:36 <colinclark> Do we only need one Pi?
2016-12-21T15:54:40 <gtirloni> alanharnum Justin_o please ignore the issue i\'m having, it\'s listening on my network interface instead of localhost.. probably a linux issue.
2016-12-21T15:54:49 <alanharnum> liiiiiiinux!
2016-12-21T15:55:07 <simonjb> colinclark: it would be good to have 2, I think
2016-12-21T15:55:21 * michelled joined the channel
2016-12-21T15:55:28 <colinclark> ok
2016-12-21T15:55:35 <simonjb> colinclark: nice, I was just going to add quantity :)
2016-12-21T15:55:46 <colinclark> ha sorry
2016-12-21T15:55:57 <colinclark> you can do the formula :)
2016-12-21T15:57:05 <simonjb> done :)
2016-12-21T15:58:21 <simonjb> colinclark: do we want 2 sense hats?
2016-12-21T15:58:39 <colinclark> if you think it\'s good to have redundancy, yes
2016-12-21T15:59:09 <simonjb> it does depend on exactly what we want to demo
2016-12-21T15:59:36 <simonjb> 2 would be good to do comparison
2016-12-21T16:02:33 <simonjb> colinclark: I put 2 sense hats -- I\'m not sure we will need both but I think it\'s good to have a 2nd on hand in case
2016-12-21T16:03:37 <colinclark> yup me too
2016-12-21T16:04:48 <simonjb> as the demo develops we might want to add some other pieces but I think those are good core parts to start with
2016-12-21T16:05:16 <simonjb> I\'m looking forward to trying out the pH sensor
