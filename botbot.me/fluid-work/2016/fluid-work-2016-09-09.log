2016-09-09T19:36:07 <avtar> fluid-everyone: if anyone is interested in trying out infusion tests using browsers hosted by saucelabs then please check out https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5953
2016-09-09T19:36:40 <avtar> i\'m hoping we can spend some time looking at these issues during next wednesday\'s community meeting
2016-09-09T19:37:23 <avtar> but it\'ll help save time if people have run the tests themselves before the meeting

2016-09-09T19:52:22 <Bosmon> Hi there avtar
2016-09-09T19:52:25 <Bosmon> Thanks for the report
2016-09-09T19:52:28 <avtar> hey Bosmon
2016-09-09T19:52:38 <Bosmon> My feeling that what is happening is that the test files are not being served to the browser over HTTP
2016-09-09T19:52:51 <Bosmon> Hmm
2016-09-09T19:52:54 <Bosmon> I guess this isn\'t right
2016-09-09T19:53:03 <Bosmon> I see proper URLs in the stack frames
2016-09-09T19:54:03 <Bosmon> The Firefox test failure doesn\'t make any sense
2016-09-09T19:54:17 <Bosmon> Since the failure that is reported doesn\'t actually come from the test fixture which is being executed
2016-09-09T19:54:44 <avtar> i was showing justin yesterday that unfortunately you can\'t reliably reproduce the firefox failure on every run
2016-09-09T19:55:03 <Bosmon> Somehow it seems that there is not proper isolation between the test fixtures
2016-09-09T19:55:12 <Bosmon> Is it possible that the test runner is trying to run them concurrently somehow?
2016-09-09T19:55:51 <Bosmon> The test failure is actually from the previous fixture
2016-09-09T19:55:56 <Bosmon> Renderer-test.html
2016-09-09T19:56:05 <avtar> that\'s interesting then
2016-09-09T19:56:12 <Bosmon> But somehow is being reported as a failure for FluidIoC-test.html
2016-09-09T19:56:29 <Bosmon> Which I guess is not surprising if somehow the test is being killed off by the runner before it actually completes
2016-09-09T19:57:29 <avtar> Bosmon: there\'s also this firefox test failure that justin and gtirloni were discussing yesterday https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5952
2016-09-09T19:57:33 <alanharnum> Bosmon avtar: I saw that happen previously (test failure is actually from the previous fixture) with the text to speech tests when running all-tests due to jqunit not waiting for an async callback that would execute a test before moving on to the next test group
2016-09-09T19:57:46 <alanharnum> let me find the conversation it was discussed in
2016-09-09T19:57:53 <avtar> that also gets reported by firefox provided by sauce labs, but again, not on every run
2016-09-09T19:58:13 <Bosmon> avtar - the safari failure is actually similar
2016-09-09T19:58:31 <Bosmon> This is also a failure from Renderer-test.html which is falsely reported in FluidIoC-test.html
2016-09-09T19:58:55 <Bosmon> So I\'ve only seen these failures before when there is some kind of same origin policy failure that prevents an AJAX call from succeeding
2016-09-09T19:59:07 <alanharnum> Bosmon avtar: convo here: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/732#issuecomment-239905855
2016-09-09T20:00:23 <Bosmon> The renderer tests will issue AJAX calls for both HTML and JSON files
2016-09-09T20:00:44 <avtar> Bosmon: after seeing the sauce labs failures i also tried serving an infusion git working directory using python\'s http server and used firefox 48 running on my win10 host
2016-09-09T20:01:10 <Bosmon> It\'s a shame that the stack traces are so completely hosed in this trace
2016-09-09T20:01:16 <Bosmon> But I think it\'s pretty clear which test is failing
2016-09-09T20:02:14 <Bosmon> avtar - I assume you couldn\'t reproduce the failure
2016-09-09T20:02:33 <avtar> Bosmon: i could
2016-09-09T20:02:36 <avtar> but not on every run
2016-09-09T20:02:40 <Bosmon> !
2016-09-09T20:03:06 <avtar> which is the more frustrating part :P
2016-09-09T20:03:23 <gtirloni> same for FLUID-5952.. 2 out of 10 most of the time.
2016-09-09T20:03:56 <alanharnum> that sounds a lot like the variable failures we\'ve seen in other circumstances when tests are using AJAX to load fixture resources
2016-09-09T20:04:30 <alanharnum> which I believe may be connected to a similar issue to the one i linked above
2016-09-09T20:05:04 <avtar> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/732/commits/5ca02a86e3d6b8520f0e4623726cea0d68c57743
2016-09-09T20:05:05 <alanharnum> which is the all-tests fixture runner not waiting for an AJAX callback or other asynchronous action before moving on to the next test fixture
2016-09-09T20:05:07 <avtar> alanharnum: thanks for that
2016-09-09T20:05:52 <Bosmon> I\'ve just run it 5 times in a row on FF 48 on my Windows machine without failure
2016-09-09T20:06:01 <Bosmon> It would help if someone could get a proper stack trace from the failure
2016-09-09T20:06:09 <Bosmon> But I think I can make a reasonable guess about what it is
2016-09-09T20:06:48 * bens__ has quit
2016-09-09T20:08:12 <avtar> Bosmon: i\'ll give it a shot
2016-09-09T20:08:14 <avtar> one sec
2016-09-09T20:08:22 <Bosmon> Thanks, avtar
2016-09-09T20:08:29 <Bosmon> There is some real laziness in this test here: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/tests/framework-tests/renderer/js/RendererTests.js#L1509
2016-09-09T20:08:53 <Bosmon> As we now know, we have something like a 13ms window in which to finish queueing tests after the initial file load for a jqUnit sequence is complete
2016-09-09T20:09:08 <Bosmon> This is due to the code with great bogosity inside QUnit
2016-09-09T20:09:22 <Bosmon> So my guess is that sometimes we make this window and sometimes we don\'t
2016-09-09T20:09:35 <Bosmon> And that we\'re more likely to miss it on VMs or other machines with slow I/O
2016-09-09T20:10:07 <Bosmon> Thanks so much for the Infusion pull, simonjb :)
2016-09-09T20:10:37 <simonjb> you\'re welcome Bosmon :)

2016-09-09T20:32:43 <simonjb> Bosmon: I just saw that we have fluid.model.composeSegments() (I missed it before) -- I should probably use that rather than doing the join(".") to convert segs to string? Or is there a better way?
2016-09-09T20:40:52 <Bosmon> simonjb - you should, if you need to
2016-09-09T20:40:58 * alanharn_ is now known as alanharnum
2016-09-09T20:41:01 <Bosmon> But it\'s best to avoid composing a string at all
2016-09-09T20:41:12 <Bosmon> Oh, this is in componentForPath
2016-09-09T20:41:16 <Bosmon> It doesn\'t matter in that context
2016-09-09T20:41:22 * jhung joined the channel
2016-09-09T20:41:24 <Bosmon> Since periods in component members names are prohibited
2016-09-09T20:41:59 <simonjb> ok, thanks -- so it\'s reasonable to just leave as is with the join(".") ?
2016-09-09T20:42:29 <avtar> Bosmon: still trying here
2016-09-09T20:42:41 <avtar> i could only get it to fail once so far https://gist.githubusercontent.com/anonymous/e27b2298712ac8f6462e7fd105823fe5/raw/fdd75309aefbf0b2490e2f77fef5cbd73fed7d42/gistfile1.txt
2016-09-09T20:42:51 <Bosmon> simonjb yes, that\'s fine
2016-09-09T20:42:57 <avtar> but i\'m trying to obtain more info
2016-09-09T20:43:23 <Bosmon> avtar - still no useful stack trace
2016-09-09T20:43:37 <Bosmon> I guess it is swallowed into window.onError
2016-09-09T20:43:44 <Bosmon> I guess the browser doesn\'t have a console that you can view?
2016-09-09T20:44:36 <avtar> i\'m trying it locally so that that\'s easier to accomplish
2016-09-09T20:45:18 <Bosmon> ok great
2016-09-09T20:45:21 <cindyli> Bosmon: is it possible to use kettle for in browser things such as testing?
2016-09-09T20:45:33 <Bosmon> cindyli - it is not possible
2016-09-09T20:45:33 * jhung has quit
2016-09-09T20:45:35 <cindyli> seems very hard
2016-09-09T20:45:37 <Bosmon> Since it binds to node.js primitives
2016-09-09T20:45:41 <cindyli> ok
2016-09-09T20:45:43 <Bosmon> What would you like to use it for?
2016-09-09T20:45:54 <Bosmon> We can write variants of its test fixture classes that work in the browser
2016-09-09T20:46:01 <Bosmon> That bind to $.ajax instead
2016-09-09T20:47:30 <cindyli> Bosmon: i\'m trying to get the new data store for pouch/couch to be able to used in the browser. It\'s the base to fix all other in browser tests for the auth server. the new data store is based off these grades: https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/GPII-1821/gpii/node_modules/gpii-oauth2/gpii-oauth2-datastore/src/DbDataStore.js#L23
2016-09-09T20:47:46 <cindyli> very fundamental thing
2016-09-09T20:47:53 <cindyli> unless i can override these grades
2016-09-09T20:48:05 <cindyli> but it will affect the whole workflow
2016-09-09T20:48:28 <cindyli> suggestions, Bosmon?
2016-09-09T20:48:46 <Bosmon> cindyli - yes, you could make refactored versions of these grades
2016-09-09T20:48:55 <Bosmon> There might be a library to help you
2016-09-09T20:49:32 <Bosmon> cindyli - for example, this one: https://github.com/substack/http-browserify
2016-09-09T20:51:21 <cindyli> Bosmon: do i understand it correctly that the goal of using libraries like this is to be able to use kettle in browsers?
2016-09-09T20:51:59 <Bosmon> cindyli - this wouldn\'t allow you to use much of Kettle
2016-09-09T20:52:04 <cindyli> or do you mean I define a customized "kettle.dataSource.URL" that uses this library
2016-09-09T20:52:06 <Bosmon> But it would let you use the HTTP testing fixtures that you want to use now
2016-09-09T20:52:23 <Bosmon> Oh yes, and kettle.dataSource.URL
2016-09-09T20:52:32 <Bosmon> All you would need to do is "fudge the requires" somehow
2016-09-09T20:53:36 <cindyli> i\'ve fudged all the requires in my js files but struggling with ones from libraries as kettle
2016-09-09T20:54:40 <cindyli> Bosmon: so i need to redefine these components: "kettle.dataSource.URL", "kettle.dataSource.CouchDB"
2016-09-09T20:54:48 <cindyli> does that make sense tho?
2016-09-09T20:55:04 <Bosmon> cindyli - no
2016-09-09T20:55:11 <cindyli> lol
2016-09-09T20:55:27 <Bosmon> The point of this library is that is masquerades as the node HTTP API that these grades depend on
2016-09-09T20:55:39 <Bosmon> is -> it
2016-09-09T20:55:59 <cindyli> right
2016-09-09T20:56:16 <cindyli> but it doesn\'t help to get around the usage of "kettle.dataSource.URL", "kettle.dataSource.CouchDB"
2016-09-09T20:58:34 * alanharnum has quit
2016-09-09T20:59:16 <cindyli> Bosmon: i\'m thinking maybe i should simply convert in browser testing to server side testing with nodejs, which seems making more sense in this case. what do you think?
2016-09-09T21:00:29 <Bosmon> cindyli - well, perhaps - but isn\'t the point of the testing to test the browser pouch implementation?
2016-09-09T21:00:43 <Bosmon> cindyli - the users would continue to use kettle.dataSource.URL and kettle.dataSource.CouchDB
2016-09-09T21:03:27 <cindyli> Bosmon: i must miss something here. still don\'t know how to get around the usage of "kettle.dataSource.URL", "kettle.dataSource.CouchDB" grades for in browser testing

2016-09-09T21:04:54 <Bosmon> cindyli - yes, we would need to fudge kettle\'s requires somehow
2016-09-09T21:05:00 <Bosmon> Which we might just do via browserify itself
2016-09-09T21:05:12 <Bosmon> It\'s what its designed for after all : P

2016-09-09T21:10:17 <cindyli> seems this library is able to deal with all kinds of requires. powerful. thanks, Bosmon

2016-09-09T15:21:26 <colinclark> and most computers still don\'t come with them built-in
2016-09-09T15:23:29 <kavya> I have ACR122u and used it to key in for example sammy..now my card is ready with token
2016-09-09T15:25:44 <gloob> awesome, I need one of that!
2016-09-09T15:36:03 <colinclark> kavya: so it sounds like it\'s working?
2016-09-09T15:36:07 <colinclark> you have everything you need?
2016-09-09T15:37:56 * jhung joined the channel
2016-09-09T15:39:13 <kavya> Yes..so i think i can use ACR plug in to system start gpii then wave nfc card(with token sammy) on ACR. It should start sammy preferences(bring up magnifier with 200% zoom in)
2016-09-09T15:41:03 <kavya> am i doing it right?
2016-09-09T15:46:28 <kavya> Yes..its working fine

2016-09-09T18:28:26 <clown> avtar: pong
2016-09-09T18:28:30 <clown> I solved it.
2016-09-09T18:28:35 <clown> you are no longer needed.
2016-09-09T18:28:39 <clown> ;-)
2016-09-09T18:28:40 <avtar> ah ok
2016-09-09T18:28:46 <avtar> glad to be of service :D

2016-09-09T18:34:48 <simonjb> cindyli: I\'m trying to run docpad locally for infusion-docs but getting an error: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND <my hostname>
2016-09-09T18:34:53 <simonjb> have you seen that before?
2016-09-09T18:35:27 <cindyli> simonjb: did you clone the infusion-docs repo as the "original"
2016-09-09T18:35:42 <cindyli> no
2016-09-09T18:35:56 <cindyli> you don\'t need that for running docpad locally
2016-09-09T18:36:15 <cindyli> give a try
2016-09-09T18:36:34 <simonjb> when I execute \'npm run docpad\' I get the above error

2016-09-09T18:41:45 <simonjb> maybe I need to add my hostname to /etc/hosts :(

2016-09-09T18:44:20 <cindyli> simonjb: it works fine for me. didn\'t see the error. also try removing node_modules/ before starting the first command
2016-09-09T18:45:00 <cindyli> I hit errors at the "npm install" step with the old node_modules/ content
2016-09-09T18:45:30 <cindyli> i think due to the upgrade of the node version
2016-09-09T18:45:52 <simonjb> I did a fresh checkout and no errors at npm install (I think)
2016-09-09T18:49:13 <cindyli> ah ok
2016-09-09T18:50:41 <simonjb> thanks cindyli I will keep digging
2016-09-09T18:52:06 <cindyli> sorry, no help :(
2016-09-09T18:55:17 <cindyli> simonjb: what was the host name you received "not found" error? mine is http://127.0.0.1, which is localhost, curious how could that be not found
2016-09-09T18:55:39 <simonjb> it\'s the hostname of my computer
2016-09-09T18:56:01 <cindyli> ok
2016-09-09T18:56:13 <simonjb> I enabled debugging and it looks like it\'s trying to run a server bound to my hostname rather than localhost or 127.0.0.1
2016-09-09T18:56:44 <simonjb> and presumably does a DNS lookup that fails
2016-09-09T18:59:00 <cindyli> interesting that it uses ur hostname

2016-09-09T19:00:11 <simonjb> I have a HOSTNAME env var set and it\'s using that
2016-09-09T19:00:36 <simonjb> if I override the HOSTNAME var it works: HOSTNAME=localhost docpad run...
2016-09-09T19:01:29 <cindyli> yay! great u figured out
2016-09-09T19:01:35 <simonjb> thanks cindyli
