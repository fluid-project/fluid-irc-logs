2016-12-01T15:48:02 <gtirloni> amatas: cool, thx
2016-12-01T15:50:01 <amatas> gtirloni, but ATM is using a branch of my repository, because of this: https://github.com/idi-ops/ansible-nodejs/pull/31
2016-12-01T15:50:41 <gtirloni> amatas: ah, i think that explains why the-t-in-rtf is missing yarn then
2016-12-01T15:51:03 <amatas> Yup, sorry I just read the email
2016-12-01T15:52:08 <gtirloni> amatas: i just merged that PR
2016-12-01T15:52:33 <gtirloni> amatas: could you answer the-t-in-rtf email then?
2016-12-01T15:55:05 <amatas> Also changed the source of the repository: https://github.com/amatas/vagrant-vmenv/commit/c1250b901777830a9a2c6519308f5cee404bad5e
2016-12-01T15:55:24 <amatas> gtirloni, sure, I\'ll answer ASAP
2016-12-01T15:55:34 <gtirloni> awesome, thank you!
2016-12-01T15:56:24 <simonjb> fluid-everyone: I have a question for our Node.js developers: what strategy do you use when you want to hack on a package that you want to exercise locally from another project (such as adding code to infusion that you want to call from universal)? I\'ve struggled with a good solution to this in the past and was wondering what others do?
2016-12-01T15:56:56 <simonjb> I end up doing recursive copies into node_modules, or making a symbolic link or npm link
2016-12-01T15:57:17 <Justin_o> simonjb: i\'ve used npm link but i\'m not sure if there is a better option
2016-12-01T15:57:57 <colinclark> I tend to update the package.json to use filesystem-relative paths for the module being tested
2016-12-01T15:58:11 <colinclark> {"infusion": "../../infusion"}
2016-12-01T15:58:14 <simonjb> and then npm install to pull in the changes?
2016-12-01T15:58:16 <colinclark> yeah
2016-12-01T15:58:28 <colinclark> but it\'s pretty awful, and the issue of prepublish scripts not being run comes up
2016-12-01T15:59:25 <colinclark> sometimes i\'ll do a variant of this
2016-12-01T15:59:36 <colinclark> and just issue a "npm install ../../infusion" in the appropriate spot
2016-12-01T16:02:30 <simonjb> thanks Justin_o and colinclark
2016-12-01T16:06:12 <amatas> simonjb, colinclark perhaps you can make use of the NODE_PATH environment variable to store the path to an alternative node_modules directory where your changed modules are. It\'s just an idea.  https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_loading_from_the_global_folders

2016-12-01T17:01:29 <stegru> actually, I can\'t remember what it was I wanted to bring up
2016-12-01T17:01:45 <Bosmon5> Ok - sounds like it\'s an invitation to SKIP ITT : P
2016-12-01T17:02:00 <jhernandez> in my case I\'ve been struggling with the screen resolution thing - still need to keep investigating
2016-12-01T17:02:29 <jhernandez> so yeah, SKIP IT
2016-12-01T17:02:50 <Bosmon5> simonjb - I\'m sorry to say what I tend to do is to randomly copy and paste active files from my dev copy of the module into the target\'s dependencies
2016-12-01T17:03:44 <simonjb> Bosmon5: yeah, I often do that also -- but it felt to me like there _must_ be a better way :)
2016-12-01T17:04:38 <colinclark> one would think, yes :)

2016-12-01T18:23:56 <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: google is offering to do automated fuzz testing for some OSS projects. I\'m not sure GPII would qualify for that. However, it is a type of testing that may want to be considered to be run against it. https://opensource.googleblog.com/2016/12/announcing-oss-fuzz-continuous-fuzzing.html
2016-12-01T18:24:40 <Justin_o> cindyli, kavya: ^

2016-12-01T18:31:27 <Justin_o> cindyli, kavya; np, perhaps one of the fuzzing engines they mention would be useful

2016-12-01T18:33:05 <Justin_o> i just left a comment, but you may have some thoughts too
2016-12-01T18:37:03 <jhung> Yeah. I think the instructions can be more general than that Justin_o. I\'ll leave a comment.

2016-12-01T18:43:13 <cindyli> Justin_o, kavya, "To be accepted to OSS-Fuzz, an open-source project must have a significant user base and/or be critical to the global IT infrastructure."
2016-12-01T18:43:17 <cindyli> from https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz
2016-12-01T18:44:24 <Justin_o> cindyli: "be critical to the global IT infrastructure" has been left for interpretation
2016-12-01T18:45:15 <Justin_o> cindyli: from the e-mail i got announcing it "*In order for a project to be accepted to OSS-Fuzz, it needs to have a large user base and/or be critical to Global IT infrastructure, a general heuristic that we are intentionally leaving open to interpretation at this early stage.*"
2016-12-01T18:46:16 <Justin_o> cindyli: that being said, i\'m not sure it\'s an appropriate fit, but still something we may want to look at introducing on our own.
2016-12-01T18:46:16 <cindyli> haha, a nice side note
2016-12-01T18:47:29 <cindyli> https://security.googleblog.com/2016/08/guided-in-process-fuzzing-of-chrome.html provides a guide of in process fuzzing of chrome components, talking about libs used etc. not sure how practical to set up our own fuzzing testing infrastructure
2016-12-01T18:53:44 <cindyli> Justin_o: according to https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz#bug-disclosure-guidelines, "90-day deadline. After notifying project authors, we will open reported issues in 90 days, or 7 days after the fix is released." it sounds like more for mature and released projects, not for in-dev mode projects like GPII
2016-12-01T18:54:46 <Justin_o> cindyli: yah, i don\'t know how hard it would be to set up fuzzing infrastructure either
2016-12-01T18:54:52 <cindyli> would be great to have our own automated testing suite to auto detect security issues.
2016-12-01T18:54:54 <Justin_o> perhaps gtirloni or avtar would have thoughts on that
2016-12-01T18:55:05 <Justin_o> cindyli: yes, it would :)
2016-12-01T18:57:33 <gtirloni> it\'s something we\'d have to allocate some time to research, i don\'t have any ideas right now.
2016-12-01T18:58:06 <gtirloni> from what i\'ve read about this topic in the past, it requires extensive knowledge of the code base that is being fuzzed
2016-12-01T18:58:57 <gtirloni> (i.e. it\'s probably not something gtirloni/avtar/amatas will install a tool, run it on the git repo and bed done with it)
2016-12-01T18:59:07 <Justin_o> :)
2016-12-01T19:00:16 <gtirloni> if it\'s important for GPII/APCP, my suggestion is to create a JIRA for that and work with Sandra maybe? to allocate some time for this. it\'s a big project.
2016-12-01T19:01:18 <Justin_o> gtirloni: i\'ll leave that to cindyli and kavya. I\'m not sure of  the importance for GPII/APCP
2016-12-01T19:01:33 <gtirloni> ok
2016-12-01T19:01:51 <gtirloni> it\'s certaintly a very interesting topic. very likely to contribute a lot of discoveries in the security area
2016-12-01T19:03:07 <cindyli> adding to our security plan for a future topic so it doesn\'t slip out of our mind
