2016-06-15T17:07:14 <colinclark> jhernandez_, avtar: I put a note on the pull request that switches us to 32-bit Node.js
2016-06-15T17:07:24 <colinclark> I can\'t tell if I\'m being really dumb
2016-06-15T17:07:36 <colinclark> but wouldn\'t this work just as well against master?
2016-06-15T17:10:13 <jhernandez_> colinclark: yup it\'ll work the other way round too
2016-06-15T17:10:30 <colinclark> My impression is that we should make the pull request against master
2016-06-15T17:10:36 <colinclark> and, if it tests out, merge it now
2016-06-15T17:10:46 <colinclark> as per my "no brainer" proposal last night
2016-06-15T17:10:57 <colinclark> passing tests and a working system makes everyone happy
2016-06-15T17:11:20 <colinclark> then if gloob\'s stuff rocks, which it seems that it does, we can fix the issues and, in that pull request, switch back to 64-bit node
2016-06-15T17:11:25 * styki has quit
2016-06-15T17:11:27 <colinclark> does this seem broadly sane?
2016-06-15T17:12:10 <jhernandez_> yup, "no brainer"  broadly sane
2016-06-15T17:12:13 <jhernandez_> xD
2016-06-15T17:12:22 * sepidehshahi has quit
2016-06-15T17:13:51 <jhernandez_> we can even merge both and write a JIRA named "fix spiSettingsHandler tests on node.js 64-bit"
2016-06-15T17:13:59 <jhernandez_> colinclark: ^
2016-06-15T17:14:24 <colinclark> I\'m not quite sure why...
2016-06-15T17:14:33 <colinclark> but my temptation is to batch up the 64-bit fixes together
2016-06-15T17:14:43 <colinclark> and test and merge them when they\'re ready
2016-06-15T17:14:53 <colinclark> part of the reason, I think, is that it will be good for everyone to have the build passing
2016-06-15T17:14:57 <colinclark> know that it can pass :)
2016-06-15T17:15:05 <colinclark> and then move towards an incrementalism that keeps it passing
2016-06-15T17:15:42 <jhernandez_> okay, then we need avtar to reissue the pr agains windows/master
2016-06-15T17:16:05 <colinclark> ok, cool
2016-06-15T17:16:09 <jhernandez_> I\'ve already tested it, and it "obviously" worked
2016-06-15T17:16:11 <jhernandez_> :)
2016-06-15T17:16:18 <colinclark> it\'ll be profoundly awesome
2016-06-15T17:16:35 <avtar> colinclark, jhernandez_: i\'ll do that in about an hour
2016-06-15T17:16:40 <colinclark> yay
2016-06-15T17:16:50 <colinclark> thanks avtar
2016-06-15T17:17:26 <jhernandez_> avtar: cool, thanks!! gotta leave again, but will be able to merge it later
2016-06-15T17:17:28 <jhernandez_> :)

2016-06-15T17:53:11 <PaliwalSparsh> The second one where msg.lang = "fr-FR" sounds same as it does in en-US, ie it is not reciting it with french accent, rather with the english accent only.
2016-06-15T17:53:20 <PaliwalSparsh> Please can you help me with this.

2016-06-15T18:24:24 <PaliwalSparsh> Thanks Justin_o
2016-06-15T18:24:39 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: i put your code in a  jsfiddle https://jsfiddle.net/svodneqm/
2016-06-15T18:24:43 <Justin_o> it seems to be working for me
2016-06-15T18:24:54 * clown has quit
2016-06-15T18:25:08 <PaliwalSparsh> Code is working but the french accent is not coming
2016-06-15T18:25:25 <PaliwalSparsh> what i feel is that in the second one also it takes language as en-US
2016-06-15T18:25:30 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: if it\'s not working for you, it could be that your system doesn\'t have a french voice available
2016-06-15T18:25:50 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: maybe try another language and see if it\'s  different
2016-06-15T18:25:58 * amatas joined the channel
2016-06-15T18:27:08 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: also you can use the fluid.textToSpeech component that comes with infusion https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/components/textToSpeech/js/TextToSpeech.js
2016-06-15T18:27:57 <PaliwalSparsh> Justin_o: I never knew that I always thought these came packages with the browser, I read that chrome has support for abt 14 languages and safari for abt 40 languages.
2016-06-15T18:28:18 <PaliwalSparsh> Cool I will have a look at the text to speech of infusion.
2016-06-15T18:28:29 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: i think they might pick up what\'s on the OS and Google also packages some of its own
2016-06-15T18:28:58 <PaliwalSparsh> So what do you think should we not use the webspeech API then.
2016-06-15T18:29:09 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: if the First Discovery Tool works for you, then it\'s not the voice that\'s the issue
2016-06-15T18:29:34 <PaliwalSparsh> Yes the first Discovery works fine.
2016-06-15T18:29:43 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: the fluid.textToSpeech component also uses the Web Speech API, but it\'s already wrapped up in a component for you to use
2016-06-15T18:31:02 * clown joined the channel
2016-06-15T18:31:04 <PaliwalSparsh> ok then I will have a look at textToSpeech.
2016-06-15T18:32:33 <PaliwalSparsh> Thanks
2016-06-15T18:32:52 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: i\'ve updated your example and it seems to work on my machine. https://jsfiddle.net/svodneqm/1/
2016-06-15T18:32:59 <Justin_o> can you try it again on yours
2016-06-15T18:33:15 * michelled joined the channel
2016-06-15T18:33:17 <PaliwalSparsh> sure i will check it now
2016-06-15T18:36:26 * Yan_Hu has quit
2016-06-15T18:37:05 <PaliwalSparsh> It sounds same with en-US and fr-FR, thats why I guess I thought it was not working.

2016-06-15T18:39:34 <PaliwalSparsh> Justin_o: I guess i am confused because the pronounciation was not matching with the one in google transalator.

2016-06-15T19:04:08 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: yes, those all sound different to me
2016-06-15T19:04:15 <gloob> PaliwalSparsh: correct form is "\xc2\xbfCual es tu nombre?"
2016-06-15T19:04:23 <gloob> without accent a
2016-06-15T19:04:31 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: with i guess the last one being the only correct one
2016-06-15T19:04:32 <gloob> and with double spanish question mark
2016-06-15T19:06:11 <gloob> and they all sounds differents

2016-06-15T21:36:39 <colinclark> simonjb: I posted eight or so issues to Dinuka\'s music controls repository today with some suggestions and improvements
2016-06-15T21:36:44 <colinclark> He\'s written some really great code
2016-06-15T21:36:51 <colinclark> and these suggestions will hopefully make it even cooler
2016-06-15T21:38:11 <colinclark> To me, the two biggest issues are 1) not inadvertently disabling standard keyboard shortcuts in event handlers and 2) externalizing the use of the web audio API so that it\'s a feature of his demonstration, but not integral to the piano
2016-06-15T21:39:59 <simonjb> that\'s great, thanks very much colinclark
2016-06-15T21:41:16 <colinclark> I think #2 will improve the factoring of his code a lot
2016-06-15T21:41:26 <colinclark> since it will involve exposing more events
2016-06-15T21:41:34 <colinclark> which the controller itself can listen for
2016-06-15T21:42:00 <colinclark> I\'m quite excited to try using these controls soon!

2016-06-15T14:07:16 <gtirloni> kasparnet, hi! just noticed last week\'s pad is world-writable (world!). maybe we should make it read-only. it seems the way to do it is to configure the pad and change its visibility (stop inheriting permissions from folder, choose read-only)
2016-06-15T14:10:57 <cindyli> hi Bosmon, i think i finally find out what causes the issue yesterday that a unit test returns an empty object after adding debugging logs before and after this line: https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/blob/master/lib/dataSource-core.js#L316
2016-06-15T14:11:23 <cindyli> the "resp" value before the model transformation is correct, looks like:
2016-06-15T14:11:29 <cindyli> {"type":"user","name":"chromehc","password":"chromehc","defaultGpiiToken":"chrome_high_contrast","_id":"user-1","_rev":"1-c046f70c35a36b112a5da374e1a8c1e5"}
2016-06-15T14:11:44 <cindyli> however, the transformation rule is { \'\': \'value\' }
2016-06-15T14:12:02 <cindyli> there\'s no "value" field in the "resp" value as u can see
2016-06-15T14:12:55 <cindyli> the question is, shall kettle.dataSource.CouchDB assumes the valuable response should be response.value?
2016-06-15T14:14:27 <cindyli> requests like http://localhost:1234/db_name/record_id return a flat document without having a "value" property
2016-06-15T14:14:46 * jhung joined the channel
2016-06-15T14:16:31 * wale joined the channel
2016-06-15T14:17:59 <cindyli> my opinion is to return whatever the full response is without going thru transformations. otherwise, whoever uses couchDB data source for this type of requests will have to overwrite the transformation rule
2016-06-15T14:18:06 <cindyli> what do you think, Bosmon
2016-06-15T14:20:08 <cindyli> to make the explanation complete, after line 316, the empty object is returned rather than the desired response before that line
2016-06-15T14:24:14 <cindyli> now my test passes once I change kettle.dataSource.CouchDB option "rules.readPayload" with {"": ""}

2016-06-15T14:44:19 <avtar> hey jhernandez_
2016-06-15T14:55:15 <Bosmon> cindyli - ok, I see - the transform that the dataSource reads is meant to be compatible with the one it writes
2016-06-15T14:55:21 <Bosmon> Which is why it applies the "value" rule
2016-06-15T14:55:36 <cindyli> ok
2016-06-15T14:55:38 <Bosmon> Without this, there would be some JSON payloads which might cause the dataSource to fail
2016-06-15T14:55:50 <Bosmon> E.g. ones which have members named "_id" and "_rev" etc.
2016-06-15T14:56:07 <Bosmon> It\'s certainly a slightly awkward issue, and at the very least we should document it more clearly
2016-06-15T14:56:36 <cindyli> i see. thanks
2016-06-15T14:58:55 <jhung> hey cindyli and Justin_o. I was talking with styki about UIO Mobile. The text-size adjuster is a bit different in mobile than on "desktop" (see here https://wiki.fluidproject.org/download/attachments/66551842/mobil%20UIO%202016-03.png?version=1&modificationDate=1455145400591&api=v2).
2016-06-15T14:59:28 <Justin_o> buttons instead of a slider
2016-06-15T14:59:36 <jhung> We were thinking that rather than try to make the existing adjuster work in both views, we would create a new adjuster specifically for mobile.
2016-06-15T15:00:25 <jhung> So a couple questions: 1. does this seem like a reasonable approach (new adjuster vs. modifying the existing one).
2016-06-15T15:00:48 <Justin_o> jhung: you could make use of the context aware system in the framework, but you\'d also have to make sure things re-rendered when switching from a desktop to mobile layout
2016-06-15T15:01:20 <jhung> Justin_o: ok cool. Are there examples?
2016-06-15T15:01:22 <Bosmon> Justin_o, jhung - you should chat to alanharnum who has sound experience of the context aware system :)
2016-06-15T15:01:37 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i was just going to say that :)
2016-06-15T15:01:44 <alanharnum> and even for sliders
2016-06-15T15:01:50 <alanharnum> :)
2016-06-15T15:02:33 <jhung> alanharnum: perfect! :) Do you have examples you can share? styki is going to try to learn to do this.
2016-06-15T15:02:41 <alanharnum> check out this PR: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/705
2016-06-15T15:02:59 <alanharnum> the context-awareness stuff is pretty straightforward
2016-06-15T15:03:30 <alanharnum> http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/ContextAwareness.html
2016-06-15T15:04:19 <alanharnum> the PR is something I\'ve been working on that adds a native HTML slider to the existing jQuery-based one.
2016-06-15T15:04:27 <alanharnum> and uses context-awareness to manage which one gets used
2016-06-15T15:04:35 <jhung> alanharnum: awesome.
2016-06-15T15:05:00 <alanharnum> https://github.com/waharnum/infusion/blob/8e41ec73bc87e00cdea47e3b882c2aa20ad1840f/src/components/textfieldSlider/js/TextfieldSlider.js is probably most relevant

2016-06-15T15:05:43 <jhung> Thanks. Will take a look at that.
2016-06-15T15:05:51 <styki> alanharnum: Thanks. I will have a look and text here if I have any questions.
2016-06-15T15:06:23 <alanharnum> styki: sure thing
2016-06-15T15:11:58 <PaliwalSparsh> Hi guys this is week 3 blog for the GSoC project Discovery cat. I hope it makes a small fun read.

2016-06-15T15:16:18 <alanharnum> one day i hope to actually do something with Phaser :)

2016-06-15T15:21:09 <PaliwalSparsh> Thanks alanharnum :) and you can also use the wrapper you helped with
2016-06-15T15:21:21 <kasparnet> I\'ve mucked around a bit in there, and have a hard time figuring out how to change the permissions
2016-06-15T15:21:29 <kasparnet> seems you can only do so on a folder leve

2016-06-15T15:53:11 <cindyli> Bosmon: when using kettle.dataSource.CouchDB, would you suggest to wrap actual fields into the "value" object? right now, i\'m using flat structure that fields are at the same level with _id and _rev. I wonder if this would cause problem at updating/creating docs where CouchDB component automatically handles the first step of fetching _id and _rev.
2016-06-15T15:53:49 <Bosmon> Well, you might like to just go with the default, yes
2016-06-15T15:54:08 <Bosmon> I always worry that Couch might put some additional fields at top level too
2016-06-15T15:54:10 <cindyli> ok. cool. good to know it at this early stage. thanks, Bosmon
2016-06-15T15:54:28 <Bosmon> But I\'m not sure it can really be argued to be a "best practice"...
2016-06-15T15:54:40 <cindyli> true
2016-06-15T15:54:48 * clown joined the channel
2016-06-15T15:54:57 <Bosmon> I liked the idea of "value" since it leaves the top level free for other "out of band" info
2016-06-15T15:55:07 <Bosmon> For example I remember in the Engage days we used to have a "isError" field
2016-06-15T15:55:41 <Bosmon> Actually we know there is at least one other field Couch will put at top level, "_conflicts"
2016-06-15T15:55:53 <cindyli> well, not very natural thou for someone coming from the RDB world
2016-06-15T15:56:22 <Bosmon> Well, I\'m not sure what we can do with such people :)
2016-06-15T15:56:33 <cindyli> haha
2016-06-15T15:57:15 <Bosmon> Perhaps we can interest them in some J2EE technology :)
