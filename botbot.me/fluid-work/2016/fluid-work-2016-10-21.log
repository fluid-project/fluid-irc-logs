2016-10-21T13:40:15 <cindyli> the-t-in-rtf: are you off for today? wonder if you have time to talk about gpii-pouchdb cleanup()
2016-10-21T13:40:27 <the-t-in-rtf> I am working today.
2016-10-21T13:42:17 <cindyli> ok. i\'m trying with the latest cleanup() and still seeing the file system is not fully cleaned up. there are db files left in the system temp dir after running tests,
2016-10-21T13:42:26 <cindyli> the-t-in-rtf: ^
2016-10-21T13:42:37 <the-t-in-rtf> ok, give me a few minutes and we can do a screen share.
2016-10-21T13:42:54 <cindyli> sure. thanks
2016-10-21T13:43:00 <the-t-in-rtf> In the mean time, can you create a pastie with ls output?
2016-10-21T13:43:04 <the-t-in-rtf> I want to see what type of files.
2016-10-21T13:43:53 <cindyli> sure
2016-10-21T13:44:41 <cindyli> the-t-in-rtf: http://pastebin.com/F707wFeK let me know if you wanna have a look into the db dir
2016-10-21T13:44:51 <cindyli> all dirs starting with 33d*
2016-10-21T13:45:47 <the-t-in-rtf> can you add the contents of one of the dirs?
2016-10-21T13:45:57 <the-t-in-rtf> (I mean output that shows one)
2016-10-21T13:46:05 <the-t-in-rtf> it\'s normal for the directory itself to be left behind.
2016-10-21T13:47:33 <cindyli> the-t-in-rtf: http://pastebin.com/W4EQNuJc
2016-10-21T13:47:55 <cindyli> the dir name is different this time \'cuz i\'ve removed old ones and re-ran tests
2016-10-21T13:48:34 <the-t-in-rtf> config.json is my fault.
2016-10-21T13:48:40 <the-t-in-rtf> and tiny.
2016-10-21T13:48:50 <the-t-in-rtf> the other two are ones that express-pouchdb creates.
2016-10-21T13:49:05 <the-t-in-rtf> you can probably get rid of those by defining those two dbs in your pouch instance.
2016-10-21T13:49:19 <the-t-in-rtf> I believe I did something similar in my own work, I will find a link, just a minute.
2016-10-21T13:49:47 <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. if you create them, express-pouchdb won\'t have to, and you\'ll have what you need to clean them up afterward.
2016-10-21T13:50:18 <the-t-in-rtf> not 100% sure if you can do the same with pouch__all_dbs__
2016-10-21T13:52:00 <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/the-t-in-rtf/gpii-pouchdb/blob/GPII-1897/tests/js/pouch-config.js
2016-10-21T13:52:18 <the-t-in-rtf> You can replace the _users definition with one more like _replicator
2016-10-21T13:52:38 <the-t-in-rtf> and apparently you can define pouch__all_dbs__
2016-10-21T13:53:20 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, with those three definitions added to your list of databases, you should end up with just a few bytes per run.
2016-10-21T13:53:30 <the-t-in-rtf> Make sense? @cindyli ^^^
2016-10-21T13:55:30 <cindyli> the-t-in-rtf: i\'m thinking i probably should add a step myself to delete that folder. it seems cleanup() only deletes the specific subfolder for that database. but since i know I only use one database in this case, i probably can go ahead to delete the express basedir
2016-10-21T13:55:45 <the-t-in-rtf> I would still add the database defs
2016-10-21T13:55:46 <cindyli> rather than having a confusing pouch-config
2016-10-21T13:55:54 <the-t-in-rtf> put a comment in.
2016-10-21T13:56:39 <cindyli> but that approach still leaves many stray directories in the temp dir.
2016-10-21T13:56:55 <the-t-in-rtf> that\'s fine.
2016-10-21T13:57:02 <the-t-in-rtf> there are thousands from common programs.
2016-10-21T13:57:08 <the-t-in-rtf> it\'s a temp directory
2016-10-21T13:57:35 <cindyli> haha
2016-10-21T13:59:44 <the-t-in-rtf> it used to be that you might have too many files in a single directory, but on modern machines those limits are very high.
2016-10-21T13:59:51 <the-t-in-rtf> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/466521/how-many-files-can-i-put-in-a-directory
2016-10-21T14:00:13 <the-t-in-rtf> The database cleanup takes care of a bigger problem, which is that you\'d gradually lose a noticeable amount of storage
2016-10-21T14:00:32 <the-t-in-rtf> or not gradually, depending on how much data you load in each run.
2016-10-21T14:04:14 <cindyli> the-t-in-rtf: this search shows how often or whether ever the system temp dir gets automatically cleaned up - http://superuser.com/questions/296824/when-is-a-windows-users-temp-directory-cleaned-out
2016-10-21T14:04:29 <cindyli> seems mac does it every three days but windows never does
2016-10-21T14:04:57 <cindyli> running gpii all-tests.js once will leave about 100 those db dirs in the temp dir
2016-10-21T14:06:42 <the-t-in-rtf> so, given that you have 4.2 billion directory entries, you\'d have problems if you run the tests more than 42 million times.
2016-10-21T14:07:49 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, I obviously thought it was an OK strategy previously, the danger is really that someone might try to store the databases in a directory that already exists and which contains other stuff they care about.
2016-10-21T14:07:59 <the-t-in-rtf> you ran into this yourself.
2016-10-21T14:08:12 * colinclark has quit
2016-10-21T14:10:02 <the-t-in-rtf> it seems like an OK strategy for a particular test environment in a particular package, but not a safe one for wider reuse.
2016-10-21T14:15:59 * michelled joined the channel
2016-10-21T14:16:06 <the-t-in-rtf> sorry, by "OK strategy", I meant clearing out the directory as we used to do, and as you were proposing.

2016-10-21T18:30:22 <alanharnum> speculated to be the work of a Mirai-based botnet (Mirai is code that infects IoT devices with poor security, which is to say lots of them, and turns them into a DDOS botnet): https://www.incapsula.com/blog/malware-analysis-mirai-ddos-botnet.html
