2016-09-15T18:52:29 <Justin_o> avtar: do you remember what resources i was supposed to start of the Fedora VM with to test FLUID-5952. I set it to 1 CPU and 1GB of Ram and can\'t reproduce it again today
2016-09-15T18:54:49 <avtar> Justin_o: that should do it
2016-09-15T18:55:01 <avtar> how are you triggering the test runs?
2016-09-15T18:55:27 <Justin_o> avtar: manually in the vm and using the python server there
2016-09-15T18:55:38 <Justin_o> i did this yesterday and it failed
2016-09-15T18:55:43 <Justin_o> very strange :(
2016-09-15T18:56:26 <avtar> and you\'ve run them at least 3 or 4 times?
2016-09-15T18:57:37 <Justin_o> avtar: i had run them individually a few times, but i\'ll try again in the all-tests

2016-09-15T19:02:43 <Justin_o> they seem to be both related to focus though
2016-09-15T19:03:21 <avtar> yeah i\'ve only had those fail when i forgot to leave the browser in focus in the vm
2016-09-15T19:04:06 <Justin_o> avtar: unfortunately qunit tries to rerun failed tests first so i think they are executing too fast and my focus is still in the browser chrome or something
2016-09-15T19:04:41 <Justin_o> avtar: by the way just running the separatedPanel tests themselves has now reproduced the error after a few tries.
2016-09-15T19:04:45 <Justin_o> thanks

2016-09-15T20:49:20 <lliskovoi> interesting, Firfox discontinued support for Firefox Hello two days ago
2016-09-15T20:56:45 <colinclark> wow
2016-09-15T20:56:55 <colinclark> they do a lot of that, I\'m not sure why
2016-09-15T21:00:33 <alanharnum> colinclark: they seem to have a very Google-like "watch the numbers, stop support if not being used" attitude

2016-09-15T11:57:56 <kasparnet> heya Bosmon, Bosmon7
2016-09-15T11:58:05 <kasparnet> I was just looking at https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/462
2016-09-15T11:58:24 <kasparnet> and not sure in what way we should use the settingshandlers
2016-09-15T11:59:25 <kasparnet> were you thinking that I should extend the file settingshandlers with an extra "create" function or something, that would be callable from the makeConfigurable block?
2016-09-15T11:59:51 <kasparnet> the current contract is that settingshandlers should have a .set and .get function
2016-09-15T12:00:47 <Bosmon7> kasparnet - surely, if we receive a set for a nonexistent file, we create it?
2016-09-15T12:01:32 <kasparnet> Bosmon7: the issue we currently have is that we always do a .get first (to read the current settings) before setting the new ones
2016-09-15T12:01:39 <kasparnet> and the read makes the system fail
2016-09-15T12:01:50 <kasparnet> because it attempts to read a non-existing file
2016-09-15T12:01:52 <Bosmon7> Well, that\'s a bit crap isn\'t it :)
2016-09-15T12:02:00 <kasparnet> it\'s totally crap
2016-09-15T12:02:10 <Bosmon7> Read of a nonexistent file should return undefined
2016-09-15T12:02:51 <kasparnet> yeah, that makes sense
2016-09-15T12:02:53 <kasparnet> in some ways I\'d argue that it\'s a different problem from the one this pull request is about though
2016-09-15T12:03:01 <Bosmon7> Yes, it is
2016-09-15T12:03:12 <Bosmon7> But that\'s no reason that the pull request should introduce untested, duplicate functionality : P
2016-09-15T12:03:23 <kasparnet> that\'s true
2016-09-15T12:05:20 <kasparnet> Bosmon7: I guess I\'m not using that functionality anywhere at all in the code either
2016-09-15T12:05:32 <Bosmon7> kasparnet - yes, I observed that : P
2016-09-15T12:05:38 <kasparnet> ... Bosmon7: would it be acceptable if I leave that code completely out of the PR
2016-09-15T12:05:44 <Bosmon7> kasparnet - totally acceptable :)
2016-09-15T12:05:54 <kasparnet> and perhaps create a new pull request with the .get fix
2016-09-15T12:06:06 <Bosmon7> We can raise "allow ability to invoke settings handlers from a makeConfigurable block" as a separate JIRA
2016-09-15T12:06:29 <kasparnet> Bosmon7: yeah
2016-09-15T12:07:10 <kasparnet> ... but generally, it does mke sense that all our file settingshandlers return undefined on read, instead of exploding, right?
2016-09-15T12:07:25 <kasparnet> because in that case, I can just as well fix that now
2016-09-15T12:07:31 <kasparnet> it\'s been a pretty annoying issue for a while
2016-09-15T12:07:41 <Bosmon7> Yes
2016-09-15T12:07:52 <Bosmon7> It is responsible for that system crash with RWG for a start
2016-09-15T12:08:23 <kasparnet> yup
2016-09-15T12:08:31 <kasparnet> ...and has been for 4 years :D
2016-09-15T12:09:43 <Bosmon7> Well, with stegru around, we\'re clearing out a lot of things that have been plaguing us for 4 years
2016-09-15T12:09:55 <Bosmon7> It\'s a bit mysterious to have someone whose weekly updates just consist of "yep, done that"
2016-09-15T12:11:03 <stegru> so I\'m dealing with the crap that everyone else avoided
2016-09-15T12:12:47 <kasparnet> hahaha, indeed, stegru -- and I cant tell you how much it\'s appreciated

2016-09-15T13:54:25 <cindyli> reported from its dev dependency gpii-express
2016-09-15T13:54:59 <cindyli> kettle is also the dev dependency within gpii-express. so kettle was not installed when running kettle "npm install"
2016-09-15T13:55:17 <cindyli> i mean kettle wasn\'t installed for gpii-express
2016-09-15T13:55:17 <Bosmon7> Hi there cindyli
2016-09-15T13:55:20 <cindyli> hi
2016-09-15T13:55:22 <Bosmon7> Was this via npm 3 by any chance?
2016-09-15T13:55:43 <cindyli> smart!!
2016-09-15T13:55:47 <cindyli> thanks, Bosmon7
2016-09-15T13:55:50 <Bosmon7> It\'s the only possibility
2016-09-15T13:55:51 <cindyli> 3.9.5
2016-09-15T13:55:55 <Bosmon7> Since none of us have observed this problem before
2016-09-15T13:55:58 <cindyli> switching version

2016-09-15T13:59:12 <Bosmon7> cindyli - we\'re still on the node 4.x LTS ecosystem for the time being
2016-09-15T13:59:41 <Bosmon7> So you could say we "officially support" whatever npm is distributed with today\'s node 4.5.0 LTS release

2016-09-15T14:30:44 <colinclark> hey ewbjr, sorry I missed your note yesterday--somehow I don\'t get notifications of private messages on IRC, and missed your message here in the channel too
2016-09-15T14:30:54 * lliskovoi joined the channel
2016-09-15T14:31:09 <colinclark> gtirloni and I are still working on getting our vendor\'s assistance for the WebRTC gateway
2016-09-15T14:31:13 <colinclark> taking a little longer than expected
2016-09-15T14:31:39 <colinclark> lliskovoi and I have been working on a set of milestones and features for the accessible client: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Designing+an+Accessible+Vidyo+Client
2016-09-15T14:31:51 <colinclark> I wonder if you\'ve got some free time this afternoon to chat with us about it, ewbjr?
2016-09-15T14:34:31 <ewbjr> colinclark: np, I was also thinking that since the ios example wasn\'t rtc and just relied on the API, that it might work with the existing server?
2016-09-15T14:34:39 <colinclark> ewbjr, yup it should
2016-09-15T14:34:49 <colinclark> you can connect to the portal anytime you want with it
2016-09-15T14:34:54 <colinclark> you have all the details?
2016-09-15T14:35:07 <ewbjr> nope, would you be able to share those with me?
2016-09-15T14:35:18 <colinclark> You shouldn\'t need any more than the URL
2016-09-15T14:35:27 <colinclark> conf.inclusivedesign.ca
2016-09-15T14:35:36 <colinclark> Is there more you need, ewbjr?
2016-09-15T14:36:08 * gtirloni murmurs "don\'t forget it\'s https"
2016-09-15T14:37:44 <ewbjr> there\'s 2 logins in the example, login to vidyoportal and guest login. First is asking for url, username, password and the 2nd lists url, roomkey, guestname and room pin if any
2016-09-15T14:38:40 * danayo joined the channel
2016-09-15T14:39:38 <colinclark> ewbjr: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Vidyo+video+conferencing
2016-09-15T14:39:54 <colinclark> You\'ll find a guest URL for the fluid_standup room there
2016-09-15T14:40:24 <colinclark> so I believe it breaks down like this
2016-09-15T14:40:48 <ewbjr> thank you
2016-09-15T14:40:56 <colinclark> url: https://conf.inclusivedesign.ca, roomkey: xemU59x8DtnO41eCMtCpCioWaRI
2016-09-15T14:40:58 <colinclark> no pin
2016-09-15T14:41:04 <colinclark> and of course the guest name is user-specified
2016-09-15T14:41:29 <colinclark> gtirloni will arrange to make you a user account on the Vidyo system
2016-09-15T14:41:49 <colinclark> Are you free at 4 pm today, ewbjr?
2016-09-15T14:42:30 <ewbjr> perfect, and yes will skype work?
2016-09-15T14:48:08 * jessm joined the channel
2016-09-15T14:51:58 <colinclark> yup, skype\'s fine
2016-09-15T14:52:05 <colinclark> or we can use your shiny new vidyo account :)
2016-09-15T14:52:17 <colinclark> ewbjr: ^
2016-09-15T14:52:24 <colinclark> lliskovoi: That time still works for you, too?
2016-09-15T14:52:36 <ewbjr> :)
2016-09-15T14:54:16 <lliskovoi> 4 works for me!
