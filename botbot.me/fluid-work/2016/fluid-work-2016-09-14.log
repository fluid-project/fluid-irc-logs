b'2016-09-14T20:12:06 <Bosmon7> But I can\'t figure out what it means
2016-09-14T20:12:08 <cindyli> i know someone will ask about that
2016-09-14T20:12:10 <Bosmon7> There doesn\'t seem to be a pull request
2016-09-14T20:12:22 <Bosmon7> And it claims to be directed against the kettle repository itself
2016-09-14T20:12:29 <Bosmon7> Apparently, about a branch which doesn\'t exist....
2016-09-14T20:12:31 <cindyli> i mistakenly pushed a branch to gpii/kettle, removed it right after
2016-09-14T20:12:41 <Bosmon7> ah ok
2016-09-14T20:12:47 <cindyli> was intended to push to my own repo. sorry about that
2016-09-14T20:12:59 <cindyli> it will spam everyone, i know
2016-09-14T20:13:20 <Bosmon7> That\'s fine
2016-09-14T20:13:33 <Bosmon7> Ok, so your idea is to split off the filesystem dataSource support from the URL support
2016-09-14T20:13:36 <Bosmon7> That seems reasonable
2016-09-14T20:13:39 <cindyli> yes
2016-09-14T20:13:57 <Bosmon7> If you do, you should rename the remnant to dataSource-fs.js or so
2016-09-14T20:14:19 <cindyli> that is tony\'s idea, btw. there\'s no browser equivalent support for building a "fs" module
2016-09-14T20:15:04 <cindyli> at the moment, dataSource-node.js still have a require() at the end so it won\'t break all other kettle usage
2016-09-14T20:15:22 <cindyli> if you think it\'s ok to use -fs and -url, i can certainly do that
2016-09-14T20:15:28 * colinclark has quit
2016-09-14T20:15:40 <Bosmon7> That can go into the index file, I imagine
2016-09-14T20:15:57 <Bosmon7> Noone should be requiring individual files out of Kettle
2016-09-14T20:16:19 <cindyli> that\'s true. cool. in action. thanks, Bosmon7
2016-09-14T20:20:30 * colinclark joined the channel
2016-09-14T20:21:01 <cindyli> Bosmon7: shall the file be named as dataSource-file.js to match with the component name? instead of -fs?
2016-09-14T20:21:31 <Bosmon7> Oh sure, file if you like
2016-09-14T20:21:40 <cindyli> thanks

2016-09-14T20:33:37 <gtirloni> alanharnum, you mentioned a win10 computer in lab... just a heads up, the tests i ran here with Edge.. i have the anniversary update applied (so it\'s Edge v38). in case the lab computer might be missing that... it takes a while to update
2016-09-14T20:34:05 <alanharnum> gtirloni: thanks - I was doing the manual tests myself, not the automated ones
2016-09-14T20:34:10 <alanharnum> mainly making sure nothing looks odd

2016-09-14T13:24:36 <Justin_o> alanharnum: for the changes you made to FLUID-5951, the textToSpeech tests should run in Edge right?
2016-09-14T13:24:45 <alanharnum> Justin_o: yes
2016-09-14T13:27:07 <Justin_o> alanharnum: doesn\'t seem to be running for me, but could have something to do with the VM not having a working audio driver
2016-09-14T13:27:23 <Justin_o> I\'ll investigate that some more
2016-09-14T13:27:46 <alanharnum> Justin_o: I tested it at home on my Windows 10 desktop - could also test it on the Windows 10 all-in-one in the lab
2016-09-14T13:38:52 <Justin_o> alanharnum: enabling the audio in the vm allowed the tests to run
2016-09-14T13:39:01 <alanharnum> Justin_o: great
2016-09-14T13:39:10 <alanharnum> did they also pass? :)

2016-09-14T14:49:39 <Justin_o> gtirloni: I\'m going to start looking at FLUID-5952, do you have a simple way to reproduce that so that i can easily debug and test potential fixes?
2016-09-14T14:51:56 <gtirloni> Justin_o: locally i could reproduce it by using testem (but not in \'ci\' mode), like this: `testem --file tests/testem.json`. it should open testem on the console, where you can watch the tests and it\'ll also give you a URL to connect, where you can watch the browser actually doing the tests (that\'s where I got the stack trace from)
2016-09-14T14:53:37 <kavya> stegru: I just saw https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-1540 has been fixed
2016-09-14T14:53:57 <stegru> yes
2016-09-14T14:54:03 <kavya> Want to check if it is ready testing?
2016-09-14T14:54:08 <stegru> yes
2016-09-14T14:54:20 <stegru> it\'s tricky to test
2016-09-14T14:54:40 <stegru> you will need to have a 32-bit version of Windows 10
2016-09-14T14:55:12 <kavya> I think i need to have windows 8+ version with 32 bit right?
2016-09-14T14:55:19 <stegru> yes, that will be ok
2016-09-14T14:56:11 <kavya> ok,can i test it on windows 8+ with 64 bit?
2016-09-14T14:56:30 <stegru> no, because the bug did not exist on 64-bit
2016-09-14T14:56:54 <Justin_o> gtirloni: I haven\'t been able to reproduce it on the mac yet.. i\'m also trying to reproduce it on the fedora vm directly, that is from within the vm itself, not using "grunt tests" and am not getting it either
2016-09-14T14:56:55 <stegru> it was already working with 64-bit
2016-09-14T14:57:14 <kavya> ok..
2016-09-14T14:57:20 <Justin_o> gtirloni: could you double check that you can still reproduce the issue
2016-09-14T14:57:40 <gtirloni> Justin_o: sure, one sec
2016-09-14T14:57:46 <Justin_o> thanks
2016-09-14T14:58:05 <gtirloni> it happens 2 out of 10 times. let me see here how it goes now
2016-09-14T14:58:33 <Justin_o> gtirloni: thanks
2016-09-14T14:59:09 <Justin_o> gtirloni: and please update your master.. i\'ve merged a couple things today
2016-09-14T15:14:53 <gtirloni> Justin_o: i cannot reproduce it locally with the latest changes in infusion
2016-09-14T15:21:43 <Justin_o> gtirloni: i just destroyed my vagrant vm and am trying to run the grunt tests again.
2016-09-14T15:21:58 <Justin_o> gtirloni: I also notice that the error didn\'t show up for the builds on the last merge
2016-09-14T15:22:20 <Justin_o> could be coincidence.. but i\'m thinking that if we can\'t reproduce it, that we should just close it for now, and hope that it was inadvertently fixed.
2016-09-14T15:23:08 <gtirloni> sounds good
2016-09-14T15:25:02 * Jess_ joined the channel
2016-09-14T15:31:01 <Justin_o> gtirloni: looks like it failed on the jenkins build again
2016-09-14T15:31:03 <Justin_o> ;(
2016-09-14T15:32:33 <gtirloni> interesting. i wonder if the latest changes only made it less likely.. since it was consistently failing locally for me last week (2 out 10, sometimes 1 out of 10).. and the jenkins environment just got that now
2016-09-14T15:33:25 <gtirloni> when i was running the tests here locally, i also saw errors on some IoC tests and others i can\'t remember.. so they seem to fail from time to time, in my limited testing (native fedora 24, firefox 48.0.1, browser with focus, no mouse movement)
2016-09-14T15:35:01 <gtirloni> are these tests time sensitive?
2016-09-14T15:37:59 <gtirloni> unfortunately i don\'t know JS enough to understand those traces, so i\'m just guessing here. i have no idea where it\'s failing
2016-09-14T15:51:18 * alanharnum joined the channel
2016-09-14T15:53:56 <Justin_o> gtirloni: it looks like a timing issue, but i\'m not entirely sure what the trace means either.
2016-09-14T15:54:03 * alanharnum joined the channel
2016-09-14T15:54:08 <Justin_o> gtirloni: also how often are tests run by the CI?

2016-09-14T17:11:25 <gtirloni> Justin_o: this is what i used to run it 10x: for n in {1..10}; do echo "${n}th run: "; grunt tests | grep SeparatedPanelPrefsEditor; done

2016-09-14T17:54:01 <avtar> Justin_o: you can also start the vm like this: VM_CPUS=1 VM_RAM=1024 vagrant up
