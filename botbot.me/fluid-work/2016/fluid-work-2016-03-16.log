2016-03-16T17:59:26 <nrda> @cindyli: I have few queries regarding UI Options responsive design project
2016-03-16T17:59:54 <cindyli> go ahead, nrda
2016-03-16T18:02:59 <nrda> @cindyli: In the proposed design, if we increase the text size then the size of the preference bar also increase to accomodate the increased text size in the prefenced bar, but currently if we increase the text size then it doesnot change the text size in preference bar
2016-03-16T18:03:52 <nrda> so is it a new feature that has to added
2016-03-16T18:04:35 <cindyli> nrda: a couple of things i\'d like to clarify, 1, where\'s the preference bar? the part that has the reset and show/hide buttons?
2016-03-16T18:05:00 <nrda> yes
2016-03-16T18:05:06 <cindyli> 2. which demo are you looking at to see the text size in the prefs bar doesn\'t change?
2016-03-16T18:05:33 <akshay> Justin_o: I got this issues while doing the FD unit tests.

2016-03-16T18:09:47 <cindyli> nrda: i believe the text size on those buttons should be adjusted accordingly by the selected font size. you can double check with Dana when she\'s online. she is the designer of this responsive design
2016-03-16T18:10:17 <cindyli> nrda: dana is away today. she will be online early tomorrow morning then be away, and on friday

2016-03-16T21:02:22 <atul_> Hello guys. I am atul and I am looking forward to get started with contributing to infusion code. I have forked, cloned, build the code on my local machine. Now I need to know what to do ahead?a
2016-03-16T21:04:42 * cindyli has quit
2016-03-16T21:09:18 <simonjb> hi atul_ what would you like to do?
2016-03-16T21:10:24 * yzen is now known as yzen_
2016-03-16T21:11:23 <atul_> Hey simonjb, I am trying to work on issue FLUID-5876. And when I try to open "demos/prefsFramework/index.html" in my browser I am getting some error like  "Cross origin requests are only supported for protocol schemes: http, data, chrome, chrome-extension, https, chrome-extension-resource"
2016-03-16T21:13:28 <atul_> Do I need to run some node server for infusion on localhost?

2016-03-16T21:18:07 <simonjb> hi atul_ I don\'t think that this issue that you linked to is actually a real bug unfortunately
2016-03-16T21:18:53 <simonjb> it does appear on the Good First Bugs list but I don\'t think it should be there
2016-03-16T21:19:02 <simonjb> how did you find it?
2016-03-16T21:19:24 <atul_> from here - https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5876
2016-03-16T21:19:43 <simonjb> and where did you find the link to the issue?
2016-03-16T21:20:24 <atul_> I was looking for open issues on https://issues.fluidproject.org/projects/FLUID/issues and there I found it I guess
2016-03-16T21:20:31 * alanharnum has quit
2016-03-16T21:20:36 <simonjb> ok, got it
2016-03-16T21:21:22 <simonjb> to actually address your problem, are you loading "demos/prefsFramework/index.html" from the filesystem into your browser?
2016-03-16T21:21:28 <atul_> Yes
2016-03-16T21:22:17 <simonjb> what I think is likely happening is that you\'ll need to run a local web server and access it though that
2016-03-16T21:22:34 <simonjb> do you have experience configuring a local web server?
2016-03-16T21:22:40 <atul_> Yes.
2016-03-16T21:22:53 <atul_> But is it apache or node server etc?
2016-03-16T21:23:05 <simonjb> any static server would do
2016-03-16T21:23:48 <simonjb> you\'d just need to serve up the directory that you cloned infusion to and access through the web server
2016-03-16T21:24:28 <atul_> Okay. I will give it a try. Thanks for your time simonjb.
2016-03-16T21:24:47 <simonjb> you\'re welcome, let me know if it works
2016-03-16T21:24:53 <atul_> Yes, sure.
2016-03-16T21:26:29 * gloob has quit
2016-03-16T21:27:11 <atul_> that worked with simple http-server. Really appreciate your help.
2016-03-16T21:28:52 <atul_> So simonjb, is FLUID-5876 an issue or not? Because the problem stated in that issue is still there.
2016-03-16T21:35:04 <simonjb> atul_: you are right in that the behaviour that is described is accurate but I\'m not sure that it is a bug -- I didn\'t file the issue and that\'s not my call to make
2016-03-16T21:36:15 <simonjb> and great that the web server fixed your issue
2016-03-16T21:36:28 * colinclark has quit
2016-03-16T21:37:02 <atul_> Okay. Can someone suggest me an first bug to work on please?

2016-03-16T21:41:32 <simonjb> and anything after the first 2
2016-03-16T21:42:22 <simonjb> (that someone else isn\'t already working on)
2016-03-16T21:42:30 <simonjb> and thanks for helping out!
2016-03-16T21:42:47 <atul_> Yes I looked at it and was interested in accessible responsive music UI controls.
2016-03-16T21:44:34 <simonjb> atul_: cool, is that an area that you have experience in?
2016-03-16T21:46:42 <atul_> Yes. I have worked with HTML, CSS3 animations, jQuery for more than 2 years now and am really interested in it. Plus since I use music apps like Spotify and others very often I feel that this is a good fit for me.
2016-03-16T21:49:30 * nrda has quit
2016-03-16T21:50:45 <simonjb> atul_: that\'s great
2016-03-16T21:51:39 <simonjb> atul_: I need to sign off soon -- is there anything I can help with before I go?
2016-03-16T21:52:05 <atul_> Yes
2016-03-16T21:52:10 <atul_> One thing please
2016-03-16T21:53:30 <atul_> Should I start solving bugs related to infusion and then start thinking about the proposal for the project OR can I directly discuss the project details with mentor?
2016-03-16T21:55:38 <simonjb> working on infusion issues is a great way to get familiar with the code but it\'s also fine to discuss project details (and there isn\'t a huge amount of time before the proposal deadline, I think)
2016-03-16T21:56:44 <atul_> Yes 26th March
2016-03-16T21:58:07 <atul_> simonjb, how to discuss proposal details with you? On IRC only?
2016-03-16T21:58:15 <simonjb> I need to leave soon but will be back online tomorrow morning Eastern time North America

2016-03-16T14:19:37 <Blagoj> Hello all
2016-03-16T14:21:14 <Blagoj> Justin_o: My point on this: https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5877, was when the panel is re-opened, then it gets the applied contrast theme, like it is not consistent all the time
2016-03-16T14:21:54 <Justin_o> Blagoj: yes, it should change when it is reopened, but not while you are interacting with it
2016-03-16T14:23:45 <Justin_o> Blagoj: in regards to your question from yesterday about when you submit your proposal. You must have it submitted during the submission period. When in that period is up to you. The earlier you get it in the more time we\'ll have to review and provide feedback, but I can\'t guarantee that we\'ll have time to look at it right away.
2016-03-16T14:24:05 <Blagoj> Ah okay, I thought it was a strange behaviour.
2016-03-16T14:26:34 <Blagoj> Thanks for the answer, I will do it as soon as I can. I am not in a hurry with the review, but I will submit it in 2-3 days. I would do it right away, but I have exams at university this week.

2016-03-16T14:28:58 <michelled> kasparnet: are you there?
2016-03-16T14:29:12 <kasparnet> michelled: I am
2016-03-16T14:32:55 <michelled> kasparnet: we were just trying to come up with \'standard\' deployments of GPII. cindyli is going to be making some diagrams to show these.
2016-03-16T14:33:09 <michelled> kasparnet: do you have an opinion of what would be standard?
2016-03-16T14:34:52 <kasparnet> so we\'re talking about cloud vs. local components?
2016-03-16T14:35:25 <michelled> yeah, so we thought of 1. hybrid and 2. all in one local (single node instance)
2016-03-16T14:35:34 <michelled> and we are talking about a possible third
2016-03-16T14:36:40 <kasparnet> yeah - at least for C4A, we had a third kind
2016-03-16T14:36:58 <kasparnet> which we called "cloud-based flowmanager" - but which is basically all cloud
2016-03-16T14:37:13 <kasparnet> for implementations that do not have GPII installed on them
2016-03-16T14:37:55 <kasparnet> so eg. the simple java phone, ticket vending machine, android apps that natively install GPII when phones dont
2016-03-16T14:38:09 <kasparnet> michelled, cindyli: ^
2016-03-16T14:38:18 <michelled> thx kasparnet
2016-03-16T14:38:48 <kasparnet> basically, the deployment is everything in the cloud, but cutting away all the lifecycle manager, user listener, etc
2016-03-16T14:39:02 <kasparnet> device reporter, etc
2016-03-16T14:42:56 <kasparnet> michelled, cindyli: just found this in D105.1.4
