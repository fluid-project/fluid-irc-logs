2016-07-14T13:29:03 <jhung> Justin_o: regarding the work on the design guides static site, all the work that needs to be done for the transfer is complete, with the exception of the SVGs in the content lists. dayotte was working on that but is off today and tomorrow. She has work in progress but hasn\'t pushed it up. Should we wait for Monday to finish this, or should I complete the task in my own branch?
2016-07-14T13:29:23 <jhung> maybe michelled you have an opinion? I\'m just thinking about our timing.
2016-07-14T13:29:57 <Justin_o> I\'d lean to you just completing the work, but i\'m happy to defer to michelled\'s opinion
2016-07-14T13:30:16 <michelled> I agree with completeing
2016-07-14T13:30:33 <michelled> or even going live without the SVGs and adding them on Monday
2016-07-14T13:30:47 <jhung> ok Justin_o and michelled. thanks.

2016-07-14T14:43:41 <Justin_o> did you want to talk through it?

2016-07-14T14:46:59 <jhung> done Justin_o. gtirloni the Design Guide site is now in the inclusive-design project space on GitHub. https://github.com/inclusive-design/guide.inclusivedesign.ca

2016-07-14T15:07:01 <jhung> Justin_o: I\'m testing the latest JT demos on Windows NVDA w FF. So far it looks good. Getting all the feedback except for the hand proximity sound.
2016-07-14T15:09:51 <jhung> Justin_o: IE 11 doesn\'t work with the sonification flag. The simulation just doesn\'t load. The webpage goes black after the initial Phet loading screen.
2016-07-14T15:10:29 <Justin_o> jhung: yah, there\'s an error with it in IE because it doesn\'t support some of the audio APIs
2016-07-14T15:11:22 <jhung> The total electrons gets read back twice with NVDA chrome Justin_o
2016-07-14T15:12:03 <Justin_o> jhung: yah in some browser / screen reader combos that happens
2016-07-14T15:12:14 <Justin_o> :( not sure how to fix that yet
2016-07-14T15:12:40 <jhung> Justin_o: perhaps it\'s tolerable.
2016-07-14T15:12:48 <jhung> going to test w JAWS now
2016-07-14T15:13:07 <Justin_o> perhaps... i guess it\'s not ideal though

2016-07-14T15:23:40 <jhung> Justin_o: ok I just tested with JAWS. It works pretty well, except it stalls sometimes on Chrome. Seems like Chrome has the best experience with both JAWS and NVDA currently.
2016-07-14T15:24:02 <Justin_o> are you using a VM too, or native Windows?
2016-07-14T15:24:04 <Justin_o> jhung: ^
2016-07-14T15:24:17 * wannabeCitizen has quit
2016-07-14T15:24:23 <jhung> Also I noticed that instead of the hand proximity sound in FF, there are "tick" sounds instead. I thought that sounded better than the default hand proximity effect Justin_o
2016-07-14T15:24:43 <jhung> native Windows Justin_o
2016-07-14T15:24:57 <Justin_o> jhung: i think that\'s what i was hearing too, but though it might be because of the VM
2016-07-14T15:25:05 <Justin_o> the stalling is unfortunate too
2016-07-14T15:25:12 <Justin_o> i guess there\'s a lot going on there
2016-07-14T15:25:37 <jhung> yeah.
2016-07-14T15:25:37 <sepidehshahi> simonjb, alanharnum, TPark, godfrey_ and Yan_Hu
2016-07-14T15:26:03 <sepidehshahi> we are going to have the Standup meeting at the back since the collab room is occupied for another meeting
2016-07-14T15:26:23 <jhung> So which sim Justin_o should we show on Thursday? I was thinking #2.
2016-07-14T15:26:32 <godfrey_> sepidehshahi: thanks for the headup
2016-07-14T15:26:40 <sepidehshahi> np

2016-07-14T16:37:54 <bens_> colinclark, i\'m at a good point to check in about edgejs, bitness, SPI, killing processes, and unit tests. Its kind of a lot to go over on IRC so I was thinking summary email to the arch list (or is there an APCP list?) then we can discuss.

2016-07-14T16:47:09 <colinclark> The arch list makes sense, bens_
2016-07-14T16:47:17 <colinclark> do you want to chat at some point over skype about it, too?

2016-07-14T16:52:22 <bens_> colinclark, probably best to untangle some of the issues over text first then skype. The short version is that it looks promising so far. This week i\'ve stopped experimenting and actually integrated edge + .net into the windows repo for process killing on 64 bit node.
2016-07-14T16:52:59 <colinclark> that\'s pretty great progress, bens_

2016-07-14T17:16:13 <jhung> I\'m guessing it\'s safe to clean that up a bit? I was going to add some new entries about the sites we run.
2016-07-14T17:22:47 <Justin_o> jhung: yah, should be safe to clean it up
2016-07-14T17:23:43 <Justin_o> jhung: maybe check with gtirloni about point people
