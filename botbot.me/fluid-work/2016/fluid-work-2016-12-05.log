2016-12-05T18:23:55 <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: i\'m going to try to recover the banners that were in our documentation space. I\'m hoping not to break anything along the way but no guarantees. gtirloni made a back up about 20 min ago, which we can restore to if anything horrible happens.

2016-12-05T18:45:40 <sgithens> Do you know if the asteriks head pointer has a solution entry anywhere?
2016-12-05T18:45:52 <sgithens> In their personal github repo, or even somewhere on the internet?
2016-12-05T18:46:26 <sgithens> We want to include it in a hypothetical NP set CIndy and I are making during this team building exercise
2016-12-05T18:46:29 * colinclark has quit
2016-12-05T18:46:29 * colinclark_ is now known as colinclark
2016-12-05T18:47:57 <sgithens> I meant cindyli1
2016-12-05T18:48:05 <simonjb> sgithens: I don\'t know of one :(
2016-12-05T18:48:09 <sgithens> LKJ!
2016-12-05T18:48:33 <sgithens> simonjb: Cool
2016-12-05T18:48:37 * cindyli1 is now known as cindyli
2016-12-05T18:48:40 <sgithens> we\'ll make up a name or something
2016-12-05T18:49:07 <simonjb> sgithens: what does LKJ mean?
2016-12-05T18:49:33 <sgithens> I was just mashing my keyboard in astoundment
2016-12-05T18:49:38 <sgithens> at the lack of solution entry
2016-12-05T18:49:40 <simonjb> ha!
2016-12-05T18:50:07 <simonjb> I thought is was some cutting-edge internet speak
2016-12-05T18:50:33 <sgithens> it is, most definately, a very dull-edged internet speak
2016-12-05T18:50:53 <simonjb> :)
2016-12-05T18:51:21 <sgithens> simonjb
2016-12-05T18:51:27 <sgithens> so the thing from th enexes demo
2016-12-05T18:51:34 <sgithens> the head tracker in software with the webcam
2016-12-05T18:51:42 <sgithens> that was part of the askterik project right?
2016-12-05T18:51:53 <simonjb> yes
2016-12-05T18:53:53 <sgithens> simonjb: I hate to be really lame, but do you happen to have a link to it, or what we would search for
2016-12-05T18:54:01 <sgithens> I keep ending up on the PBX project
2016-12-05T18:54:17 <sgithens> which also has ally options
2016-12-05T18:54:23 <simonjb> sgithens: this is a link to a head tracker mouse model https://github.com/asterics/AsTeRICS/blob/master/bin/ARE/models/CameraMouse.acs
2016-12-05T18:54:27 <sgithens> YES
2016-12-05T18:54:30 <sgithens> thank you!
2016-12-05T18:54:31 <sgithens> :)
2016-12-05T18:54:35 <sgithens> simonjb++
2016-12-05T18:54:46 <simonjb> it\'s not our nexus one but a general mouse model
2016-12-05T18:55:12 <simonjb> sgithens: have you used asterics before?
2016-12-05T18:55:28 <sgithens> not yet
2016-12-05T18:55:40 <sgithens> but I\'ve been meaning to since your legendary toronto demo
2016-12-05T18:56:20 <simonjb> ok, asterics is a general AT-making kit and has a visual programming language
2016-12-05T18:56:28 <simonjb> the programs are called "models"
2016-12-05T18:56:53 <sgithens> mostly I just want to try out the sweet head tracker setup you had on the laptop for the demo
2016-12-05T18:57:05 <sgithens> but I am interested in taking a look through the framework
2016-12-05T18:57:34 <simonjb> here\'s the website: http://www.asterics.eu/
2016-12-05T18:57:35 <sgithens> I doubt during the time of today\'s exercise that\'d have time to write a solutions entry for it
2016-12-05T18:57:39 <sgithens> but you never know!  :)
2016-12-05T18:58:13 <simonjb> I can walk you through using it at some point, if it would be useful
2016-12-05T19:00:10 <sgithens> cool!  I might take you up on that at some point
2016-12-05T19:00:33 <sgithens> It\'s pretty cool stuff that would be great to roll in to my regular demo machine
2016-12-05T19:05:52 <gloob> sgithens: you also have eviacam

2016-12-05T19:08:31 <gloob> I was thinking to onboard it into gpii because open a new AT tool case
2016-12-05T19:08:50 <gloob> we are always thinking of magnifiers, screenreaders etc but not about virtual devices

2016-12-05T20:16:44 <Justin_o> clown: although i\'d say that the "fluid.tests.createSlidingpanel" isn\'t best practice, we\'d typically just create a grade for that now
2016-12-05T20:17:08 <clown> Justin_o:  thanks!
2016-12-05T20:18:34 <Justin_o> clown: in terms of available assertions you can look at https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/tests/test-core/jqUnit/js/jqUnit.js#L125-L194 and https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/tests/test-core/jqUnit/js/jqUnit-browser.js#L38-L53

2016-12-05T15:39:57 <Justin_o> gtirloni: i\'m looking at the Infusion documentation in the fluid wiki
2016-12-05T15:40:06 <Justin_o> https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/docs/Infusion+Documentation
2016-12-05T15:40:11 <Justin_o> https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/Infusion13/Infusion+v1.3+Documentation
2016-12-05T15:40:26 <Justin_o> I\'m pretty sure that anastasia had made these read only and put a banner at the top
2016-12-05T15:40:40 <Justin_o> but those seem to be missing from both of those spaces
2016-12-05T15:40:57 <Justin_o> also I thought we had a 1.4 space as well, but i can\'t seem to see that in the list of spaces
2016-12-05T15:41:03 <Justin_o> any idea where these might have gone
2016-12-05T15:43:36 <Justin_o> it seems our 1.4 documentation was archived
2016-12-05T15:53:46 <gtirloni> Justin_o: i have no idea. do you know who might have archived it?
2016-12-05T15:54:08 <Justin_o> gtirloni: not sure, and i can\'t see a history for that either
2016-12-05T15:54:24 <Justin_o> but that\'s not too big of a deal, we can decide if archiving is what we want even..
2016-12-05T15:54:36 <gtirloni> i found this through google: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/Infusion14/Infusion+v1.4+Documentation
2016-12-05T15:55:10 <Justin_o> i\'m also curious what happened to the banners and permissions for those doc spaces in the wiki
2016-12-05T15:57:36 * lliskovoi joined the channel
2016-12-05T16:00:39 <gtirloni> Justin_o: the pages don\'t show any changes, i think. i think they can make readonly again in taht case
2016-12-05T16:01:01 <gtirloni> Justin_o: the audit log only goes back 1 month (which would show permission changes).. i can\'t see anything in them about these pages
2016-12-05T16:01:27 <the-t-in-rtf1> @amb26 "handlers"
2016-12-05T16:01:51 <Justin_o> gtirloni: hmm, so either something happened further back than that, the change was lost/not recorded, or it never was the case
2016-12-05T16:02:02 <Justin_o> although for at least 1.4 it does seem to be readonly for most users
2016-12-05T16:02:05 <Justin_o> not sure about the other spaces
2016-12-05T16:02:28 <Justin_o> anyways, i think that\'s all okay, or can be fixed easily
2016-12-05T16:02:41 <gtirloni> Justin_o: maybe because we\'re all admins on the site?
2016-12-05T16:02:43 <Justin_o> i\'d like to recover the banner if that\'s possible, i can\'t quite remember what the text of that was, and it had seemed good before
2016-12-05T16:03:03 <gtirloni> Justin_o: the page history seems complete.. if it was changed/added,it should be there
2016-12-05T16:03:24 <Justin_o> gtirloni: that would have likely been a space wide setting, do you know if those are stored in the page history?
2016-12-05T16:03:32 <gtirloni> last change for v1.3 was in 2013
2016-12-05T16:04:37 <gtirloni> unfortunately i don\'t know.. i don\'t know much about confluence\'s user-facing features
2016-12-05T16:05:16 <gtirloni> i guess making them restricted again makes sense, since they seem untouched since 2012/2013
2016-12-05T16:07:45 <gtirloni> Justin_o:
2016-12-05T16:07:46 <gtirloni> https://wiki.fluidproject.org/pages/diffpagesbyversion.action?pageId=2883668&selectedPageVersions=317&selectedPageVersions=311
2016-12-05T16:08:00 <gtirloni> Justin_o: it looks like anastasia removed the banner herself around v311 of that document?

2016-12-05T17:23:35 <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: I think we\'ll skip the planning meeting today. Lots of people are away and we did a two week plan last week.

2016-12-05T17:43:27 <Justin_o> gtirloni: i wonder if this is why we lost the banner, https://confluence.atlassian.com/conf59/configure-the-documentation-theme-792498638.html
2016-12-05T17:44:02 <Justin_o> I\'m speculating here, but i think the one you linked to before used markup directly on the page, and it was likely switched to a space wide banner.
2016-12-05T17:44:25 <Justin_o> I believe the documentation spaces used the documentation theme, which was removed from confluence 6
2016-12-05T17:44:43 <gtirloni> ah that makes sense
2016-12-05T17:45:09 <Justin_o> fortunately it looks like they\'ve added similar functionality to the default theme, so i think i should be able to recreate things once i figure out how to use them
2016-12-05T17:45:31 <Justin_o> gtirloni: do you think we\'d be able to recover the content of the old banner?
2016-12-05T17:46:01 <gtirloni> i\'m not sure, i\'d have to check how to deep dive into the database maybe.. if it\'s somewhere in there
2016-12-05T17:46:12 <gtirloni> was it big? or just a small disclaimer?
2016-12-05T17:47:00 <Justin_o> i think it was a disclaimer similar to the one you linked to, but i don\'t quite remember
2016-12-05T17:47:17 <Justin_o> if it\'s too much trouble, i we could probably just make a new one too

2016-12-05T17:48:09 <gtirloni> this is from before i joined the idrc: https://web.archive.org/web/20150118070545/http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/Infusion13/Infusion+v1.3+Documentation
2016-12-05T17:48:15 <Justin_o> gtirloni: thanks :)
2016-12-05T17:48:38 <Justin_o> gtirloni: also, strange, is that looking at the space tools for the Infusion 1.3 docs, there is a header defined ;(

2016-12-05T17:48:51 <Justin_o> gtirloni: i guess it just doesn\'t work?
2016-12-05T17:49:05 <gtirloni> maybe it depends on a plugin that has been deprecated
2016-12-05T17:49:34 <Justin_o> would they give some warnings for that
2016-12-05T17:49:47 <Justin_o> oh and the header and footer should now be part of the default theme, so i\'d expect it to just work

2016-12-05T17:50:56 <gtirloni> that\'s interesting
2016-12-05T17:51:40 <Justin_o> gtirloni: i was following this https://confluence.atlassian.com/conf59/switch-to-the-default-theme-792498652.html#SwitchtotheDefaultTheme-Edittheheader,footerorcustomsidebarcontent
2016-12-05T17:51:50 <Justin_o> and found that there is wiki markup for the header and sidebar
2016-12-05T17:51:56 <Justin_o> but they seem to be empty when i view the page
2016-12-05T17:53:55 <Justin_o> gtirloni: oh i wonder if the wiki is in a strange state where no theme is actually enabled
2016-12-05T17:54:06 <Justin_o> when i look at the page there are two radio buttons and none of them are checked
2016-12-05T17:54:22 <Justin_o> gtirloni: is this stuff backed up, in case i break something?
2016-12-05T17:55:27 <gtirloni> oh yea, daily.
2016-12-05T17:55:37 <gtirloni> let me take another backup snapshot now to have fresher data
2016-12-05T17:55:39 <Justin_o> gtirloni: that\'s great about the backups.
2016-12-05T17:55:43 <Justin_o> thanks :)
2016-12-05T17:56:05 <Justin_o> let me know when that\'s done, and i\'ll start experimenting.. or if we have a "dev" version of this somewhere that might help
2016-12-05T17:56:14 <Justin_o> also, i was wrong about the theme, it is on the new one

2016-12-05T18:05:06 <gtirloni> Justin_o: no dev instance. backup is completed... be careful though :P (restore is a all-or-nothing operation, if needed)
