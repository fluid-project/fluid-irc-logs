2016-09-21T15:02:16 <Justin_o> gtirloni: i\'m in a branch, but haven\'t changed anything in regards to vagrant, and this happened to me last week too.
2016-09-21T15:02:53 <Justin_o> gtirloni: also you have to start with no vm.. so vagrant destroy first if you have one already

2016-09-21T15:15:15 <gtirloni> `vagrant up` finishes and i never see a warning about the guest additions
2016-09-21T15:15:44 <gtirloni> can i try your branch and see if something could be interfering (besides the vagrant stuff)?

2016-09-21T15:49:17 <gtirloni> Justin_o: i think you might be picking a bad/slow mirror to download packages from. i could reproduce the error on the 1st try here.. but then not anymore (2nd and 3rd tries). does it happen at the idrc network?
2016-09-21T15:49:44 <gtirloni> Justin_o: also, when it finished, i got this error but i think it\'s unrelated: https://www.pastery.net/gbjtyk/
2016-09-21T15:51:36 * alanharnum joined the channel
2016-09-21T15:55:22 <gtirloni> Justin_o: this might be happening because the default timeout for bad mirrors is 120sec.. it\'s too high, imho. i\'ll open a jira to have it changed to something more reasonable (it\'s 30sec on CentOS)
2016-09-21T15:55:57 <Justin_o> gtirloni: thanks.. and i think you caught an error i need to fix with build
2016-09-21T15:56:00 <Justin_o> so i\'ll look into that
2016-09-21T15:56:24 <Justin_o> gtirloni: also i am at the office, is there a way to change which mirrors it connects to?
2016-09-21T16:00:27 <gtirloni> fedora requests a list with the closest mirrors based on your IP, from a central service
2016-09-21T16:00:54 * alanharnum joined the channel
2016-09-21T16:01:23 <gtirloni> it\'s possible to change that... inside the vm you\'d have to edit file /etc/yum.repos.d/fedora-updates.repo (uncomment line 4 and comment line 5)
2016-09-21T16:01:36 <gtirloni> then try `vagrant provision`
2016-09-21T16:02:55 <gtirloni> or edit /etc/dnf/dnf.conf and add the line "timeout=30"
2016-09-21T16:16:53 <Justin_o> gtirloni: would i have to update that every time after i did a vagrant destroy?
2016-09-21T16:17:03 <gtirloni> yes
2016-09-21T16:17:18 <gtirloni> it\'s not an optimal solution. we\'ll add it to a newer version of the box
2016-09-21T16:18:09 <Justin_o> gtirloni: okay, thanks..
2016-09-21T16:20:19 <gtirloni> Justin_o: does it always get stuck for you? or is random? i checked the list of mirrors and it gives 40-50 mirrors for OCAD\'s IP.. so it might be luck
2016-09-21T16:20:57 <Justin_o> gtirloni: i can\'t remember, i\'ll try to destroy and create it again though
2016-09-21T16:32:32 <cindyli> the-t-in-rtf: do you see the comments I added on ur gpii-pouchdb pull request about the good and the bad with the new cleanUp() changes?

2016-09-21T16:35:40 <Bosmon> Thanks for your work on the jQuery upgrade, Justin_o
2016-09-21T16:35:43 <Bosmon> It\'s looking really good
2016-09-21T16:36:00 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks :)
2016-09-21T16:36:18 <Bosmon> I wonder if you had managed to try out any of the tooltip interactions, especially with respect to the pager, since these are by far the most likely to break with a jQuery UI update
2016-09-21T16:46:43 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes, tooltips still work in pager
2016-09-21T16:46:57 <Bosmon> Justin_o - how brilliant and unexpected :)
2016-09-21T16:47:01 <Justin_o> :)
2016-09-21T16:47:17 <Bosmon> Perhaps the jQuery UI tooltip widget simply hasn\'t had any updates
2016-09-21T16:47:28 <Justin_o> i had more trouble getting jQuery sliders to display properly because they changed their markup, but in the end that was a fairly simple fix
2016-09-21T16:47:52 <Justin_o> Bosmon: quite possible
2016-09-21T16:48:17 <Bosmon> Justin_o - it was just a CSS fix? Or something else
2016-09-21T16:48:24 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i\'d actually like to drop jQuery sliders from infusion come the next release, as we likely will have no need for them by then
2016-09-21T16:48:41 <Bosmon> Well, we shouldn\'t drop a successful integration
2016-09-21T16:48:48 <Justin_o> Bosmon: mostly, although i also injected a class to use via their api\'s
2016-09-21T16:48:57 <Bosmon> Personally I find that HTML5 sliders scale their UI very poorly as I zoom the browser
2016-09-21T16:48:59 <Justin_o> Bosmon: sliders aren\'t too useful these days with native ones
2016-09-21T16:49:12 <Justin_o> Bosmon: really..
2016-09-21T16:49:19 <Bosmon> Yes, pixels missing and everything....
2016-09-21T16:49:39 <Justin_o> Bosmon: can you see if you have those issues with these styled versions http://danielstern.ca/range.css/#/
2016-09-21T16:49:44 <Bosmon> Well, an entire boundary missing really, like the right-hand edge
2016-09-21T16:49:56 <Justin_o> Bosmon: or these http://www.cssportal.com/style-input-range/
2016-09-21T16:50:42 <cindyli> the-t-in-rtf: my comments from here onwards: https://github.com/GPII/gpii-pouchdb/pull/12#pullrequestreview-614613, no pressure, just to make sure you are aware.
2016-09-21T16:51:51 <Bosmon> Justin_o - these ones look fine
2016-09-21T16:52:14 <Bosmon> The ones that we have on our build site for the prefs framework look terrible
2016-09-21T16:52:48 <Justin_o> Bosmon: I was thinking we could probably do some better styling for them.
2016-09-21T16:52:54 <Bosmon> Justin_o - cool
2016-09-21T16:53:15 <Justin_o> Bosmon: oh also the next version of UIO will no longer use sliders.. but i suppose we\'ll keep the textfield slider around and can refresh the styling on it
2016-09-21T16:53:28 <Justin_o> next meaning after Infusion 2.0
2016-09-21T16:56:18 <Bosmon> We\'ve got various layout and alignment issues with the prefs framework UI that appear when the browser is zoomed
2016-09-21T16:56:27 <Bosmon> Let me see if any are JIRAed.....
2016-09-21T17:00:30 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks
2016-09-21T17:00:47 <Justin_o> please let me know

2016-09-21T17:02:57 <Bosmon> Who should such issues be assigned to?
2016-09-21T17:03:25 <Bosmon> There\'s also vertical misalignment between the textfield and the slider

2016-09-21T17:37:00 <colinclark> Hey ewbjr, I have a quick question for you
2016-09-21T17:37:32 <ewbjr> colinclark: sure, what\'s up?
2016-09-21T17:38:03 <colinclark> The iOS sample client from Vidyo
2016-09-21T17:38:16 <colinclark> were you ultimately able to get it working\xe2\x80\x94to connect it to our portal and join a call with it?
2016-09-21T17:40:09 <colinclark> ewbjr: ^
2016-09-21T17:41:01 <ewbjr> I was able to login to the portal, but I\'m not sure it joined a call, I can double check this afternoon and get back to ya
2016-09-21T17:43:36 <colinclark> ewbjr: That would be great
2016-09-21T17:43:49 <colinclark> We\'ve run into some issues with our vendor and WebRTC
2016-09-21T17:43:57 <colinclark> I\'m trying to determine how significantly it will impact us
2016-09-21T17:44:12 <colinclark> so I want to know if the state of iOS with our version of Vidyo is seeming doable, as a contingency
