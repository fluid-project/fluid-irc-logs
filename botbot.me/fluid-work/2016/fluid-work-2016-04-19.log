b'2016-04-19T17:38:38 <Bosmon> Please look back at cindyli\'s explanation
2016-04-19T17:39:01 <wale> so this is for local machines sitting in job centers type use case
2016-04-19T17:39:14 <Bosmon> The bearer token doesn\'t contain a random string
2016-04-19T17:39:19 <Bosmon> It contains an encoded form of the preferences
2016-04-19T17:39:19 <wale> someone walks up with a USB stick .. correct
2016-04-19T17:39:32 <wale> encoded ..
2016-04-19T17:39:47 <wale> meaning non sensitive preference set?
2016-04-19T17:39:59 <Bosmon> Not necessarily
2016-04-19T17:40:03 <Bosmon> Why would it mean that?
2016-04-19T17:40:22 <Bosmon> Look, we have been explaining these use cases to you for months :(
2016-04-19T17:40:23 <wale> ok .. please help me understand this use case from end to end
2016-04-19T17:40:25 <Bosmon> Pardon my frustration
2016-04-19T17:41:01 <Bosmon> But it feels like we never get any distance beyond the absolute basics
2016-04-19T17:41:21 <Bosmon> Please could you collectively spend some time to go back over the presentation materials and explanations here in the channel before you ask any further questions?
2016-04-19T17:42:29 <amatas> Jira is back

2016-04-19T20:05:16 <clown> regarding "done":  the packagekit node add-on is done, and you could pull it from my branch.
2016-04-19T20:05:51 <clown> I was going to, in the next hour, change the xrandr add-on to throw an error instead of calling exit().
2016-04-19T20:06:21 <clown> you could (1) wait an hour, or (2) go ahead an pull now, and then pull again when I\'m done with xrandr.
2016-04-19T20:06:33 <clown> what do you want to do, jhernandez?
2016-04-19T20:19:03 <clown> jhernandez: actually, the code change for xrandr will be a little trickier.
2016-04-19T20:19:09 <clown> The current code that uses exit() makes the assumption that nothing needs cleaning up.
2016-04-19T20:19:23 <clown> I need to check what does need cleaning.  This needs a little more finesse.

b'2016-04-19T15:29:33 <kasparnet> let me point you to testcase - sec - need to pastie it
2016-04-19T15:31:48 <kasparnet> cindyli: http://pastebin.com/4JA6PZpy
2016-04-19T15:32:16 <kasparnet> so the question is whether #1 or #2 should be used to give the expected output of line 8-10
2016-04-19T15:32:55 <kasparnet> and when talking with Bosmon about this yesterday, we figured #1 -- but that was partly based on my misunderstanding that that was how the current implementation was
2016-04-19T15:33:59 <cindyli> ah, ok, that explains why i didn\'t find any difference btw #1 and #2
2016-04-19T15:34:41 <cindyli> need to go to a quick meeting, be right back, kasparnet
2016-04-19T15:34:54 * jhernandez has quit
2016-04-19T15:34:57 <cindyli> what\'s the new transformation format then?
2016-04-19T15:35:41 * jhernandez joined the channel
2016-04-19T15:37:10 <kasparnet> cindyli: mostly the same -- line 99-116 in this pad: https://pad.gpii.net/p/valuemapper-transformer-fixup-5na2088
2016-04-19T15:38:10 <kasparnet> cindyli: re: the pastebin -- there *is* a difference between #1 and #2: the inner \'inputPath\' (line 18 and 30)
2016-04-19T15:38:53 <kasparnet> as you can see, example #1 assumes that the outer \'inputPath\' (ie. line 15) is taken into account, whereas #2 assumes it is not
2016-04-19T15:39:17 <kasparnet> So the question would be which ones should produce the output of line 8-10
2016-04-19T15:43:30 <Katy_> cindyli  The  "anonymous/non-cloud use case" deployment, we use a gpii bearer token.  That bearer token the user preferences is encoded in the token. This allows people to use GPII without identifying themselves.  Can this same bearer token be used in the other two deployment for a gpii public workstation or a personal device or is it configured not to be able to be used.
2016-04-19T15:46:47 <Bosmon> kasparnet - yes, seems sort of horrible
2016-04-19T15:47:04 <Bosmon> wale - yes, you may see my response to that email
2016-04-19T15:47:25 <Bosmon> So please do follow up if you have time
2016-04-19T15:47:37 <Bosmon> It would be great to move this into tackling specifics
2016-04-19T15:50:25 <kasparnet> Bosmon: so the question is which one we should use
2016-04-19T15:51:15 <Bosmon> kasparnet - well, I guess our "rule of thumb" is to do whatever anyone first expects
2016-04-19T15:51:26 <kasparnet> I guess there is some indication that if we do consider the inner \'innerPath\' a prefix, we might need to make that clearer
2016-04-19T15:51:31 <Bosmon> kasparnet - yes
2016-04-19T15:51:34 <kasparnet> suffix*
2016-04-19T15:51:46 <Bosmon> Well, might be better to name the outer one a prefix
2016-04-19T15:51:50 <Bosmon> Than naming the inner one a suffix
2016-04-19T15:53:04 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2016-04-19T15:53:08 * yzen joined the channel
2016-04-19T15:53:28 <kasparnet> yeah - I agree, but also sort of disagree :) ... since in a lot of cases (90+ % of all valuemapper transforms I\'ve seen) only the outer "inputPath" is ever used
2016-04-19T15:53:58 <kasparnet> and people are quite familiar with an \'inputPath\' at the outer level
2016-04-19T15:54:02 <kasparnet> from the other transformations
2016-04-19T15:54:36 <kasparnet> but the, "inputPathSuffix" would be a pretty terrible name for the inner one as well
2016-04-19T15:55:01 <kasparnet> could we say "relativeInputPath" for the inner one - or would that be crazy
2016-04-19T15:55:07 <kasparnet> ... yeah, a bit crazy :(
2016-04-19T15:56:00 <kasparnet> Bosmon: ^
2016-04-19T15:56:48 <Bosmon> kasparnet - ok
2016-04-19T15:56:54 <Bosmon> So you propose abolishing the "inputPath" at the inner level?
2016-04-19T15:56:59 <kasparnet> anyway - I\'ll go ahead and implement it with the relative behaviour and hopefully come up with some brilliant naming as I do so
2016-04-19T15:57:26 <kasparnet> well - I did yesterday! But you sort of convinced me that it was useful
2016-04-19T15:57:31 <Bosmon> Well, sure
2016-04-19T15:57:34 <Bosmon> But I might have been wrong
2016-04-19T15:57:50 <Bosmon> We could put this into the same "stealth features" bucket as partialMatches: true
2016-04-19T15:58:01 <Bosmon> That is, document it in a separate area and wait to see if anyone tries to use it
2016-04-19T15:58:05 <kasparnet> haha, perhaps we can have the exact opposite conversation that we did yesterday
2016-04-19T15:58:31 <Bosmon> I think the feature does have some use, but of course it has some cost in complexity and causing confusion
2016-04-19T15:58:56 <Bosmon> Perhaps it would be better to head off the horrible naming conversation if we just stick to the existing behaviour and document it properly
2016-04-19T15:59:06 <Bosmon> At least then it is clear that the two things named "inputPath" do the same thing
2016-04-19T16:00:48 <kasparnet> Bosmon: re: usage, cindyli expressed some desire to use that syntax here: https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5473 (though it\'s not what the JIRA is about)
2016-04-19T16:01:34 <Bosmon> kasparnet - yes, and I think we decided on another JIRA to support this via our new literalValue support
2016-04-19T16:02:14 <Bosmon> Darn, JIRA isn\'t responding any more
2016-04-19T16:02:51 <kasparnet> Bosmon: yeah - I guess... I\'m not particularly excited about that either though, because suddenly one cannot even trust just looking at the outer level to get a sense of what the valuemapper does
2016-04-19T16:03:12 <kasparnet> before one could look at inputPath and say: "oh, this is the part of the input model that is being looked at here"
2016-04-19T16:03:30 <kasparnet> which wouldn\'t be possible if the inner \'inputPath\' overwrites it
2016-04-19T16:03:40 <Bosmon> yes
2016-04-19T16:03:57 <Bosmon> Well, perhaps we can just trash "inner inputPath"
2016-04-19T16:04:12 <Bosmon> Are there other cases where we have options supported within a single match that have the same names as one at the other level?
2016-04-19T16:04:23 <Bosmon> Other than partialMatches that is :)
2016-04-19T16:05:42 <kasparnet> not that I know of
2016-04-19T16:05:51 <cindyli> Katy_: other two cases are cloud based. a main reason that cloud is used in those cases is because user prefs are saved in the cloud. do you have cases that bearer tokens should be used in a cloud backed environment?

2016-04-19T16:12:07 <Bosmon> gtirloni - somehow https://issues.fluidproject.org is timing out for me - does anyone else see this?

2016-04-19T16:13:03 <kasparnet> I\'m happy to scrap it
2016-04-19T16:13:21 <Bosmon> kasparnet - ok then
2016-04-19T16:13:25 <kasparnet> and it _would_ make the value mapper cleaner in it\'s functionality

2016-04-19T17:08:28 <kasparnet> Bosmon: illustrated here: http://pastebin.com/SwivuytM
2016-04-19T17:08:41 <Katy_> Cindyli  I do not have a use case of the bearer token being used in the other two deployment with the cloud. Rather, trying to understand the bearer token a bit more.  If a bearer token can be used to change a public computer where the settings should be from the cloud.   Can it  or does the GPII code not allow it?
2016-04-19T17:08:59 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2016-04-19T17:09:00 <kasparnet> the \'problem\' is that if one can specify individual outputPath\'s, then one needs to be express the individual inverses as well
2016-04-19T17:09:10 <Bosmon> kasparnet - well I did ask you that above :)
2016-04-19T17:09:22 <kasparnet> and I ignored you!
2016-04-19T17:09:23 <kasparnet> :)
2016-04-19T17:09:24 <Bosmon> [17:04] <Bosmon> Are there other cases where we have options supported within a single match that have the same names as one at the other level?
2016-04-19T17:09:30 <Bosmon> Remember that question? : P
2016-04-19T17:10:26 <kasparnet> I refuse to acknowledge that you ever asked that question
2016-04-19T17:10:39 <kasparnet> (disregarding any log files you\'ll send me)
2016-04-19T17:10:52 <kasparnet> things like that can be manipulated
2016-04-19T17:10:59 <Bosmon> Yes
2016-04-19T17:10:59 <Katy_> Bosmon Looks like cindyli is signed off. Perhaps, you can answer my bearer token question when you have a chance.
2016-04-19T17:11:10 <kasparnet> ... no knowing what you\'ve been talking with IDRC about in the backchannel
2016-04-19T17:11:12 <Bosmon> Under kasparnet\'s Stalinist regime
2016-04-19T17:11:40 <Bosmon> Katy_ - the question seems a bit confused! If the settings are on a bearer token, how can they come from the cloud?
2016-04-19T17:11:43 <kasparnet> Bosmon: for example - from michelled (18:03): "Bosmon: avtar and alan are looking into it"
2016-04-19T17:11:57 <kasparnet> who knows whether that was about modifying the log file
2016-04-19T17:12:11 <Bosmon> Anyway, kasparnet - so clearly you would need to get rid of both inputPath and outputPath, if you got rid of one of them
2016-04-19T17:12:22 <kasparnet> yeah, which isn\'t exactly ideal
2016-04-19T17:12:34 <Bosmon> I see, you like outputPath then? : P
2016-04-19T17:12:44 <kasparnet> hahaha, yes
2016-04-19T17:12:46 <Katy_> Bosmon Sorry for the confusing question.  Let me see if I can reword the question better.
2016-04-19T17:12:48 <Bosmon> But somehow you don\'t like inputPath
2016-04-19T17:12:49 <kasparnet> i LOVE outputpath
2016-04-19T17:13:44 <kasparnet> and part of the reason for loving outputPath is that it doesn\'t confuse in the same way inputPath does
2016-04-19T17:13:49 <kasparnet> ... so hence my radical suggestion
2016-04-19T17:14:02 <kasparnet> we rename the outer inputPath -> defaultInputPath
2016-04-19T17:14:12 <kasparnet> (ie. mirroring "defaultOutputPath"
2016-04-19T17:14:13 <kasparnet> )
2016-04-19T17:14:38 <kasparnet> and YES, I realize that 3 days ago, I was arguing defaultInputPath was insane and useless
2016-04-19T17:14:52 <kasparnet> but that was cause it was possible to use in conjunction with inputPath
2016-04-19T17:15:06 * cindyli joined the channel
2016-04-19T17:16:01 <kasparnet> so my radical suggestion: keep (inner) outputPath and (outer) defaultOutputPath, and (inner) inputPath and (outer) defaultOutputPath - where they mirror each other
2016-04-19T17:16:27 <kasparnet> and the functionality is that if an inner is specified, default will be ignored in that case (and vice versa)
2016-04-19T17:16:54 <Katy_> Cindyli Bosmon. The Bearer token is a token that contains the encoded user preference.  It\'s purpose is for the "anonymous/non-cloud use case".  Can this bearer token be used to change any GPII public workstation .
2016-04-19T17:18:08 <cindyli> Katy_: my reply earlier: "Katy_: other two cases are cloud based. a main reason that cloud is used in those cases is because user prefs are saved in the cloud. do you have cases that bearer tokens should be used in a cloud backed environment?"
2016-04-19T17:20:07 <cindyli> Katy_: also, in the environment of GPII public workstations, one thing to avoid is to transmit sensitive info such as users preferences in btw the local and the cloud.
2016-04-19T17:20:08 <Katy_> cindyli.  Understand about the other two cases are cloud based where the settings should be from the cloud. But can this bearer token have the power to change a public workstation.
2016-04-19T17:20:48 <cindyli> Katy_: no
2016-04-19T17:22:38 <Katy_> cindyli   Can you clarify the "no" answer.   For example,  does the GPII code in the public workstation not allow this or doesn\'t recognize a bearer token?
2016-04-19T17:23:44 <cindyli> Katy_: in that deployment structure, a bearer token is not recognized
2016-04-19T17:30:21 <Katy_> cindyli. thank you for the clarification.  I do see the bearer token was not mentioned in the other two deployment. But  I see the word User Listeners and was curious if it was the same code and the bearer token can be recognized and used in a public workstation.
2016-04-19T17:30:54 <Bosmon> Katy_ - the local workstation can be configured how the integrator and deployer responsible wants it to be
2016-04-19T17:31:07 <Bosmon> It is a matter of local policy whether to permit cloud-based preferences, bearer tokens, or both
2016-04-19T17:31:38 <Bosmon> There may be many considerations which affect these choices - for example a bearer token might require a USB drive to be inserted which would violate a local administrative policy
2016-04-19T17:31:51 <Bosmon> or a cloud-based token might require preferences to leave the local device, which violates a different policy
2016-04-19T17:32:12 <Bosmon> It\'s perfectly possible to imagine a local administrator choosing to allow either, or neither
2016-04-19T17:32:32 <Bosmon> kasparnet - that sounds reasonable
2016-04-19T17:32:58 <kasparnet> coolio - I\'ll try it out and then come whining again when there is something new I haven\'t fully thought threw

2016-04-19T17:33:20 <wale> goes without saying that relative to administrative policies the bearer token uses SSL/TLS right?
2016-04-19T17:34:24 <Katy_> Bosmon Thank you for the explaination.  It would be the local administrator fault if he/she allowed a bearer token on the system, when the policy shouldn\'t have.
2016-04-19T17:34:56 <Bosmon> wale - the bearer token is provided on the local machine
2016-04-19T17:35:01 <Bosmon> It never travels over HTTP
2016-04-19T17:35:27 <wale> so it\'s unprotected?
2016-04-19T17:35:37 <Bosmon> wale - unprotected from what?
2016-04-19T17:35:45 <wale> the token
2016-04-19T17:36:07 <Bosmon> wale - the token is unprotected from what?
2016-04-19T17:36:09 <Bosmon> What is your questions?
2016-04-19T17:36:23 <Bosmon> question
2016-04-19T17:38:09 <wale> so my understanding of a typical bearer token is that it contains a random string right?
2016-04-19T17:38:25 <wale> least from a credentialing standpoint
2016-04-19T17:38:33 <Bosmon> wale, I think you have mixed up the use cases

2016-04-19T13:41:48 <Katy_> cindyli Bosmon  This wiki page https://wiki.gpii.net/w/GPII_Deployment_Structures  describes the three deployment use case.  The "Public work stations"  shows the OAuth Server sharing the same node instance as the Cloud Based Flow Manager.  I would like to entertain the idea that the Oauth Server be it\'s own node instance.   The reason being if for some reason in the future we decide it is necessary or to use a commerical authentic
2016-04-19T13:42:21 <Katy_> Can you describe the GPII code and configuration files that need to be change to accomodate that idea.
2016-04-19T13:46:15 <cindyli> Katy_: i totally agree that "the Oauth Server be it\'s own node instance". that is one task on the "security plan" wiki page, i\'m digging the code that needs to be changed. one sec
2016-04-19T13:50:25 <cindyli> Katy_: the code where currently the auth server is used as a subcomponent of the cloud flow manager - https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/src/CloudBasedFlowManager.js#L113
2016-04-19T13:50:39 <Bosmon> cindyli, Katy_ - we\'ve worked hard to ensure that the GPII is agnostic with respect to co-location of different services, whether they are deployed locally or remotely
2016-04-19T13:50:55 <Bosmon> So having the OAuth server as a separate instance is certainly a *possible* configuration of the GPII
2016-04-19T13:51:07 <Bosmon> But we\'d worry if a technology choice had forced us to deploy this way
2016-04-19T13:51:08 * colinclark joined the channel
2016-04-19T13:51:31 <Bosmon> That is, we\'d have to be clear about what we were gaining from the choice, in order to compensate for the loss of flexibility
2016-04-19T13:51:56 <Bosmon> Do you have an idea what a "commercial oauth server" might offer us above what we have currently, and an idea about which one we\'d choose?
2016-04-19T13:52:14 <colinclark> Katy_, Bosmon: I worry a lot about the "kitchen sink" architecture of most commercial authorization servers these days
2016-04-19T13:52:26 <Katy_> Bosmon Yes, I agree it looks like GPII is scaleable and flexible .  But was curious what it would take to switch the authentication server. What code and configuration file.
2016-04-19T13:52:46 <colinclark> they invariably offer so many features, which is itself a risk in terms of supporting, securing, updating, etc.
2016-04-19T13:53:05 <colinclark> we really need to be very clear about which features we actually need, and why
2016-04-19T13:55:28 * alanharnum joined the channel
2016-04-19T13:57:02 <Bosmon> Hi Katy_ - here is the relevant distribution: https://github.com/amb26/universal/blob/GPII-1318/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/configs/gpii.flowManager.cloudBased.config.development.json#L7
2016-04-19T13:57:10 <Bosmon> cindyli ^
2016-04-19T13:57:30 <cindyli> thanks, Bosmon
2016-04-19T13:57:37 <Bosmon> Overriding this can be done from the top-level driver
2016-04-19T13:57:57 <Katy_> There are definite pros using a commercial authentication server and I\'m sure pros in creating your own.    1) Can our development team create a reliable authentication service as good as team who specializes in oauth2 server.
2016-04-19T13:58:23 <Katy_> 2) Can our development team do it cheaper than buying those services if you total all the costs over the life of the app(s)
2016-04-19T13:58:32 <Bosmon> The pros are only as good as our ability to evaluate the pros :)
2016-04-19T13:58:46 <Katy_> 3) Do we want to have to always worry about the newest securilty hacks and vulnerabilities.
2016-04-19T13:58:47 <Bosmon> What we want IBM to help us with is the ability to evaluate an Oauth implementation for its quality
2016-04-19T13:59:06 <Bosmon> Rather than to make technology choices for us : P
2016-04-19T13:59:28 <Bosmon> If we have hard criteria for evaluating how good our choices are, then our choices are obvious
2016-04-19T13:59:48 <Bosmon> That is, for example, a test suite which can test against various penetration risks and attack strategies
2016-04-19T13:59:58 <Bosmon> Or a code review which checks for these risks
2016-04-19T14:00:06 <Bosmon> Everything else is just hearsay
2016-04-19T14:00:22 <Bosmon> We\'re not going to buy something from someone just on the basis that "they specialise in writing oauth2 servers" : P
2016-04-19T14:00:27 <Bosmon> We need to see the evidence for ourselves
2016-04-19T14:00:42 <colinclark> Katy_: In my mind, it\'s not really a binary: off the shelf or creating our own, but rather finding out which tools are most appropriate for assembing something that works best for us. Even an off the shelf server will have to be adapted and developed upon. So I don\'t think anyone\'s really thinking of writing something from scratch, but finding the best libraries to develop with for our needs.
2016-04-19T14:05:38 <Bosmon> The choice of oauth server could be overridden by a distribution added at this point in the main driver file: https://github.com/amb26/universal/blob/GPII-1318/gpii/configs/cloudBased.development.all.local.json#L10
2016-04-19T14:06:05 <Katy_> colinclark Bosmon  agree.  Do we have documentation that shows how established oauth2arize?  Testimonies from companies where its "live" app are successfully using oauth2arize with large public usage.
2016-04-19T14:06:31 * Awesome_A joined the channel
2016-04-19T14:06:32 <cindyli> Katy_: actually, looking at the code and configuration, the auth server is already able to be deployed as its own node instance, there\'s not much code change needed. I will double with simon on that
2016-04-19T14:06:36 <Bosmon> Katy_ - well, we have the testimony of StrongLoops\'s own customers :)
2016-04-19T14:06:50 <Bosmon> Since StrongLoop relies on a modified version of oauth2orize for its own Oauth2 workflow
2016-04-19T14:07:00 <Awesome_A> Hi everyone!
2016-04-19T14:07:10 <Bosmon> Unfortunately they have forked it sufficiently that it can\'t be merged back again with the main community version....
2016-04-19T14:08:50 <colinclark> Katy_: I\'d also hope we\'re all, as a team, dedicated to seeing through the marketing materials--the testimonials and the like--and looking at the techincal merits and community strength of a particular tool.
2016-04-19T14:09:01 <Katy_> Bosmon  Very good point regarding Strongloop using oauth2orize, but sounds like it has its own forked version of oauth2orize.

2016-04-19T14:30:43 <wale> I get the premise of building a lean oauth AS with features you need
2016-04-19T14:32:10 * Awesome_A has quit
2016-04-19T14:32:33 <wale> "<Bosmon> What we want IBM to help us with is the ability to evaluate an Oauth implementation for its quality"
2016-04-19T14:33:03 <wale> this exercise is particularly tricky .. I say that with a grain of salt
2016-04-19T14:33:41 <wale> when you consider the pool of brilliant minds that gave us oauth 1 only to realize later it had gapping holes in it
2016-04-19T14:35:21 <Bosmon> It\'s certainly at tricky exercise :)
2016-04-19T14:35:31 <Bosmon> But it\'s what we need...
2016-04-19T14:35:43 <Bosmon> How do we know what needs are being met, unless we can evaluate them?
2016-04-19T14:36:37 <wale> absolutely .. the evaluation effort I suppose is what we need in order to arrive at an educated decision/path
2016-04-19T14:36:46 <Bosmon> Especially, since as we often see, the GPII is a different kind of project to traditional software deployments
2016-04-19T14:37:01 <Bosmon> We need extra confidence that the problem that the "brilliant minds" have been solving is the same one that we want solved
2016-04-19T14:37:31 <wale> except it took years to discover the vulnerability
2016-04-19T14:37:49 <wale> with a massive pool of eyes looking at it
2016-04-19T14:38:12 <colinclark> I like the way you\'ve summarized the core architectural criteria, wale! "a lean oauth AS with features you need"
2016-04-19T14:38:15 <wale> but we\'d give it a go
2016-04-19T14:39:56 <wale> it\'s a novel idea .. at least that\'s what I gleaned from the gist this morning
2016-04-19T14:39:59 <Bosmon> I\'m not sure that this actually was the story whereby OAuth 2 was derived from OAuth 1 - I believe that OAuth 2 came about not because of vulnerabilities in OAuth 1, but because OAuth 1 wasn\'t flexible enough to address the wide class of needs that people had
2016-04-19T14:40:10 <wale> it doesn\'t however equates to less vulnerability
2016-04-19T14:40:21 <Bosmon> OAuth1 does have vulnerabilities such a session fixation attack, but OAuth 2 has at least as many vulnerabilities and more on top
2016-04-19T14:40:30 <Bosmon> Which is why we need to be absolutely clear that we understand our threat model
2016-04-19T14:41:09 <Bosmon> Preferably, backed up by actual test cases which attempt to penetrate the system
2016-04-19T14:41:36 <wale> Bosmon .. 1.a was rolled out to address gap security holes
2016-04-19T14:43:18 <Bosmon> Here\'s a useful guide to some threats, for example, and an "elaborated" OAuth2 workflow: http://www.oauthsecurity.com/
2016-04-19T14:43:42 <Bosmon> THe question is - how can we be sure that either our own implementation, or a commercial provider, defends against these same threats?
2016-04-19T14:44:26 <Bosmon> It\'s not enough to say that "they are brilliant" or "they specialize in doing this for a living" - we actually need to check it :)
2016-04-19T14:44:53 <Bosmon> Would you buy a used car from a man who said "I do this for a living"? : P
2016-04-19T14:45:15 <colinclark> ha!
2016-04-19T14:45:26 <colinclark> Buying cars terrifies me
2016-04-19T14:46:42 <wale> building cars is scarier
2016-04-19T14:47:11 <Bosmon> When I bought my car, I called in an independent expert who checked it over, and could at least tell me that there weren\'t any number of obvious things wrong with it
2016-04-19T14:47:24 <Bosmon> What we\'d like is for IBM to be our "independent expert" in this role ...
2016-04-19T14:48:52 <Bosmon> http://www.rac.co.uk/buying-a-car/vehicle-inspections/advanced-inspection
2016-04-19T14:49:08 <Bosmon> Where the crucial point is that they actually take the car itself for a ride and check it out ....
2016-04-19T14:51:38 * Awesome_A joined the channel
2016-04-19T14:57:01 <wale> Bosmon .. I\'m confident that we can satisfy the position of being an independent expert. The caveat however is, consistent with security principles, the threat model we identify and solve for now will require a constant stage of vigilance to the changing threat landscape
2016-04-19T14:57:23 <wale> *state of vigilance
2016-04-19T14:58:00 <wale> so I think we mentioned code reviews and checks etc at some point
2016-04-19T15:00:30 * gloob joined the channel
2016-04-19T15:00:30 <wale> stressing the fact that beyond the initial development efforts we\'d have to continue assessing and solution for continuous monitoring
2016-04-19T15:04:40 <Bosmon> wale - absolutely
2016-04-19T15:05:23 <Bosmon> So it would be great to be able to begin our state of vigilance now, and start building up a test set of vulnerabilities we\'d like to check for
2016-04-19T15:08:22 <wale> I believe we started that conversation in a digest message I responded to about 3 weeks ago
2016-04-19T15:08:30 <wale> gotta dig it up ..
2016-04-19T15:08:47 <wale> this was in response to the npm outage with package dependencies
2016-04-19T15:09:08 <wale> checking for OWASP being an item
2016-04-19T15:17:54 <wale> Short of employing OWASP basics, perhaps as a Band-Aid (temporary) measure, we should consider a static code analysis function where we import code from Git and scan accordingly (assuming we have an engine). It\xe2\x80\x99s albeit temporary since static code scans are not adequately able to identify many vulnerabilities found in open code, they basically only provide a point in time snapshot of threats let alone mitigating zero-day threats. D
2016-04-19T15:18:46 <wale> assuming you have a APT threat feed in place. In addition to the security advisory channels, mailing lists etc that we\'re looking at, I\xe2\x80\x99d suggest the NVD database for advisories but that only captures something to the tune of 15% of threats out there.
2016-04-19T15:18:55 <wale> Agree with Gio that there aren\xe2\x80\x99t too many options for services that offer effective identification of code exposures and associated GPII component dependencies, where exploits are quickly patched, remediated, taken offline etc
2016-04-19T15:19:02 <wale> Appears this comes down to plenty of grunt work. Happy to be engaged as we continue to solution for GPII controls and putting in some semblance of governance on our development practices.
2016-04-19T15:19:12 <wale> that was my response about a month ago
2016-04-19T15:19:31 <wale> so essentially, in order to do this, we have to continue along this path
2016-04-19T15:20:49 <kasparnet> Bosmon: : So i looked into the horrors of the \'inputPath\' for the valueMapper a bit more
2016-04-19T15:21:27 <kasparnet> Bosmon: and it seems that the previous implementation actually had the inner \'inputPath\' *overwrite* the value of the outer \'inputPath\'
2016-04-19T15:21:47 <kasparnet> instead of making them accumulative as we talked about yesterday
2016-04-19T15:21:59 <kasparnet> dont know if you have any opinion on the desired behavior
2016-04-19T15:22:14 <kasparnet> (or if cindyli does, for that matter)

2016-04-19T15:28:17 <cindyli> kasparnet: do you have a test case that shows this horror of the overwriting? need to understand what is happening now and what is the desired output.

2016-04-19T15:29:01 <kasparnet> Well, I\'m in the midst of a bigger rewrite of the valueMapper (https://pad.gpii.net/p/valuemapper-transformer-fixup-5na2088)
