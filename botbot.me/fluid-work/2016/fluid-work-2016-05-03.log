b"2016-05-03T15:16:05 <dins> but, when there is a list of items having mostly the same behavior, it's a good idea to generalize it than wring sequences for each and every item.....
2016-05-03T15:16:57 <dins> even before my change, it had the same implementation, and I did modify it accordingly
2016-05-03T15:17:15 <dins> to extend it further
2016-05-03T15:17:18 <dins> :)
2016-05-03T15:18:21 <dins> but, what you said is correct, we need to improve the readability. So, we can improve comments
2016-05-03T15:18:30 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2016-05-03T15:23:01 <dins> anyway, cindyli : still I think we should have it generalized like this rather than having repeated the same code again and again.... which was the old implementation too
2016-05-03T15:23:32 <cindyli> i agree on not to repeat the code :)
2016-05-03T15:23:51 <dins> ok
2016-05-03T15:24:02 <dins> then I'l improve comments
2016-05-03T15:24:16 <dins> to make it more readable to others
2016-05-03T15:24:45 <dins> cindyli: are u good with this?
2016-05-03T15:27:25 <cindyli> dins: i will be able to answer this question shortly. :) reading more into ur code
2016-05-03T15:27:42 <dins> sure cindyli

2016-05-03T12:49:56 <Bosmon> Hi there cindyli - yet another one for you :)
2016-05-03T12:49:57 <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/708/files
2016-05-03T12:51:42 * michelled joined the channel
2016-05-03T12:51:56 <cindyli> sure, Bosmon
2016-05-03T12:52:10 <Bosmon> cindyli - cheers :)
2016-05-03T12:53:09 * wale joined the channel
2016-05-03T12:56:29 <cindyli> Bosmon: in terms of the issue with deploying infusion-docs to the live site, jhung had an article of how to push /out directory as a subtree to the gh-pages branch - https://gist.github.com/cobyism/4730490
2016-05-03T12:56:49 <cindyli> the first step is to remove the /out folder from .gitignore
2016-05-03T12:57:09 <Bosmon> cindyli - I wanted to mention that we need to rewrite this workflow anyway
2016-05-03T12:57:19 * jessm joined the channel
2016-05-03T12:57:21 <Bosmon> Given our plan is to be able to deploy multiple different versioned copies of the docs
2016-05-03T12:57:42 <cindyli> multiple different versioned copies?
2016-05-03T12:57:54 <Bosmon> When we make the Infusion 2.0.0 release for example, we will want to have docs permanently deployed to http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/2.0.0/
2016-05-03T12:57:54 <cindyli> why
2016-05-03T12:57:58 <Bosmon> BECAUSE OF THIS!
2016-05-03T12:58:01 <cindyli> ok, i see
2016-05-03T12:58:12 <Bosmon> So our gh-deploy workflow will become more complex
2016-05-03T12:58:13 * jhung1 joined the channel
2016-05-03T12:58:30 <Bosmon> We will need to check out the existing branch, copy to just one directory of it, commit it, delete the remote branch and then regenerate it
2016-05-03T12:58:53 <Bosmon> Which I think is well beyond the abilities of the gh-deploy plugin
2016-05-03T12:59:03 * jhung has quit
2016-05-03T13:00:05 * anvk joined the channel
2016-05-03T13:00:11 <Bosmon> The "cobyism" article is helpful in principle, but in practice we need a portable script
2016-05-03T13:01:19 <cindyli> that\'s true
2016-05-03T13:01:49 <Bosmon> It might be worth introducing grunt into this project
2016-05-03T13:01:57 <Bosmon> Given I guess we seem to be stuck with it across our architecture
2016-05-03T13:02:00 <cindyli> ya, thinking about grunt too
2016-05-03T13:02:14 <Bosmon> At least it has builtin primitives for copying directory subtrees etc.
2016-05-03T13:02:29 <cindyli> oh, good to know
2016-05-03T13:03:25 <Bosmon> Even if they are abominably hard to use
2016-05-03T13:03:30 <cindyli> i will improve the jira to include this version support feature
2016-05-03T13:03:39 <Bosmon> cindyli - thanks
2016-05-03T13:03:50 <Bosmon> It was something we always intended to have, but given we didn\'t have Infusion releases, it wasn\'t a huge priority
2016-05-03T13:03:59 <Bosmon> But I imagine the release will go out this month
2016-05-03T13:04:32 * jhung1 is now known as jhung
2016-05-03T13:04:40 <Bosmon> cindyli - here is an example of a "manual grunt copy task" which I wrote, with great trouble
2016-05-03T13:04:41 <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-studios/infusion-onward-video-example/blob/master/Gruntfile.js#L30
2016-05-03T13:05:12 <cindyli> nice. thanks, Bosmon
2016-05-03T13:05:37 <Bosmon> It\'s simple enough, once you abandon trying to use their pitiful attempts to provide declarative configuration : P
2016-05-03T13:06:22 <Bosmon> And another side-note, it is about time we began our community-wide efforts to move up to grunt 1.0
2016-05-03T13:07:35 <cindyli> Bosmon: do you think if it\'s worth to first fix the live site deployment issue by renaming decopod-config.js to decopod.js, then working on the grunt manual pushes when we, you or me or someone else, have more time
2016-05-03T13:07:58 <Bosmon> cindyli - we can just go back to the old instructions in the README and remove that one task
2016-05-03T13:08:02 <Bosmon> Oh
2016-05-03T13:08:04 <Bosmon> I guess we can\'t
2016-05-03T13:08:13 <Bosmon> Fine....
2016-05-03T13:09:02 <Bosmon> As ANOTHER side note, node 6.0 was released last week - but it will not become the LTS version until October, so we have a while to get used to it
2016-05-03T13:09:15 * simonjb joined the channel
2016-05-03T13:09:21 <cindyli> good to know
2016-05-03T13:09:56 <cindyli> what do you mean "we can\'t"? cannot go back to the old instructions?
2016-05-03T13:10:12 <Bosmon> cindyli - I meant we can\'t back out part of the changes, we have to back out all of them :(
2016-05-03T13:10:30 <cindyli> that\'s true, for both local and live site deployment

2016-05-03T15:00:34 <dins> the list of sequences
2016-05-03T15:00:44 <dins> it is generated dynamically
2016-05-03T15:00:57 <dins> which also reduce the number of lines in the code
2016-05-03T15:01:08 <cindyli> where do you reuse the list of sequences?
2016-05-03T15:01:08 <kasparne_> jhernandez, Bosmon, colinclark: we got a meeting now

2016-05-03T15:01:27 <colinclark> ok
2016-05-03T15:01:58 <dins> I got the use of it to verify whether tool-tips are synced wen the page size is changed
2016-05-03T15:02:56 <cindyli> dins: do u mean adding that verification into the same "sequence" variable?
2016-05-03T15:03:15 <jhernandez> kasparne_: on my way
2016-05-03T15:03:42 <cindyli> dins: i don\'t see this sequence gets used more than once
2016-05-03T15:04:00 <dins> can u see the comment I have pu in the code "Change the page size and verify whether the tooltips are synced accordingly"
2016-05-03T15:04:24 <dins> under that I have called the same method with the input 2,3,4 seperately
2016-05-03T15:05:53 <dins> that is to change the page size and veriyfy tool-tips
2016-05-03T15:06:06 <dins> so, that where I reused that
2016-05-03T15:07:01 <cindyli> ok, i see. but as said in the comment, first, i don\'t think you need to push more into the "sequence" to reuse this function. "sequence" is meant for the IoC testing
2016-05-03T15:07:26 <cindyli> it can be simplified by using jqunit.test()
2016-05-03T15:07:50 <dins> it\'s not more actually.... the list of pager links displaying
2016-05-03T15:08:11 <dins> which is a like a static number of links
2016-05-03T15:08:15 <cindyli> second, please take a look on the IoC testing example I added to ur comment, which is the desired way of defining IoC test sequence
2016-05-03T15:09:20 <dins> sure cindyli
2016-05-03T15:11:41 <dins> but, still I feel like it\'s the same implementation
2016-05-03T15:11:47 <dins> in a different manner
2016-05-03T15:12:02 <dins> where the list of sequences are generated by the code
2016-05-03T15:12:24 <dins> I\'l have a look again
2016-05-03T15:12:26 <dins> :)
2016-05-03T15:13:22 <cindyli> dins: i totally agree with you. but we should consider the readability and how easy for other ppl to maintain the code whenever possible
2016-05-03T15:13:52 <cindyli> i agree there are certainly cases where the sequence needs to be dynamically generated
2016-05-03T15:14:23 <cindyli> however, we only do that when it\'s not possible or not efficient to declare a static test sequence
