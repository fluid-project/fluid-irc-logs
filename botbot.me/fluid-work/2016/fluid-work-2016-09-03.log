2016-09-03T22:33:40 <cindyli> hi Bosmon
2016-09-03T22:34:12 <Bosmon> Hi there cindyli -
2016-09-03T22:34:15 <Bosmon> You\'re very industrious :)
2016-09-03T22:34:30 <cindyli> yay, saw ur pull request comments. i\'m lucky :)
2016-09-03T22:34:59 <cindyli> writing a function to programatically add event listeners and remove afterwards - http://pastebin.com/tMd8gUsd
2016-09-03T22:35:13 <Bosmon> cindyli - it\'s terrible!
2016-09-03T22:35:21 <Bosmon> Such code must never be written
2016-09-03T22:35:31 <cindyli> what\'s the proper way?
2016-09-03T22:35:42 <Bosmon> We write listeners declaratively
2016-09-03T22:35:44 <Bosmon> I think you remember :)_
2016-09-03T22:36:31 <cindyli> started with those first but hitting problems at writing unit tests because i have a listener for afterDestroy, which will recreate the pouch harness
2016-09-03T22:36:45 <cindyli> so in unit tests, the pouch would never be destroyed
2016-09-03T22:36:53 <cindyli> and cleaned up
2016-09-03T22:37:26 <Bosmon> I see
2016-09-03T22:37:30 <cindyli> so, i switched to use dynamic ones so those listeners are only hooked up in the reset() function
2016-09-03T22:38:06 <Bosmon> I guess an afterDestroy listener that recreates the same component is going to be just as much as hazard in real life as in the test cases
2016-09-03T22:38:19 <cindyli> certainly true
2016-09-03T22:40:32 <Bosmon> I suggest you record the fact that the component is to be recreated on the next destroy by setting a flag such as "recreateAfterDestroy" on the component during the action where you know this is to be required
2016-09-03T22:40:38 * kavya has quit
2016-09-03T22:40:49 <Bosmon> And then just have a standard declarative afterDestroy listener which always acts, and checks the flag
2016-09-03T22:41:57 <cindyli> sounds like a good idea. trying
