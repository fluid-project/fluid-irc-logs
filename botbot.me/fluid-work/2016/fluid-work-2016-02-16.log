b'2016-02-16T19:33:49 <simonjb> :)
2016-02-16T19:34:42 <colinclark> I also hope our GSoC projects will get picked up by keen students
2016-02-16T19:35:07 <colinclark> I wrote up two: one to create a working SoundFont parser and synthesis engine, and another to create accessible "music UI controls"
2016-02-16T19:36:05 <colinclark> michelled and simonjb: shall I go ahead and chop 6-8, then?
2016-02-16T19:36:16 <colinclark> and then you should be good to go, simonjb
2016-02-16T19:36:22 <colinclark> is there anything else presentation-wise that I can help with?
2016-02-16T19:38:11 <simonjb> I think we are good -- I\'m getting an embedded font error when I open avtar\'s slides in PowerPoint 2010 but it seems like it\'s ignorable -- either maybe the font isn\'t being used or PowerPoint is substituting -- I don\'t see obvious problems
2016-02-16T19:39:03 <simonjb> not sure where it\'s coming from if it\'s a Google Docs font -- PT Sans and PT Sans Bold
2016-02-16T19:39:28 <michelled> sounds good colinclark
2016-02-16T19:40:32 <simonjb> michelled: could you make a pptx file and mail to me?
2016-02-16T19:41:07 <simonjb> I\'ll then upload our 3 presentations for Till
2016-02-16T19:41:31 <simonjb> https://sites.google.com/a/raisingthefloor.org/p4amanage/2nd-annual-plenary-meeting-in-stuttgart/agenda-1/sp2-pitches
2016-02-16T19:42:28 <avtar> simonjb: the odd thing is that the font in the original template, as reported by google docs, was calibri
2016-02-16T19:43:22 <avtar> i don\'t see pt sans in the document itself so maybe it\'s being substituted during the export process?
2016-02-16T19:43:41 * clown joined the channel
2016-02-16T19:43:59 <simonjb> maybe google docs is using pt sans in place of calibri
2016-02-16T19:44:05 * clown is now known as Guest32015
2016-02-16T19:44:05 <colinclark> simonjb: I think the key with presenting our work on Infusion is to highlight that we are being responsive to user feedback
2016-02-16T19:44:28 <colinclark> in terms of improving the documentation first, and now with our early inspector tool
2016-02-16T19:44:34 <colinclark> If need be, are you set up to demonstrate that?
2016-02-16T19:45:25 <simonjb> no, I\'m not -- is there an easily accessible test page I could use and have a poke at it
2016-02-16T19:45:28 <colinclark> http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/uiOptions/
2016-02-16T19:45:31 <simonjb> colinclark ^
2016-02-16T19:45:37 <colinclark> There\'s a little geared wheel in the bottom right corner
2016-02-16T19:45:46 <simonjb> excellent, thanks
2016-02-16T19:45:51 <colinclark> if you open it, a panel will be displayed
2016-02-16T19:45:59 <colinclark> and there is a magnifying glass
2016-02-16T19:46:17 <colinclark> which, when activated, will let you hover over any "component" on the page and see information about it
2016-02-16T19:46:25 <colinclark> such as what grades it is composed of
2016-02-16T19:46:41 <colinclark> even line numbers into files where it was defined and, presumably, instantiated
2016-02-16T19:47:07 <colinclark> hovering over these file references even appear to show the defaults block in question
2016-02-16T19:47:31 <colinclark> it really is quite cool, isn\'t it Bosmon?
2016-02-16T19:49:20 <simonjb> ok, cool, thanks, glad you brought that up
2016-02-16T19:49:42 <Bosmon> It is somewhat cool : P
2016-02-16T19:49:47 <Bosmon> If only it were more "deliverable"
2016-02-16T19:49:57 <Bosmon> As I try to insist to my colleage PETTRICHECK....
2016-02-16T19:50:06 <Bosmon> Software is not worth anything if it cannot be delivered to the point of use
2016-02-16T19:50:49 <simonjb> Can I hover over a component in the page that then \'freeze\' the lower panel so that I can hover over the line numbers?
2016-02-16T19:51:01 <Bosmon> simonjb - yes
2016-02-16T19:51:08 <Bosmon> If you click on the component, it will freeze
2016-02-16T19:51:40 <Bosmon> The semi-opaque highlight also absorbs mouse clicks
2016-02-16T19:51:42 <Bosmon> "mostly" : P
2016-02-16T19:51:45 <simonjb> ah, I see, but also pass the click on
2016-02-16T19:51:48 <Bosmon> Yes
2016-02-16T19:51:58 <Bosmon> It was an interaction problem I couldn\'t find a clear way to solve
2016-02-16T19:52:13 <Bosmon> This is something that could probably also be remedied with the escalated permissions available from a browser plugin
2016-02-16T19:52:22 <simonjb> got it -- I was experimenting with the overview panel and it keeps expanding and collapsing :)
2016-02-16T19:52:26 <Bosmon> Yes
2016-02-16T19:52:37 <Bosmon> Just click on an otherwise innocuous area for the demo :)
2016-02-16T19:52:43 <colinclark> hahaha
2016-02-16T19:52:54 <Bosmon> Windows users are used to this anyway
2016-02-16T19:52:55 <colinclark> we\'ll put some cycles into converting this into a Chrome Dev Tools extension
2016-02-16T19:53:00 <colinclark> and IT WILL BE AWESOME
2016-02-16T19:53:23 <Bosmon> It\'s funny how peculiar this "click on unoccupied space" idiom is, and how hard it is to convey it to a hardened Mac user : P
2016-02-16T19:53:24 <simonjb> yeah, this is definitely very nice
2016-02-16T19:53:43 <Bosmon> Rachael is always lost until I remind her that most functions on Windows are accessed by "right-clicking on some empty area"
2016-02-16T19:55:14 <Bosmon> I can\'t actually remember what the interaction issue was, but vague memories that it might be related to constructing the DOM elements on a mousemove event that are meant to then not self-react
2016-02-16T19:55:16 <Bosmon> Oh yes, that was it
2016-02-16T19:55:32 <Bosmon> It\'s the fact that the mouseevents: none style in CSS doesn\'t allow you to filter by the type of event
2016-02-16T19:55:37 <Bosmon> Either you get all of them or you get none
2016-02-16T19:56:10 <Bosmon> So you either fail to get mousemove events delivered, or you become unclickable

2016-02-16T20:11:12 <simonjb> Nexus, Quality Infrastructure, and Web Building Blocks
2016-02-16T20:11:12 <michelled> thx simonjb
2016-02-16T20:11:27 <simonjb> could you 3 do a quick check for me?
2016-02-16T20:11:55 <simonjb> I found that if I resaved your pptx files from PowerPoint, it got rid of the font embed error
2016-02-16T20:12:07 <simonjb> avtar, michelled, Bosmon ^
2016-02-16T20:12:33 <simonjb> maybe open each of the 3 files and verify no obvious problems
2016-02-16T20:12:40 <simonjb> then I\'ll go to bed :)

2016-02-16T16:03:09 <simonjb> hey Bosmon, colinclark, michelled, avtar: on IRC with IRCCloud
2016-02-16T16:03:17 <avtar> hey simonjb
2016-02-16T16:03:19 <colinclark> simonjb: you made it!
2016-02-16T16:06:05 <simonjb> Bosmon: when would work for you to chat about the slides?
2016-02-16T16:07:29 <Bosmon> Hey there simonjb
2016-02-16T16:07:44 <Bosmon> They look very good
2016-02-16T16:07:50 <Bosmon> I have only a few minor tweak ideas at present
2016-02-16T16:07:57 <simonjb> ok, that\'s great
2016-02-16T16:08:09 <simonjb> thanks for looking them over
2016-02-16T16:08:42 <Bosmon> I was thinking for bullet point 1 on slide to say "component-bound model state" rather than "component model state".... although this may not be any more intelligible to any particular audience
2016-02-16T16:09:01 <Bosmon> And for bullet point 2 to say "Components and external observers" may receive streams of changes
2016-02-16T16:09:12 <simonjb> this is slide #4?
2016-02-16T16:09:14 <Bosmon> Yes
2016-02-16T16:09:17 <simonjb> cool
2016-02-16T16:09:24 <Bosmon> Sorry I missed out the number 4, which would have been helpful :)
2016-02-16T16:09:34 <simonjb> :)
2016-02-16T16:09:46 <Bosmon> Then on slide 5 I think some kind of "arrow" is necessary to show that the model peers are in some kind of relay relationship
2016-02-16T16:10:09 <simonjb> yes, good idea
2016-02-16T16:12:09 <michelled> Bosmon: are you available to talk to Javi and me about the architecture diagram for APCP?
2016-02-16T16:12:55 <Bosmon> simonjb - also, I think it\'s important to state that a request to the Nexus can be used to set up or tear down a relationship between two previously registered components
2016-02-16T16:13:21 <Bosmon> That is, it\'s not just capable of i) registering or unregistering things, or ii) listening for changes to them
2016-02-16T16:13:44 <Bosmon> michelled - sure
2016-02-16T16:13:46 <simonjb> yeah, that\'s worth noting, thanks
2016-02-16T16:14:12 <michelled> Bosmon: would nowish work? or would it be better to meet tomorrow morning?
2016-02-16T16:14:30 <Bosmon> And, I guess, more abstractly, that a "component" in the nexus may exist purely to represent a transformed view on an existing "component" rather than necessarily having to represent a fresh thing that is "out there in the world"
2016-02-16T16:15:45 <simonjb> yes, agreed
2016-02-16T16:16:13 <Bosmon> And, if there is STILL space in your 5-minute budget, to stress that changes are arbitrarily JSON-valued, rather than just being restricted to primitive values
2016-02-16T16:16:24 <Bosmon> There\'s an awful lot of "reactive programming" out there that can really only make sense of leaves
2016-02-16T16:17:15 <Bosmon> But to us, a "change" is really a "diff" of an arbitrarily deep tree of JSON-valued state at two successive instants in time
2016-02-16T16:17:28 <simonjb> I\'ll see if I can fit that in but agree that it\'s important to convey
2016-02-16T16:17:36 <simonjb> yes
2016-02-16T16:17:51 <Bosmon> This is perhaps the most significant difference between our conception and some kind of "vanilla FRP"
2016-02-16T16:18:09 <Bosmon> In that we naturally support aggregation and deaggregation of signals into composites and back out again
2016-02-16T16:19:01 <Bosmon> Another bullet point that could go into "next steps" is "Thinking about other ways of treating values that change over time"
2016-02-16T16:19:15 <simonjb> sometimes these things see so familiar that it\'s not always easy to remember what others might not know or that they might be familiar with something that has similarities but to assume too much similarity would be misleading
2016-02-16T16:19:23 <Bosmon> Yes
2016-02-16T16:20:12 <Bosmon> The pull that tugs you into thinking that someone who is using some familiar words to describe something, is describing something familiar to you, is almost impossible to resist....
2016-02-16T16:20:32 <simonjb> totally
2016-02-16T16:20:47 <simonjb> thanks Bosmon, these comments are very helpful
2016-02-16T16:21:24 <Bosmon> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7451317/is-the-signal-representation-of-functional-reactive-programming-correct
2016-02-16T16:22:43 <Bosmon> So I think there are some "well-known holes" in restricting our space of citizens to be "functions from behaviour to behaviour" as we currently do
2016-02-16T16:22:54 <Bosmon> There are certain kinds of things that are interesting to users that we can\'t easiliy represent
2016-02-16T16:23:08 <Bosmon> Of which Justin_o ran into an interesting example a while back when he implemented our TTS component
2016-02-16T16:23:31 <Bosmon> This is a kind of "double-ended queue" in which things are contributed, and then they drain out at the other end at an essentially unpredictable rate
2016-02-16T16:24:03 <Bosmon> If we had such a thing in the Nexus, it would just have to be represented quite clumsily in pure JS code
2016-02-16T16:24:25 <Bosmon> And we couldn\'t do anything useful to capture the natural constraints that exist between its possible states at successive instants of time
2016-02-16T16:24:42 <Bosmon> So, this is the kind of thing that could go into the "things to think about in the future" box :)
2016-02-16T16:26:06 <Bosmon> One way of thinking about the queue could be as a "variant integrator"
2016-02-16T16:26:24 <Bosmon> The "standard integrator" of changes simply integrates them to their "equivalent signal" of which they are the differential
2016-02-16T16:26:41 <Bosmon> But the "nonstandard integrator" of the TTS system integrates them into a kind of "laggy queue"
2016-02-16T16:26:57 <simonjb> sorry Bosmon, I need to pop out soon and grab some food
2016-02-16T16:27:00 <Bosmon> Where "old changes" can accumulate for a longer time than the one necessary to receive the "new change"
2016-02-16T16:27:05 <Bosmon> Ok no worries :)
2016-02-16T16:27:28 <simonjb> when I\'m back I\'ll made your suggested edits to the slides
2016-02-16T16:27:38 <simonjb> thanks again for your input
2016-02-16T16:27:41 <Bosmon> Awesome, sorry to distract you :)

2016-02-16T17:58:14 <danayo> cindyli: yes, Justin_o and I had a chat about that a while back...I was imagining that they would flot over the UIO panel
2016-02-16T17:58:31 <danayo> but that brought up the question of whether or not the panel should always be open upon returning to the site
2016-02-16T17:59:09 <danayo> perhaps if the user selected export from the close panel tab, upon returning it should still be closed cindyli
2016-02-16T17:59:32 <danayo> and the message could appear almost like a tooltip pointing to the tab (I will sketch this quickly)
2016-02-16T17:59:55 <danayo> that should have read *closed panel tab

2016-02-16T19:15:16 <simonjb> but it does appear to be fine -- nothing obvious missing
2016-02-16T19:16:30 <simonjb> so, hopefully it\'s fine as is
2016-02-16T19:16:56 <simonjb> and either the fonts aren\'t actually being used, or PowerPoint is making a reasonable substitution
2016-02-16T19:17:03 <simonjb> avtar ^
2016-02-16T19:18:19 <avtar> simonjb: i sent another revision
2016-02-16T19:23:49 <simonjb> sorry avtar, still getting the same error -- I think it\'s fine to ignore
2016-02-16T19:24:59 <avtar> ok. since it\'s til\'s template and his laptop is being used with the projector i\'m assuming he won\'t get that font error
2016-02-16T19:25:27 <colinclark> michelled, Bosmon, simonjb: What do you think of my edits to slide 5 of michelled\'s Infusion SP2 BB slide deck, and of removing everything after it?
2016-02-16T19:25:36 <simonjb> avtar: yeah, I think we\'re cool
2016-02-16T19:25:37 <avtar> unless google docs picked one that was similar to the one in the original template
2016-02-16T19:25:52 <colinclark> basically, of presenting one of the key features of our upcoming work as "creating Infusion components to support sonification?"
2016-02-16T19:26:11 <colinclark> rather than introducing extra complexity of having to explain what this "Flocking" thing is and where it came from and how it relates
2016-02-16T19:26:43 <colinclark> basically, this means we will continue to carve off the reusable portions of our chart authoring work and offer them up as Infusion components for anyone to use
2016-02-16T19:26:48 <colinclark> which seems fairly straightforward
2016-02-16T19:30:13 <simonjb> this seems very reasonable to me
2016-02-16T19:31:39 <colinclark> ok
2016-02-16T19:31:44 <colinclark> let\'s do it then
2016-02-16T19:32:04 <colinclark> I mean, I was thinking that we already have the early phases of this
2016-02-16T19:32:15 <colinclark> with the components Alan created to sequence TTS with audio output
2016-02-16T19:32:28 <colinclark> with the little "additive synthesis expander" I will factor out from it as well
2016-02-16T19:32:35 <colinclark> even things like the play and pause buttons
2016-02-16T19:33:37 <colinclark> so you have those examples in your back pocket, simonjb, as illustration of where we\'re going with this
2016-02-16T19:33:44 <colinclark> not to mention the gamelan
