2016-05-06T11:05:08 <jhernandez> I've read your last comment on https://github.com/amb26/linux/pull/2

2016-05-06T11:05:42 <jhernandez> I've got a question
2016-05-06T11:06:25 <jhernandez> is it ok by just rejecting the promise, or should I do anything else?
2016-05-06T11:06:31 <Bosmon> It is ok
2016-05-06T11:07:22 <jhernandez> what the framework is supposed to do when getting that promise rejected?
