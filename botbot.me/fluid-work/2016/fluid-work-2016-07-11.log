b'2016-07-11T16:04:21 <alanharnum> & use guidelines until we feel the design is more "card-like"
2016-07-11T16:04:39 <michelled> guidelines might sound a little too \'fixed\' if you know what I mean. maybe \'guides\' would be better?
2016-07-11T16:04:56 <michelled> or we could just go with cards
2016-07-11T16:05:36 <michelled> it gets at the idea that we\'ve got a bunch of techniques and you pick and choose from them
2016-07-11T16:05:42 <danayo> michelled: we call them guidelines on the site and on the printed cards ...
2016-07-11T16:05:46 * colinclark joined the channel
2016-07-11T16:05:51 <michelled> guidelines feels more like something that\'s prescriptive
2016-07-11T16:06:27 <alanharnum> approaches? techniques? methods?
2016-07-11T16:07:17 <jhung> I like cards.
2016-07-11T16:09:05 * kasparnet joined the channel
2016-07-11T16:09:25 <danayo> I agree that guidelines sounds a bit strong michelled ... not sure about calling them "Inclusive Design Cards" jhung - because that\'s the physical form of them - but they contain the ... approaches/guidelines/methods
2016-07-11T16:10:21 <danayo> "The Inclusive Design Guide" ?
2016-07-11T16:11:52 <jhung> So the domain would be "guides.inclusivedesign.ca"? works for me.
2016-07-11T16:13:27 <danayo> or guide.inclusivedesign.ca jhung ?
2016-07-11T16:14:24 * kasparnet has quit
2016-07-11T16:15:15 <jhung> that\'s fine danayo. What do others think? guide.inclusivedesign.ca?
2016-07-11T16:15:44 <jhung> Or we can call it the "Inclusive Design Learning Handbook"? :P joking\xe2\x80\xa6
2016-07-11T16:15:48 <danayo> hahahaha
2016-07-11T16:16:26 <michelled> danayo: had you seen this? simonjb just showed it to me: http://www3.eng.cam.ac.uk/inclusivedesign/dtisurvey/cards.php
2016-07-11T16:17:11 <danayo> thanks michelled, simonjb, hadn\'t seen it
2016-07-11T16:18:30 <simonjb> I think I like guide.inclusivedesign.ca jhung and danayo -- I was thinking "cards" but it\'s maybe good to get away from the physical form in the domain naming
2016-07-11T16:20:02 <simonjb> howto.inclusivedesign.ca ?
2016-07-11T16:21:34 <danayo> I like howto as a domain name, simonjb, just wasn\'t sure how we could work it into the title itself - "How To do Inclusive Design", or "Inclusive Design How-To"  ??
2016-07-11T16:22:06 <danayo> I suppose the domain name doesn\'t have to match the title ?

2016-07-11T16:32:23 <Jess_> i agree with simonjb \xe2\x80\x94 best to stay away from the form of the thing, i.e. cards
2016-07-11T16:33:33 <simonjb> My vote is for ""guide
2016-07-11T16:35:08 * PaliwalSparsh2 joined the channel
2016-07-11T16:35:21 <michelled> Jess_: do you prefer \'guide\' or \'howto\'?
2016-07-11T16:36:10 <Jess_> michelled: i have an ever so slight preference for howto \xe2\x80\x94 as i think you said, guide is pretty prescriptive and since we expect this to grow and change, howto might fit better
2016-07-11T16:36:28 <Jess_> something that denotes change and evolution would be great
2016-07-11T16:37:08 <simonjb> For me I\'m thinking "guide" as in "field guide" rather than "guidelines"
2016-07-11T16:38:01 <simonjb> Which have different feels but I also see that "guide" by itself could be prescriptive
2016-07-11T16:38:51 <Jess_> simonjb: i\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if there\xe2\x80\x99s a word that captures the incompleteness of it?
2016-07-11T16:39:06 <simonjb> good question Jess_
2016-07-11T16:42:00 <danayo> open
2016-07-11T16:42:02 <danayo> open-ended
2016-07-11T16:42:14 <danayo> somehow guide sounds looser to me than guidelines
2016-07-11T16:44:22 <danayo> I like The Inclusive Design Guide and guide.inclusivedesign.ca michelled simonjb alanharnum jhung Jess_

2016-07-11T16:45:36 <danayo> yes
2016-07-11T16:45:44 <alanharnum> sounds like guide.inclusivedesign.ca has the floor?
2016-07-11T16:45:55 <michelled> jhung: looks to me like we have a winner. unless you hear a strong argument against it, let\'s go ahead with guide.inclusivedesign.ca. I suppose you\'ll need to pull in alanharnum and gtirloni now :)
2016-07-11T16:45:56 <simonjb> Maybe a subtitle that captures something about ongoing, evolving, and such?
2016-07-11T16:46:31 <Jess_> +1
2016-07-11T16:46:54 <danayo> for sure simonjb, we have that in the intro
2016-07-11T16:47:12 <simonjb> cool
2016-07-11T16:47:30 <danayo> The guidelines focus on the process of digital design. However, they can be applied to the design of services, the built environment and physical products, as well as processes like workshops, meetings, conferences, and even our daily interactions with one another. They can be used by anyone, and will remain a work in progress. The concepts and methods captured within them are ever-evolving as we learn more about how to design inclusi
2016-07-11T16:47:31 <danayo> into all that we do.
2016-07-11T16:47:39 <jhung> michelled: will do. I\'ll do that once the ownership of the repo is transferred. Probably tomorrow some time.
2016-07-11T16:48:07 <danayo> jhung, still ok to merge your changes now?
2016-07-11T16:48:16 <jhung> yep

2016-07-11T14:45:04 <danayo> it looks ok, just some concerns about, for example, the cat\'s body against the background (the contrast is quite low)
2016-07-11T14:45:20 <PaliwalSparsh> danayo I have implemented it in the game wanted to show you but rawgit is causing some problems also wanted your review on the size pref one.
2016-07-11T14:45:32 <danayo> ah ok PaliwalSparsh
2016-07-11T14:46:48 <PaliwalSparsh> Actually there are many places in the game where contrast ratio is not the required 4.5:1 that I should have been
2016-07-11T14:48:09 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: you can get rawgit to work easier if you use a commit hash instead of branch
2016-07-11T14:49:03 <bens_> hey gtirloni, avtar, a little while ago i had run into a issue having a public network on the windows 10 vm that prevented vagrant provisioning over winrm. Just wanted to share the work around i\'m doing with you and the IRC logs. This powershell command changes the network type to private and lets winrm connect: Set-NetConnectionProfile -InterfaceAlias Ethernet -NetworkCategory Private
2016-07-11T14:49:36 <gtirloni> bens_: nice! thanks for sharing
2016-07-11T14:49:44 <PaliwalSparsh> Justin_o: Sure hope that could be helpful I will google it making branch for everything is really troublesome.
2016-07-11T14:49:50 <avtar> bens_: thanks :D
2016-07-11T14:50:11 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: you can just take the url of a branch you have and replace the branch name with a commit hash
2016-07-11T14:50:26 <Justin_o> the url structure is the same from github

2016-07-11T15:51:42 <TPark> danayo, jhung, sepidehshahi, when would you be free to discuss with godfrey and me regarding the IDLH and guidelines, if not today, tomorrow
2016-07-11T15:51:46 <jhung> probably once danayo and I are done making fixes Justin_o. So maybe later this afternoon or tomorrow?

2016-07-11T15:53:30 <Justin_o> jhung: okay.. thanks..
2016-07-11T15:54:44 <jhung> TPark - later this afternoon works. After 2:30p Tomorrow is busy for me, but feel free to meet anyway and I\'ll try to join / listen in.
2016-07-11T15:55:11 * gabrielmancini joined the channel
2016-07-11T15:59:08 <danayo> TPark: I can also meet later this afternoon or tomorrow after crit
2016-07-11T15:59:23 <michelled> jhung, alanharnum: colin thinks the idea of using the inclusivedesign domain for the cards is a good one.
2016-07-11T15:59:31 <michelled> what was the proposed URL given that?
2016-07-11T15:59:42 <alanharnum> cards.inclusivedesign.ca was what i proposed
2016-07-11T15:59:42 * gabrielmancini has quit
2016-07-11T15:59:50 <alanharnum> it\'s short and easily memorable
2016-07-11T16:00:23 <michelled> danayo, sepidehshahi: what do you think about that url? ^
2016-07-11T16:00:31 <jhung> alanharnum: at the moment the site looks very much like any of our docs sites. So it\'s not very "card like" at least for now.
2016-07-11T16:00:41 <jhung> Also we don\'t call the content "cards" currently.
2016-07-11T16:00:52 <alanharnum> ah
2016-07-11T16:00:58 <danayo> i like that alanharnum. I was also wondering about guidelines.inclusivedesign.ca
2016-07-11T16:01:08 <danayo> what I like about "cards" is its distinct
2016-07-11T16:01:12 <alanharnum> i won\'t point out that .cards domains now exist :)
2016-07-11T16:01:17 <alanharnum> so we could get inclusivedesign.cards
2016-07-11T16:01:19 <TPark> danaya, jhung, sepidehshahi, then if 2:30 today works for everyone today, let\'s meet then
2016-07-11T16:01:20 <alanharnum> ;)
2016-07-11T16:01:49 <sepidehshahi> sure TPark
2016-07-11T16:01:52 <danayo> distinct from other things we have I mean jhung alanharnum michelled
2016-07-11T16:02:04 <alanharnum> guidelines.inclusivedesign.ca also works
2016-07-11T16:02:26 <TPark> danayo, sorry misspelled your name. Does 2:30 work for you?
2016-07-11T16:02:28 <jhung> danayo: I guess since we envision the visual design to be more "card-like" in the future, we could very well use cards.inclusivedesign.ca
2016-07-11T16:02:48 <danayo> yeah jhung, I get your concern though - was also thinking that we should probably include links to downloadable/printable versions of cards
2016-07-11T16:03:14 <danayo> and yes, in future jhung, they will look more like cards online :)
2016-07-11T16:04:04 <alanharnum> we could set up both guidelines.inclusivedesign.ca and cards.inclusivedesign.ca
2016-07-11T16:04:21 <danayo> TPark: works for me
