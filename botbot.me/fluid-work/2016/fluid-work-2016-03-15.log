2016-03-15T21:30:41 <akshay> I made this while I was tinkering with Blockly almost an year back, utilizing a few online resources and Blockly's documentation. I want to extend this to my preference discovery game as I have conveyed you earlier.

2016-03-15T21:56:34 <akshay> I have also made a game based on this, something what you'll get here https://blockly-games.appspot.com, but that was for a local NPO and I don't have permission to upload that
2016-03-15T21:57:42 <akshay> sgithens: The preference editor is something very basic which I piled in from quite a few online resource while I was learning Blockly.
2016-03-15T21:58:11 <sgithens> akshay: Cool, will take a look
2016-03-15T22:00:13 <akshay> But this idea can be extended to the Preference framework and the first discovery game as I read on the brainstorming ideas page that you guys were looking for a game to teach coding which is a part of early digital literacy.

b'2016-03-15T16:04:35 <danayo> PaliwalSparsh42: perhaps think about ways that you yourself might want to try some preferences out - how would you figure out what works best for you?
2016-03-15T16:05:05 <danayo> could you drop link again PaliwalSparsh42 and I\'ll take a look

2016-03-15T16:12:37 <cindyli> Justin_o: it seems git tag names cannot have spaces in it
2016-03-15T16:13:07 <Justin_o> :(
2016-03-15T16:13:16 <cindyli> Justin_o: btw, i don\'t see a PGA tag name with 0001
2016-03-15T16:13:28 <Justin_o> cindyli: that\'s because there isn\'t one :)
2016-03-15T16:13:54 <cindyli> Justin_o: so, r u sure u wanna start with 0002, or there\'s a plan to create 0001?
2016-03-15T16:14:02 <Justin_o> the explore tool was from PGA task order 1, first round of FD was task order 2 and we are working on task order 3 now, which is the second round of FD work
2016-03-15T16:14:14 <cindyli> ok, i see. thanks, Justin_o
2016-03-15T16:14:33 <Justin_o> maybe you can use underscores.. let me look something up about tag names though
2016-03-15T16:14:35 <Justin_o> cindyli: ^
2016-03-15T16:14:44 <cindyli> ok
2016-03-15T16:15:51 <Justin_o> cindyli: so it\'s not really a release version, it\'s more of a simple way to preserve a reference to a point in time
2016-03-15T16:16:38 <Justin_o> cindyli: so i think something like PGA-0002 or PGA_0002 would be okay, or something more specific like PGA_task_order_0002
2016-03-15T16:16:44 <Justin_o> cindyli: what do you think?
2016-03-15T16:17:24 <Justin_o> another option would be to do this as a branch instead of a tag, but i\'m afraid that might cause confusion about what\'s in master
2016-03-15T16:17:37 <Justin_o> and would probably want a tag associated with branch point anyways
2016-03-15T16:17:59 <cindyli> great names. i lean towards "PGA_task_order_0002" which provides more information, of course, i will also add those information in the message that\'s associated with this tag, Justin_o

2016-03-15T17:03:56 <Justin_o> akshay: yes, it\'s a general issue that these things are happening, we have an umbrella issue for this too and are filing specific ones as we spot them. https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-1617
2016-03-15T17:04:23 <Ak_____> @danayo I found the answer to that question. Thank you.

2016-03-15T17:10:58 <Ak_____> Justin_o: Okay thanks.
2016-03-15T17:13:01 * gabrielmancini has quit
2016-03-15T17:13:07 <danayo> PaliwalSparsh1: I like how you\'re beginning to integrate the preference selection into the game. You might want to think about the flow of the game and how one screen/scene might relate to the others (like a quest, or leading toward some goal). And it looks like you are thinking about tool tips / audio feedback which is great. Could you annotate the first page with a description? I\'m not sure what\'s going on there.
2016-03-15T17:13:19 <Ak_____> danayo: The game concept it is based around general things like colors, surroundings etc. or would specific topics also be covered under it?
2016-03-15T17:14:06 <danayo> I\'m not entirely sure what you are asking Ak_____, when you say specific topics, do you mean learning subjects?
2016-03-15T17:14:57 <Ak_____> danayo: Yes. Like having specific games for learning history, chemistry or basic stuff in maths.
2016-03-15T17:17:39 <danayo> Ak_____: I think it could be great to incorporate some learning as a way to try out the preferences - for example, I set preferences x, Y, Z and then I worked through some math questions (or I set them AS I was working through the math questions) and it seemed to help me. But it is not a specific requirement. Playing the game itself could provide a way to self-evaluate

2016-03-15T17:23:58 <danayo> Ak_____: any of the preferences can be applied to/help in the learning environment (contrast, large font, self-voicing, etc) but there are also some that are more specific to learning - like turning on annotated definitions, for example. It seems that the distinction I made in the project description is not helpful - I\'m going to update it / add examples

2016-03-15T17:27:34 <Ak_____> danayo: Okay, so the idea behind the project is to make tools like contrast, large font, definitions, voice readability being made available to users so that they can easily learn something. Right?
2016-03-15T17:29:13 * PaliwalSparsh joined the channel
2016-03-15T17:34:49 <danayo> yes Ak_____, and more than just making them available, we want them to be able to discover them and try them out them in a fun way

2016-03-15T17:54:07 <Justin_o> akshay: you\'d need to fill out the CLA and return it. If you have a digital signature that you can attach to the document in the signature section you can use that. Otherwise you\'ll need to print, sign, and scan it. I think there are apps on phones these days that would be able to do the scanning portion if that helps.
2016-03-15T17:55:38 <akshay> ya I\'m trying that out , otherwise I\'ll send you a scanned document tomorrow morning.
2016-03-15T17:56:26 <PaliwalSparsh1> @akshay use camscanner in android great app it will also make a pdf for you I did it in the same manner
2016-03-15T17:57:04 <danayo> colinclark: is there a "master list" of GPII preferences somewhere? We had a spreadsheet of common terms in Cloud 4 All, but I\'m wondering if there\'s something more comprehensive?
2016-03-15T17:58:35 <colinclark> It\'s funny you ask this, danayo
2016-03-15T17:58:42 <colinclark> Not exactly, but it\'s coming
2016-03-15T17:58:56 <danayo> ok
2016-03-15T17:58:59 <colinclark> Sandra and Alejandro are working on a list
2016-03-15T17:59:04 <danayo> great
2016-03-15T17:59:16 <colinclark> kasparnet can probably point you to the list of common terms we have so far
2016-03-15T17:59:21 <colinclark> were he here, anyway :)
2016-03-15T17:59:31 <danayo> ah, that would be great
2016-03-15T17:59:37 <danayo> I\'ll ping him later
2016-03-15T17:59:48 <danayo> perhaps I can track down the Cloud4All list for now

2016-03-15T18:02:30 <gloob> I feel really ignored for a seconds
2016-03-15T18:02:55 <gloob> danayo: for what?
2016-03-15T18:03:31 <gloob> danayo: because based on for what you want them could be one list or another :-)
2016-03-15T18:03:55 <gloob> so in short there\'s not a full master list until now
2016-03-15T18:05:22 * PaliwalSparsh1 has quit
2016-03-15T18:06:35 <danayo> thanks gloob it came up in relation to a GSoC project (students wanting a better understanding of what kinds of preferences we\'re talking about when we talk about setting preferences), but it\'s always helpful to have a list to refer to
2016-03-15T18:06:54 <gloob> oh yes
2016-03-15T18:07:15 <gloob> in fact, it could be an awesome gsoc project ;-)
2016-03-15T18:07:29 <gloob> nah, I think we are near of having something
2016-03-15T18:07:38 <gloob> did GSoC started?
2016-03-15T18:07:41 <gloob> not yet, right?
2016-03-15T18:07:47 <gloob> proposal time or waht
2016-03-15T18:08:00 <danayo> proposal time
2016-03-15T18:08:27 <gloob> in that case the only thing we have is from cloud4all
2016-03-15T18:08:34 <gloob> sorry danayo
2016-03-15T18:09:00 <danayo> no worries gloob, do you happen to have a link handy to cloud4all list?
2016-03-15T18:09:05 <danayo> save me from digging :)
2016-03-15T18:09:10 <gloob> pfff, no
2016-03-15T18:09:12 <danayo> ok
2016-03-15T18:09:15 <danayo> I\'ll dig
2016-03-15T18:09:23 <gloob> find something is slowly die a bit faster
2016-03-15T18:09:28 <gloob> to try to *
2016-03-15T18:09:44 <gloob> we have a big fragmentation of information

2016-03-15T15:23:10 <akshay> There a few bugs mentioned in the starting of the excel sheet, you can check if they are any relevant.
2016-03-15T15:26:13 <Justin_o> colinclark, cindyli: I hoping we can add a git tag to the current master of First Discovery Tool in the GPII space. I\'ve filed a JIRA for this https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-1686
2016-03-15T15:26:51 <Justin_o> I\'m hoping that one of the GPII committers would be able to do that for us
2016-03-15T15:27:12 <colinclark> cindyli is our newest official committer :)
2016-03-15T15:28:46 <cindyli> haha, i could give a try, Justin_o, colinclark, the first thing would be to figure out how to do it. will try with my own repo first :)

2016-03-15T15:34:52 <PaliwalSparsh42> @Justin_o no problem justin please can you help me with what do we mean by learning preferences and learning to learn

2016-03-15T15:35:50 <gloob> open questions for all, so current status of mac implementation of gpii is what we have here https://github.com/GPII/mac right?
2016-03-15T15:36:43 <gloob> cindyli: just don\'t forget to make a git push origin --tags :-D, I remember two times that I was the only one with some tags in the source code, pretty embarrasing
2016-03-15T15:37:07 <dins> michelled https://github.com/Dinuka2013513/music-ctrls
2016-03-15T15:37:18 <dins> this is the updated code
2016-03-15T15:37:32 <dins> I added mouse events too
2016-03-15T15:44:56 <michelled> hi dins, thanks for sharing that
2016-03-15T15:45:44 <cindyli> a very nice article, reading thru\xe2\x80\xa6, thanks, Justin_o
2016-03-15T15:46:11 * arshad__ joined the channel
2016-03-15T15:47:24 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh42: danayo will be able to give you the full answer, but to get you started, maybe think about the preferences being applied to a learning environment. And the idea that making some change might assist with achieving your learning outcomes.
2016-03-15T15:48:17 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2016-03-15T15:49:01 <Justin_o> akshay: thanks so much for the testing summary, will look it over
2016-03-15T15:52:54 <cindyli> Justin_o: what type of tag should be created for PGA: annotated or lightweight?
2016-03-15T15:53:14 <cindyli> annotated tags seem more informative
2016-03-15T15:54:57 <danayo> PaliwalSparsh42: learning to learn is about discovering for myself how I learn best - what learning and teaching styles might work best for me as well as what preferences I need to help me learn best, including how I prefer to consume content (e.g. do I prefer to read it or do I prefer to hear it read), or perhaps when reading digital content I like to have annotations turned on that provide me with word definitions, etc
2016-03-15T15:55:31 * divamgupta_ has quit
2016-03-15T15:56:47 <PaliwalSparsh42> @danayo then we can say these will align somewhat with the digital preferences only. Os there aome article or presentation which can help me
2016-03-15T15:57:31 <danayo> PaliwalSparsh42: the most important thing as it relates to this project is that it\'s about ME learning about my own preferences, rather than having someone else decide what\'s best for me
2016-03-15T15:58:03 <danayo> and yes, any of the digital preferences can be applied to the learning environment
2016-03-15T15:58:31 <danayo> but there are also some that are specific to learning
2016-03-15T15:59:19 <danayo> like annotated definitions, for example (although again this could apply more broadly)
2016-03-15T15:59:42 * Yan_Hu has quit
2016-03-15T16:00:33 <danayo> I\'ll see what I can find in terms of a list of preferences, but for now I would focus more on the approach and how it supports a "learning to learn" environment
2016-03-15T16:00:43 <danayo> PaliwalSparsh42 ^
2016-03-15T16:00:57 <danayo> does that help?
2016-03-15T16:01:07 <michelled> dins, I was just talking to simonjb - we are about to grab lunch and we\'ll both take a look at your code after that :)
2016-03-15T16:01:19 <Justin_o> cindyli: probably up to you.. i always tend to make annotated flags though so that it includes all the info
2016-03-15T16:01:33 <cindyli> good to know. thanks, Justin_o
2016-03-15T16:01:34 <michelled> dins, if we are ever not in the channel, feel free to send an email to the fluid-work list - we\'ll be certain to see that
