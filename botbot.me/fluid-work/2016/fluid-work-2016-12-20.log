2016-12-20T17:53:05 <simonjb> hey colinclark, when would work for you to chat? do we know if Bosmon is available today?
2016-12-20T17:53:16 <colinclark> I haven\'t heard from him today at all
2016-12-20T17:53:24 <colinclark> but would could go ahead without him if you want
2016-12-20T17:53:42 <colinclark> In terms of timing, I\'m here until about 6 pm EDT, and am only booked at 3 pm
2016-12-20T17:53:50 <colinclark> but I\'d like to sneak off shortly to get some take away lunch

2016-12-20T17:56:21 <colinclark> is 4 pm your time good?
2016-12-20T17:56:30 <simonjb> yes, that works for me
2016-12-20T17:56:32 <colinclark> ok great
2016-12-20T17:56:35 <colinclark> thanks for meeting so late :)
2016-12-20T17:57:00 <simonjb> no problem, and it gives us time if Bosmon could be available
2016-12-20T17:59:21 <colinclark> yup totally

2016-12-20T18:39:25 <gtirloni> Justin_o: it\'s hosted with us. it tracks the master branch
2016-12-20T18:39:50 <Justin_o> gtirloni: thanks, so i can remove the ghpages branch from the repo?
2016-12-20T18:40:13 <gtirloni> yes
2016-12-20T18:40:13 <Justin_o> https://github.com/fluid-project/fluidproject.org/tree/gh-pages
2016-12-20T18:40:17 <Justin_o> gtirloni: thanks
2016-12-20T18:40:19 <gtirloni> yw!
2016-12-20T18:40:28 <gtirloni> the static websites hosted with us are defined here: https://github.com/inclusive-design/ci-service/tree/master/jenkins_jobs
2016-12-20T18:40:55 <Justin_o> gtirloni: thanks
2016-12-20T18:41:11 <Justin_o> so each directory corresponds to a different site
2016-12-20T18:42:02 <gtirloni> each website-* file is a different website (except snow-dev, which is a plugin
2016-12-20T18:43:03 <Justin_o> gtirloni: cool thanks
2016-12-20T18:49:42 <Justin_o> jhung: i\'m running the fluidproject.org site locally to try to do some dev work on it, but the icons aren\'t showing up
2016-12-20T18:49:45 <Justin_o> any ideas?
2016-12-20T18:51:42 * michelled joined the channel
2016-12-20T18:53:17 <jhung> Justin_o: Sounds like a font issue. Can you confirm that the icon font is present and the path is correct in the HTML?
2016-12-20T18:53:44 <Justin_o> jhung: i\'m getting a CORS error in the console
2016-12-20T18:53:50 <Justin_o> for the fonts
2016-12-20T18:53:57 <Justin_o> have you encountered that before?
2016-12-20T18:55:10 <jhung> Justin_o: "CORS"? I\'ve never seen that error before. Is it only for a particular font?
2016-12-20T18:55:56 <Justin_o> jhung: it\'s for InfusionIcons-PrefsEditor.ttf, OpenSans-Semibold.ttf and fluid-community.ttf
2016-12-20T18:57:22 <jhung> Justin_o: if you\'re around after our PhET call, maybe we can Vidyo. Otherwise I can help take a look tomorrow morning when I\'m in.
