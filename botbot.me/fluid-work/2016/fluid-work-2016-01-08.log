2016-01-08T19:10:12 <alanharnum> colinclark: Bosomon said he could merge it
2016-01-08T19:10:19 <colinclark> ok
2016-01-08T19:10:33 <alanharnum> colinclark: so assume that will happen shortly - don't worry about it :) thanks tho

2016-01-08T14:35:41 <alanharnum> Bosmon kasparnet: the Docker PR for Universal discussed at the Wednesday arch meeting has been reviewed by amatas and avtar, & looks good to go: https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/434/
2016-01-08T14:35:58 <Justin_o> jhung: i think i have a scheme that we could use, i\'ve added it to the bottom of that wiki page
2016-01-08T14:38:21 <jhung> Justin_o: does this fix the issue with VoiceOver on iOS?
2016-01-08T14:38:34 <Justin_o> jhung: it should
2016-01-08T14:40:45 <jhung> excellent work Justin_o.
2016-01-08T14:41:16 <Justin_o> jhung: thanks, it\'s not the most ideal but i think it\'ll work... maybe we\'ll be able to come up with a better solution over time

2016-01-08T15:03:16 <zamcnema> Justin_o: did you run into a 400 bad request error in the preview pane yesterday when you were looking at that by any chance? Sorry wrong channel
2016-01-08T15:06:27 <Justin_o> zamcnema:  no i didn\'t get an error for that. I had a 404 when the url wasn\'t correct, but that\'s it
2016-01-08T15:06:40 <Justin_o> zamcnema: any more details on the error you\'re getting?
2016-01-08T15:07:42 <Justin_o> zamcnema: also, i only went so far as to get the "hello world" page you created, loaded in the iframe
2016-01-08T15:08:20 <zamcnema> Justin_o: Yea, thats what I\'m in the middle of.
2016-01-08T15:08:36 <Justin_o> zamcnema: so you aren\'t able to get that loaded in?
2016-01-08T15:08:44 <zamcnema> Justin_o: It might just be a browser issue
2016-01-08T15:09:02 <zamcnema> Justin_o: I\'ll get back to you in a few
2016-01-08T15:09:17 <Justin_o> zamcnema: possibly... you\'re running it through some sort of web server right?
2016-01-08T15:10:58 <zamcnema> Justin_o: Well, i intially thought it was that i miss understood something in the configuration that you explained to me, but I f12\'d the iframe and its not looking at the right place. I think either its not saving right or the browser saved something
2016-01-08T15:13:14 <Justin_o> zamcnema: what url is it trying to hit?
2016-01-08T15:13:55 <zamcnema> Justin_o: in the preview it had something like
2016-01-08T15:14:36 <zamcnema> Justin_o: %prefix/PrefsEditorPreview.html
2016-01-08T15:14:43 <zamcnema> which won\'t work here
2016-01-08T15:14:54 <Justin_o> zamcnema: yep, so that was the default value, but you need to override that
2016-01-08T15:14:59 <zamcnema> Justin_o:  so I changed it
2016-01-08T15:15:04 <Justin_o> did you set the templateURL option
2016-01-08T15:15:12 <Justin_o> okay
2016-01-08T15:15:20 <zamcnema> yes, thats why its kinda weird
2016-01-08T15:15:44 <zamcnema> let me close eclipse, maybe somethings up there
2016-01-08T15:16:23 <Justin_o> so it looks like it\'s not getting it.. so the most likely reasons is that the config change is in the wrong place.
2016-01-08T15:16:24 <zamcnema> after i changed it still didn\'t change when i loaded the page
2016-01-08T15:16:38 <zamcnema> ah okay, ill look around some more then
2016-01-08T15:16:52 <Justin_o> zamcnema: maybe first dump the browser cache, just in case
2016-01-08T15:18:12 * the-t-in-rtf has quit
2016-01-08T15:18:36 <zamcnema> hmm, is it changed anywhere else besides in the preview?
2016-01-08T15:20:34 <Justin_o> zamcnema: no it shouldn\'t be
2016-01-08T15:21:00 <Justin_o> zamcnema: i believe it\'s just the preview component that would set the url for the iframe. where did you set the url?
2016-01-08T15:23:46 <zamcnema> Justin_o: https://github.com/zamcnema/first-discovery-previewpane/blob/master/node_modules/gpii-first-discovery/src/js/preview.js
2016-01-08T15:25:27 <Justin_o> zamcnema: i guess i should have mentioned this yesterday... you don\'t have to copy that code over, you already have access to it from infusion-custom.js
2016-01-08T15:25:47 <Justin_o> so if you\'ve included this file as well there maybe a conflict between having two grades of the same name.
2016-01-08T15:27:36 * simonjb has quit
2016-01-08T15:28:26 <zamcnema> that is most likely it
2016-01-08T15:28:50 <zamcnema> it explains why its not making the changes at least
2016-01-08T15:30:02 <Justin_o> zamcnema: if you want to change the configuration you could do it in the options block you have https://github.com/zamcnema/first-discovery-previewpane/blob/master/node_modules/gpii-first-discovery/src/js/firstDiscoveryEditor.js#L131-L134
2016-01-08T15:30:52 <Justin_o> but as i mentioned yesterday, for the template url you\'ll actually want to pass it in from the demo itself. But you could put it here for a start just to see if things work.
2016-01-08T15:32:04 <zamcnema> yea that was the plan, get something to show up then try the pass through the demo
2016-01-08T15:32:20 <Justin_o> makes sense

2016-01-08T15:33:46 <yzen> anastasiac thanks
2016-01-08T15:34:26 <Justin_o> zamcnema: by the way, another minor thing i noticed yesterday was that you seem to be using tabs instead spaces for indentation. You\'ll probably want to switch to using spaces, as they\'ll likely want that for merging back up to the GPII repo. It should be a setting in your editor.
2016-01-08T15:35:24 <zamcnema> Justin_o: Okay, so it should be a setting for what? four spaces?
2016-01-08T15:35:43 <jhung> thanks anastasiac. :)

2016-01-08T15:40:53 <Justin_o> zamcnema: yes... i\'ll see if there\'s a style guide somewhere
2016-01-08T15:41:18 <zamcnema> Justin_o: that would be appreciated, I\'ll share with the rest of the team as well
2016-01-08T15:43:49 <Justin_o> zamcnema: so i\'m not sure if there is wiki document or anything but you could take a look at the .jshintrc file which has all the rules that we would run jshint against. https://github.com/zamcnema/first-discovery-previewpane/blob/master/node_modules/gpii-first-discovery/.jshintrc
2016-01-08T15:45:01 <Justin_o> it might not be so obvious to parse mentally though, but you could just run jshint there should be a grunt command to do this. However, the one from the fd server won\'t look into node_modules.
2016-01-08T15:45:53 <Justin_o> but i guess you could try running the one from the gpis-first-discovery directory.

2016-01-08T15:56:18 <zamcnema> Justin_o: I tried templateURL: "...html", but it didn\'t get it
2016-01-08T15:56:28 <zamcnema> after the listeners.
2016-01-08T16:00:12 <Justin_o> zamcnema: should be the same level as listeners.. templateUrl: "../src/html/PrefsEditorPreview.html",

2016-01-08T16:14:09 <zamcnema> Justin_o: okay i have it. that last one was on me, i had it in the right spot, i had a typo.  I\'ll push it through the demo next
2016-01-08T16:14:41 <Justin_o> zamcnema: great :)
2016-01-08T16:15:28 <zamcnema> Justin_o: thanks for the help again!
2016-01-08T16:16:32 <Justin_o> zamcnema: no problem, happy to help.
2016-01-08T16:17:30 <Justin_o> jhung: what do you think of this so far http://jobara.github.io/john-travoltage-html/
2016-01-08T16:19:21 <jhung> Justin_o: looks good. It\'s interesting to actually have the descriptions update. I feel it could use some tweaking now that I see it implemented.
2016-01-08T16:20:03 <jhung> One thing that\'s interesting is that the discharge caught me by surprise\xe2\x80\xa6 which is something you don\'t get with the graphical version. You get an idea of what is happening because the electrons start moving Justin_o.
2016-01-08T16:20:31 <Justin_o> jhung: and you get the "bzzt" sound
2016-01-08T16:20:46 <jhung> yeah
2016-01-08T16:21:18 <jhung> I guess that\'s something we can improve upon later once we hook up to phet.scenery.
2016-01-08T16:21:20 <Justin_o> jhung: i do have to fix some bugs with the discharge though, but i don\'t know if they\'ll change this perception at all
2016-01-08T16:21:39 <Justin_o> jhung: yah, i guess we can play around with it at that point
2016-01-08T16:22:18 <jhung> Justin_o I think what\'s missing is any communication about the movement of charges. I hope the scenery will allow us to report that the electrons are moving.
2016-01-08T16:23:12 <Justin_o> hung: hmm.. i guess you are sort of referring to the time it takes for the discharge to complete
2016-01-08T16:23:43 <Justin_o> jhung: the alerts are more binary, there or not.. we could have two.. one for when the discharge starts and one for when it completes i guess
2016-01-08T16:23:55 <Justin_o> for this sim currently it\'s all or nothing
2016-01-08T16:24:37 <jhung> yeah. I think for now it\'s okay that it\'s rather binary, but when we integrate w scenery, I would like to see how we can communicate some of the subtleties.
2016-01-08T16:25:12 <Justin_o> jhung: yes, makes sense
2016-01-08T16:26:48 <jhung> I would very much like to visually indicate the "interesting" areas on the slider. The middle 1/3 in the foot slider, and the mid-point (aka "closest") and the "very close" range Justin_o. I guess that would require CSS or is there something sliders provide to indicate markings?
2016-01-08T16:27:10 <Justin_o> jhung: not that i\'m aware of
2016-01-08T16:28:22 <jhung> ok. I guess we can accomplish this in CSS Justin_o. When I have time I can help with that.
