b'2016-07-29T15:23:28 <bens__> inline you\'ll have a one time hit to compile.. but with just a small class or so it is probably not noticeable
2016-07-29T15:24:52 <bens__> clown, the windows 10 box has the tools already if that is what repo you\'re working in. this is how i got it built: https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/80/files#r72808890
2016-07-29T15:25:05 <clown> I\'m following the dicutm:  make it work first; optimize later.
2016-07-29T15:25:19 * clown looks.
2016-07-29T15:27:36 <clown> bens__, I\'ve already added the dependency on edge to my package.json, but was unaware of the build.bat, and what it did.  Thanks for pointing that out.

2016-07-29T15:29:51 <bens__> clown, when you ready for the optimize phase i\'d suggest adding your .csx content to the library in the windows repo so it all gets built together

2016-07-29T18:34:32 <colinclark> it is now forkable
2016-07-29T18:34:44 <Bosmon> colinclark - brilliant!
2016-07-29T18:34:49 <michelled> thx colinclark!
2016-07-29T18:35:25 <alanharn_> relevant to jhung\'s interests: https://twitter.com/emilyyoshida/status/758850462787313664
2016-07-29T18:36:10 <colinclark> alanharn_: YOU STOLE MY POKEMON!
2016-07-29T18:36:21 <alanharn_> the only thing i stole
2016-07-29T18:36:31 <alanharn_> was an opportunity for a better zinger
2016-07-29T18:36:46 <colinclark> I discovered the best/worst Pokemon technique recently
2016-07-29T18:36:50 <alanharn_> because i should have called it "Magi-Clark" instead of "Magi-Colin" when I said it didn\'t have your name on it
2016-07-29T18:36:54 <colinclark> haha
2016-07-29T18:36:58 <alanharn_> since that rhymes better with Magikarp
2016-07-29T18:37:01 <colinclark> hahaha
2016-07-29T18:37:26 <colinclark> Playing Pokemon while in the car is very lucrative
2016-07-29T18:37:29 <colinclark> not while driving, of course
2016-07-29T18:37:36 <colinclark> but as a passenger
2016-07-29T18:38:33 <alanharnum_> million-dollar startup idea: like Uber, but for driving people around to catch Pokemon
2016-07-29T18:39:19 <colinclark> alanharnum_: There must be a domain name in there somewhere

2016-07-29T18:53:36 <avtar> what\'s done is done
2016-07-29T18:54:01 <alanharnum_> if only i\'d learned earlier
2016-07-29T18:54:04 <alanharnum_> that there\'s no undo
2016-07-29T18:54:11 <alanharnum_> for hurting a friend\'s feelings :(
2016-07-29T18:54:17 <avtar> but i do enjoy a good ol fashioned cat strut

2016-07-29T12:52:37 * Jess__ joined the channel
2016-07-29T12:52:43 <simonjb> dinuka: what would you like me to test? which issue has been fixed?
2016-07-29T12:53:31 <dinuka> Do you remember that terrible bug we had in the knob
2016-07-29T12:53:48 <dinuka> there were some unusual characters displaying when dragging
2016-07-29T12:54:08 <dinuka> specially in firefox
2016-07-29T12:54:08 <simonjb> yes, for sure -- you have a fix for that?
2016-07-29T12:54:15 <simonjb> that\'s great
2016-07-29T12:54:33 <dinuka> I think .... this PR has fixed that https://github.com/dinukadesilva/music-ctrls/pull/79
2016-07-29T12:55:16 <dinuka> before merging, I would like to get it tested in your machine too
2016-07-29T12:55:44 <dinuka> but, you have to checkout the branch and test it locally
2016-07-29T12:56:11 <simonjb> dinuka: you are using browser-specific CSS it looks like, is this right?
2016-07-29T12:56:24 <dinuka> yes
2016-07-29T12:56:42 <dinuka> I made the controller not selectable
2016-07-29T12:56:57 <simonjb> dinuka: did you try using preventDefault on mouse down?
2016-07-29T12:57:34 <dinuka> I\'m not sure
2016-07-29T12:57:55 <dinuka> wait I\'l give a try
2016-07-29T12:58:14 <simonjb> by concern with using browser-specific CSS is that we may miss some -- such as IE or Edge on Windows
2016-07-29T12:58:24 <simonjb> s/by/my/
2016-07-29T12:59:21 <simonjb> if we can use cross-browser support for disabling default behaviour, that would be preferred
2016-07-29T13:00:32 <simonjb> dinuka: do you want to pair on this? share your screen on vidyo?
2016-07-29T13:02:43 <dinuka> simonjb: I just tried using preventDefault on mouse down
2016-07-29T13:03:02 <dinuka> in that case mousemove in not working
2016-07-29T13:03:44 <simonjb> what event are you using to track the dragging of the mouse?
2016-07-29T13:03:59 <dinuka> yes
2016-07-29T13:04:07 <dinuka> By the way.... Do you think that using CSS styles is not a better way for this
2016-07-29T13:04:45 <simonjb> okay, instead try preventDefault on the mousemove
2016-07-29T13:05:38 <dinuka> simonjb: That is already there
2016-07-29T13:06:19 <simonjb> dinuka: can you give me a link to that part of the code?
2016-07-29T13:06:48 <dinuka> since we wanted to avoid scrolling in mobile devices, we had added that already
2016-07-29T13:06:50 <dinuka> sure

2016-07-29T13:08:11 <simonjb> if we can solve without non-standard CSS, that would be better, if non-standard CSS is the only way, then it\'s the only way but I\'d like to make sure we have tried the cross-browser approaches first
2016-07-29T13:08:50 <dinuka> hmmm.... yes

2016-07-29T13:11:51 <simonjb> dinuka: I was thinking about our discussion earlier in the week about responsiveness of sliders, have you tried experimenting with different values of preserveAspectRatio? https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/coords.html#PreserveAspectRatioAttribute
2016-07-29T13:13:21 <dinuka> Ah simonjb .... that\'s also fixed
2016-07-29T13:13:51 <dinuka> now the linear slider has become a really customization controller
2016-07-29T13:14:32 <dinuka> sure...  I should go through this too

2016-07-29T13:24:12 <dinuka> which is in this PR https://github.com/dinukadesilva/music-ctrls/pull/78
2016-07-29T13:25:05 <dinuka> simonjb: is there any way to implement routes in infusion
2016-07-29T13:25:15 <dinuka> same as in angular-routes
2016-07-29T13:25:43 <dinuka> actually for the demo site, I used angular just because of that
2016-07-29T13:25:44 <simonjb> dinuka: I\'m not familiar with angular-routes, what do they do?
2016-07-29T13:27:14 <simonjb> dinuka: you keep adding more and more technologies, this adds complexity -- I think it\'s better to minimise your dependencies -- the more stuff you add the harder it is to maintain in the future
2016-07-29T13:27:16 <dinuka> basically for single page applications, without redirecting, changing the content of the page based on the url
2016-07-29T13:27:33 <simonjb> why is this needed for a simple demo page?
