2016-10-12T20:34:09 <gtirloni> yarn is unlikely to fix the symlink issues with virtualbox shared folders on windows hosts, since it\'s a deficiency of virtualbox itself. i just ran into the same issue (EPROTO symlink).
2016-10-12T20:34:23 <gtirloni> however, that\'s exactly what the split node_modules workaround is supposed to help with
2016-10-12T20:34:51 <gtirloni> clown, not sure. i\'d try `vagrant provision` again
2016-10-12T20:35:34 <clown> that would be approximately the fifth time, but, what the hey.
2016-10-12T20:39:21 <gloob> simonjb: but there\'s differences or with shared folders or with I/O handling.
2016-10-12T20:40:19 <gloob> clown: is it compiled in the host?
2016-10-12T20:40:50 <gloob> a rm -rf node_modules and npm install in the guest seems appropiate
2016-10-12T20:40:59 <gloob> or reprovision, yes
2016-10-12T20:41:58 <clown> gloob, I don\'t know what you mean by "compiled in the host".
2016-10-12T20:42:28 <clown> but I haven\'t tried the npm insttall in the guest yet.  Only the provision from the host
2016-10-12T20:43:26 <clown> gtirloni:  the provision has finished.  Should I do a "vagrant reload"?
2016-10-12T20:46:09 <gtirloni> gloob, simonjb, it\'s funny that i\'m getting this exact error on win10 and vbox 5.1.6 and it\'s supposed to be fixed -- https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/14563
2016-10-12T20:46:40 <gtirloni> clown, that\'s always a good idea. looks like something is not installing right. i can check here in a moment.
2016-10-12T20:47:00 <gloob> regresion, that word :)
2016-10-12T20:47:13 <clown> gtirloni:  thanks!  But, I\'m going to be leaving in about 15 min.
2016-10-12T20:48:03 <gtirloni> clown, looks like i\'ll have to email you with the results. have a nice evening.
2016-10-12T20:48:12 <amatas> gtirloni, it seems that Vbox 5.1 is plenty of regressions
2016-10-12T20:48:20 <gtirloni> amatas gloob: yeah :(
2016-10-12T20:48:26 <clown> gtirloni:  many thanks.  You too (re:  good evening).
2016-10-12T20:48:28 <amatas> I don\'t know how it\'s declared as stable...
2016-10-12T20:48:38 <gtirloni> i\'m opening a bug report about this
2016-10-12T20:48:45 <gloob> grrreat
2016-10-12T20:50:03 <amatas> gtirloni, I\'ve reproduced the steps shown in the bug report and I\'m able to make the link without errors
2016-10-12T20:50:36 <amatas> could you tell me your environment setup?
2016-10-12T20:51:19 <gtirloni> i can\'t here ... https://www.pastery.net/jergbr/
2016-10-12T20:51:37 <gtirloni> now i\'m on win10 host, fedora24 guest, virtualbox 5.1.6 (host & guest additions)
2016-10-12T20:51:58 <amatas> mm
2016-10-12T20:52:05 <amatas> ok, I\'m i a linux host
2016-10-12T20:52:09 <amatas> in*
2016-10-12T20:52:15 <gtirloni> yeah, on linux it worked fine
2016-10-12T20:57:18 <clown> gtirloni:  gloob wins the prize.  Doing an npm install from within the guest fixed the problem.

2016-10-12T21:05:33 <avtar> and thanks, gloob
2016-10-12T21:05:36 <avtar> most of all
2016-10-12T21:07:09 <gloob> gtirloni: but they will say, and what?
2016-10-12T21:07:29 <gloob> is it should be a vbox bug no?
2016-10-12T21:07:34 <gtirloni> gloob, i\'ll "gloob endorses this complaint" and that will be enough to get them moving
2016-10-12T21:07:50 <gloob> well, if I subscribe xD
2016-10-12T21:08:02 <gloob> no, seriously
2016-10-12T21:08:02 <gtirloni> don\'t subscribe, that\'ll be too much pressure on them :P
2016-10-12T21:08:14 <gtirloni> it\'s a vbox bug, bug since npm has this --no-bin-links.. maybe the yarn folks will have some pity
2016-10-12T21:08:25 <gloob> ahhh
2016-10-12T21:08:34 <gloob> ok, they can trap it, right?
2016-10-12T21:08:54 <gloob> promoting a workaround
2016-10-12T21:09:31 <gloob> it is full of bugs
2016-10-12T21:09:33 <gloob> everywhere
2016-10-12T21:09:45 <gtirloni> let\'s see... right now with our split node_modules workaround.. either npm or yarn will work "fine"
2016-10-12T21:09:58 <gloob> got it

2016-10-12T14:52:15 <gtirloni> yeah.. and it looks like yarn doesn\'t cause the same side effects as npm does when running inside a virtualbox shared folder. just tested cindy\'s GPII-1274 branch (which either fails to install with vbox 5.0.26 or throws weird errors in vbox 5.1.6) and i don\'t see any errors from `yarn install`
2016-10-12T14:52:40 <gtirloni> detailed here: https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2062
2016-10-12T14:53:15 <gtirloni> we may need more testing with Windows/OSX hosts before saying it\'s the final solution.. i\'ve only tested on Linux/Linux (guest/host)
2016-10-12T14:54:05 <amatas> impressive
2016-10-12T14:54:46 <amatas> another positive reason to change npm by yarn
2016-10-12T14:57:18 <Justin_o> simonjb: regarding prefs framework optimization you can look at the metrics i calculated here https://cdn.rawgit.com/jobara/prefsFramework-optimization-examples/master/index.html Unfortunately the grade vs schema comparison was only done for the enhancer only case.

2016-10-12T15:49:39 <dinuka> just wanted to know..... :)
2016-10-12T15:50:17 <Justin_o> Bosmon: interesting, i guess it could have been worse like started boiling unexpectedly or something. I find that there are somethings that you just need to do manually for safety, security, and etc. It just doesn\'t seem right to have to debug your kettle without having had your tea first.

2016-10-12T17:48:14 <Justin_o> in the "On this Page" section
2016-10-12T17:48:54 <Justin_o> so far the only issues i\'ve found around this are related to the Documentation theme, which we don\'t seem to be using in that space https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-39960
2016-10-12T17:50:05 <Justin_o> any thoughts on this?
2016-10-12T17:55:35 <gtirloni> Justin_o: when you say it doesn\'t work, what do you mean? i see this: http://imgur.com/a/rBqTp
2016-10-12T17:56:16 <gtirloni> when you click on some item on the list, it doesn\'t go to that item?
2016-10-12T17:58:45 <avtar> i gave yarn a first try on a windows 10 vm and ran into one issue, although this seems to be related to git, virtualbox shared folders, and symlinks
2016-10-12T17:58:54 <avtar> https://www.pastery.net/pyktzq/raw/
2016-10-12T17:59:42 <Justin_o> gtirloni: i mean clicking on those links don\'t actually take you anywhere
2016-10-12T17:59:52 <gtirloni> avtar: looks like a git issue?
2016-10-12T18:00:47 <gtirloni> Justin_o: got it. i can reproduce here. not sure i have a solution for this. that ticket you linked here seems very accurate. we could try upgrading confluence
2016-10-12T18:00:49 <avtar> then repeating the same process in the vm but in a directory not managed by virtualbox yields better results https://www.pastery.net/rbgysz/raw/

2016-10-12T18:37:35 <gloob> haha
2016-10-12T18:37:42 <gloob> inverse situation than with npm
2016-10-12T18:38:45 <gtirloni> yea
2016-10-12T18:39:34 <gtirloni> i\'ll try to reboot into win10 and see if the win10 guest works the same (i\'m on f24 right now)
2016-10-12T18:58:02 <avtar> gloob: i learned about this recently https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/blob/master/resources/win-chocolatey/tools/chocolateyinstall.ps1.in#L1
2016-10-12T18:58:43 <avtar> i was hoping that was powershell\'s "set -e" equivalent but it only works for cmdlets and not executables
2016-10-12T19:02:15 <Justin_o> gtirloni: sorry, missed your reply. Perhaps upgrading would help, not sure though as the ticket i mentioned is specific to the Documentation theme, but we\'re just using the default one.
2016-10-12T19:04:30 <gloob> avtar: well, now if you use our function for execute commands we are throwing an exception when a problem arises, always, we can add an exit if we want too. https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/93/files#diff-86b23650008c0dbf56e868507e6136f1R43
2016-10-12T19:04:43 <gloob> avtar: I tested it and it works as expected
2016-10-12T19:04:52 <gloob> just with the throw
2016-10-12T19:05:13 <gloob> but well, we can add that ErrorActionPreference too
2016-10-12T19:05:43 <gloob> anyway, I\'m not happy with powershell, I think is really interesting for Windows things but not as complete solution
2016-10-12T19:06:18 <avtar> you don\'t want to use it on linux? ;)
2016-10-12T19:06:18 <gloob> I mean, I will vote NO for use powershell as scripting or provisioning tool for all the platforms
2016-10-12T19:06:22 <gloob> no
2016-10-12T19:06:29 <gloob> exactly, NO to that question xD

2016-10-12T19:09:26 <colinclark> It\'s called Powershell. What do you think?

2016-10-12T19:19:18 <gtirloni> we? gloob is our powershell wizard now :D
2016-10-12T19:20:09 <gloob> no no no, I\'m just a facilitator
2016-10-12T19:20:32 <gloob> I think avtar is the fast learner with powershell, he is always showing me new things about the language

2016-10-12T19:49:34 <simonjb> gtirloni: I was having a look at GPII-2082 -- what changed in VirtualBox 5.1.6 shared folder support (with respect to 5.0.26)
2016-10-12T19:52:21 <simonjb> are the changes documented?
2016-10-12T19:52:21 <gtirloni> simonjb: i have no idea. their changelog doesn\'t list anything obvious about shared folders
2016-10-12T19:52:31 <simonjb> ah, interesting
2016-10-12T19:52:40 <simonjb> thanks gtirloni
