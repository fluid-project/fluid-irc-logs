2016-10-18T14:51:59 <jhung> michelled, Justin_o: I took a look at the Stan\'s UIO mobile CSS. There would need to be some cleanup (i.e. use of px and component classnames as selectors) and refactoring (some deep nesting of stylus blocks, and some blocks looked confusing which may require some untangling and refactoring).
2016-10-18T14:54:43 <jhung> In terms of reusable styles,  there may not be very much since the new design has a different way of navigating between cards (new version has horizontal scroll instead of the current vertical). Any reusable styles are "trivial" like rounded corners etc. which will need to be refactored if we want to put them in a re-usable form.
2016-10-18T14:55:22 <jhung> I\'m guessing about 1 day for the clean-up, then a couple days for refactoring.
2016-10-18T14:57:03 <michelled> thanks jhung and Justin_o. It sounds like we are better off building from the new wireframes rather than using this pull request. Justin_o is that your sense?

2016-10-18T15:23:52 <Justin_o> michelled: yes, seems like it
2016-10-18T15:24:45 <Justin_o> although stan\'s work was valuable to start to uncover some potential issues and other ground work. We might be able to grab some of his new adjuster styles for example
2016-10-18T15:25:30 <michelled> that would be great. perhaps cherry picking some of his commits?
2016-10-18T15:28:19 <Justin_o> michelled: perhaps, if that\'s possible, or I\'ll see if there is another way to maintain his attribution

2016-10-18T18:07:36 <michelled> alanharnum, Bosmon, cindyli, Justin_o: Open Ed is on November 2nd and jessm will be showing off the UIO WP plugin and suggesting that people use it. It would be really great to have it updated to Infusion 2.0 by then. This means we should try to aim to cut the 2.0 release next week.
2016-10-18T18:07:47 <michelled> alanharnum, cindyli: we will likely have to help out with some testing next week :)
2016-10-18T18:08:02 <alanharnum> michelled: confirmed!
