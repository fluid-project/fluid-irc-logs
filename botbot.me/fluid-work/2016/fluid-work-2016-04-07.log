2016-04-07T18:53:57 <colinclark> simonjb: There is, but I\'m quite distracted
2016-04-07T18:54:03 <colinclark> and may have to dig it out of one of my compositions
2016-04-07T18:54:11 <simonjb> ok
2016-04-07T18:54:14 <colinclark> basically a model synth has a model containing a member "inputs"
2016-04-07T18:54:35 <colinclark> those correspond with inputs to the synth\'s unit generators
2016-04-07T18:54:41 <colinclark> so you\'ll have to give your oscillator an id
2016-04-07T18:54:43 <colinclark> "carrier" or whatever
2016-04-07T18:55:07 <colinclark> or "modulator"
2016-04-07T18:55:10 <colinclark> i guess in this case
2016-04-07T18:55:19 <colinclark> so the path you\'ll want is "modulator.freq"
2016-04-07T18:55:34 <colinclark> and the model synth represents this a kind of "mirror" of the hierarchy of the ugens
2016-04-07T18:55:46 <colinclark> i.e. model: { inputs: { modulator: { freq: 10
2016-04-07T18:56:36 <simonjb> colinclark: got it, and an update to the model will be reflected in the corresponding ugen property?
2016-04-07T18:59:01 <colinclark> yes
2016-04-07T18:59:04 <colinclark> correct

2016-04-07T19:07:09 <bens_> anyone familiar w/ the LGS (Library GPII System)? I\'m looking for what solutions its able to enact on windows.. and if there are any others than what is described here: https://github.com/sgithens/library-gpii-system/blob/master/lgs-station/lgs-solutions/win32.json
2016-04-07T19:08:16 <colinclark> sgithens is who you want to chat with, bens_. Doesn\'t look like he\'s here right now, but usually is.
2016-04-07T19:08:50 <bens_> hi colinclark, thanks... i\'ll look for him here
2016-04-07T19:10:02 <colinclark> Awesome. nice to see you back in the channel, bens_! I hope things are well with you.
2016-04-07T19:35:06 <simonjb> hey Bosmon, Bosmon7: is it possible to do a model relay with nested transforms? would we have any examples anywhere? thanks!
2016-04-07T19:35:26 <Bosmon7> simonjb - it might be barely possible
2016-04-07T19:35:35 <simonjb> :)
2016-04-07T19:35:37 <Bosmon7> But it has never, to my knowledge, been attempted and is not recommended
2016-04-07T19:35:51 <simonjb> ok, what is the recommended alternative?
2016-04-07T19:35:52 <Bosmon7> The "relay" idiom emphasises the use of multiple chained single transforms
2016-04-07T19:36:04 <Bosmon7> That is, single transforms each of which immediately hit a further concrete path in the model
2016-04-07T19:36:14 <Bosmon7> This is also more in keeping with our idiom of "universal addressibility"
2016-04-07T19:36:22 <simonjb> ok, got it
2016-04-07T19:36:38 <Bosmon7> In that the "interior" of the transform remains constantly addressible, making it easier to understand how to advise or modify the design
2016-04-07T19:36:56 <Bosmon7> This is the answer to the question I asked colinclark in the Linz streetcar in 2011 : P
2016-04-07T19:37:10 <simonjb> :)
2016-04-07T19:37:16 <simonjb> thanks Bosmon7
2016-04-07T19:37:44 <Bosmon7> Which is.... "How can we ensure that all the interior points of a complex model transformation continue to have names?"
2016-04-07T19:37:50 <Bosmon7> The answer is.... "By simply doing it" : P
2016-04-07T19:38:20 <Bosmon7> We spent some time building up the theory and implementation of nested transforms with kasparne_ at the beginning, but the result has never been very usable and comprehensible
2016-04-07T19:38:29 <Bosmon7> But it\'s something you are forced to when your transform is a "one-shot deal"
2016-04-07T19:38:33 <Bosmon7> As all our original transforms wer
2016-04-07T19:38:45 <Bosmon7> That is, a process with a single, well-defined input and a single, well-defined output
2016-04-07T19:38:52 <Bosmon7> But avoiding casting the process in that way is the key to escape
2016-04-07T19:40:44 * cindyli joined the channel
2016-04-07T19:42:53 <simonjb> thanks Bosmon7, am I right in thinking that we don\'t have an abs transform?
2016-04-07T19:43:41 <simonjb> ultimately I want: model.a = abs(model.b) / x
2016-04-07T19:44:19 <Bosmon7> simonjb - any existing pure one-arg function can just be used directly as a transform, including Math.abs
2016-04-07T19:44:41 <Bosmon7> The case you\'re dealing with there will eventually be handled by our "reduced expression parser"
2016-04-07T19:45:16 <simonjb> as in singleTransform: { type: "Math.abs" }
2016-04-07T19:45:51 <simonjb> Bosmon7: ^
2016-04-07T19:46:16 <simonjb> ?
2016-04-07T19:46:20 <Bosmon7> To be honest, the case is simple enough that it might be worth just trying to use a nested transform...........
2016-04-07T19:46:24 <Bosmon7> simonjb, yes, like that
2016-04-07T19:46:48 <simonjb> Bosmon7: I was trying but couldn\'t seem to get it right
2016-04-07T19:48:38 <simonjb> Using the named interior values approach is fine
2016-04-07T19:49:28 <simonjb> and I think I only need one extra named value -- the abs result
2016-04-07T19:50:20 <Bosmon7> simonjb - the example I can find here is this: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/tests/framework-tests/core/js/DataBindingTests.js#L1159
2016-04-07T19:50:36 <Bosmon7> You need to use the more verbose "transform" member rather than "singleTransform"
2016-04-07T19:50:51 <Bosmon7> But yes, the chained method is reasonable

2016-04-07T13:20:40 <PaliwalSparsh> @Justin_o I added the aria-disabled attribute by making changes in pager.js but I am not able to get enough info on how to write css for focus using keyboard. I tried searching it but was unsuccessfull can you help.
2016-04-07T13:21:24 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: you\'d do that in JS too, but I believe it was recommended to not remove focus from the disabled link.. so you should be okay
2016-04-07T13:21:59 <PaliwalSparsh> @Justin_o so do i need to make that change

2016-04-07T13:24:50 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: you mean how there should still be focus styling for the current page link
2016-04-07T13:25:04 <Justin_o> so that\'s like hover, you\'d use the :focus pseudo selector
2016-04-07T13:25:57 <PaliwalSparsh> Justin_o: I will try it then. Actually I thought that would be different from normal focus.
2016-04-07T13:26:17 <Justin_o> what do you mean by normal focus?
2016-04-07T13:26:45 <PaliwalSparsh> One when we use mouse and one when we use tab to navigate through webpage
2016-04-07T13:27:07 <PaliwalSparsh> we cannot focus with mouse on a link
2016-04-07T13:27:36 <cindyli> the-t-in-rtf: i wonder if you have some time to meet to talk about user management system?
2016-04-07T13:28:03 <PaliwalSparsh> @Justin_o ^
2016-04-07T13:28:48 <cindyli> the-t-in-rtf: it doesn\'t have to be now, we can schedule a time that works for you
2016-04-07T13:28:56 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: the :focus pseudo selector should cover the case where an element is focused using either the keyboard or mouse
2016-04-07T13:29:23 <PaliwalSparsh> @Justin_o great I will make the change and push the PR then.
2016-04-07T13:29:32 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: thanks

2016-04-07T13:29:57 <the-t-in-rtf> Hi, @cindyli.  I\'d like to keep Antranig involved.  My schedule is a bit more open than his, I am generally available until 18:00 CET.
2016-04-07T13:30:07 <the-t-in-rtf> See if you can find a time early next week that works for him.
2016-04-07T13:30:09 <PaliwalSparsh> Justin_o ok

2016-04-07T13:33:13 <cindyli> Bosmon, Bosmon8, can i schedule a time with you and the-t-in-rtf to talk about user management system? in particular, the ways to make use of gpii-express-user in universal repo to accommodate the functionalities we currently have with OAuth login and privacy setting.

2016-04-07T18:03:20 <simonjb> colinclark: I think I have a simple tremolo working (added mul: { ugen: "flock.ugen.sinOsc" ... }) to synthDef
2016-04-07T18:03:37 <simonjb> but not sure how to hook up sinOsc freq to model changes
2016-04-07T18:04:10 <simonjb> is there an example I could follow?
