b'2016-05-31T17:09:15 <Dinuka> which is a test data
2016-05-31T17:09:34 <Dinuka> would there be any instance where it is reusable
2016-05-31T17:09:48 * kasparne_ has quit
2016-05-31T17:10:57 <Dinuka> lets say, this function has been used in 10 places. In that case, I think we should not have separated these parameters to external variables
2016-05-31T17:11:40 <Justin_o> Dinuka: the reuse would be for this file or others that might want to extend or make use of the same test fixtures
2016-05-31T17:12:43 <Dinuka> yes, but, I think the list of page sizes is more specific to the test case.
2016-05-31T17:14:37 <Dinuka> fluid.tests.tooltipModuleSource takes that parameter and change the page size to each and verify the behavior of tooltips
2016-05-31T17:15:15 * wale joined the channel
2016-05-31T17:15:23 <Dinuka> so, I think that parameter is not a general thing
2016-05-31T17:15:44 <Dinuka> am I wrong
2016-05-31T17:16:30 <wale> @colinclark
2016-05-31T17:16:33 <wale> there?
2016-05-31T17:16:50 <colinclark> hey wale!
2016-05-31T17:16:53 <colinclark> I\'m here, yes
2016-05-31T17:19:42 <wale> understand you have an inquiry
2016-05-31T17:19:49 <wale> skype, maybe?
2016-05-31T17:21:08 <colinclark> inquiry? I\'m confused, wale :)
2016-05-31T17:21:46 <wale> Karen said to ping you that you wanted to chat with me about something you needed help with
2016-05-31T17:23:35 <colinclark> oh, strange
2016-05-31T17:23:43 <colinclark> I can\'t think of anything in particular
2016-05-31T17:24:01 <colinclark> I wonder what it could have been, wale?
2016-05-31T17:24:03 <colinclark> Trying to think
2016-05-31T17:24:15 <wale> k .. going to ping her real quick
2016-05-31T17:25:06 <Justin_o> Dinuka: it still useful to be accessible from the global namespace, and would help with readability. You could just define the variable before the fluid.defaults call... another option would be to add it in a testOptions block in the fluid.tests.pagerTooltipEnv but i think it would be easy enough to just make the variable.
2016-05-31T17:28:15 <Dinuka> yes, adding it to the testOptions make sense
2016-05-31T17:28:20 <Dinuka> thanks Justin_o
2016-05-31T17:30:56 <Dinuka> Justin_o: I updated that

2016-05-31T18:06:11 <Bosmon> Hey alanharnum - I have a fix for your iframe issue here, but I\'d like to see us having a dedicated unit test for diagnosing this issue
2016-05-31T18:06:13 <Bosmon> https://github.com/waharnum/infusion/pull/2
2016-05-31T18:06:36 * lliskovoi has quit
2016-05-31T18:06:58 <alanharnum> Bosmon: sure - i\'ll look into that. At minimum it should be part of the manual test suite.
2016-05-31T18:07:17 <Bosmon> alanharnum - awesome!
2016-05-31T18:08:23 <alanharnum> Bosmon: can I ask you a question about dynamic grades while I\'ve got you here?
2016-05-31T18:09:17 <Bosmon> alanharnum - sure
2016-05-31T18:14:42 <alanharnum> Bosmon: sorry, did a quick gist that will hopefully make the issue I\'m seeing clearer: https://gist.github.com/waharnum/8c1abcbec3f9786c899f9e6637564c8c
2016-05-31T18:15:29 <alanharnum> basically, I want to be able to set the model of each dynamic component based on the row.doc argument of the event signature
2016-05-31T18:16:35 <alanharnum> my expectation was that this should simply work, but the framework appears to interpret "{arguments}.0" as an implicit relay reference rather than a reference to the arguments passed when the event is fired
2016-05-31T18:16:51 * PaliwalSparsh joined the channel
2016-05-31T18:17:49 <Bosmon> alanharnum - that\'s true, yes
2016-05-31T18:18:01 <alanharnum> is there a way to convey to the framework that I want the model of the dynamic component to be set based on a POJO passed to the event?
2016-05-31T18:18:16 <alanharnum> I tried a few other things like expanders, etc, couldn\'t find an approach that worked
2016-05-31T18:18:49 <alanharnum> if I use "{arguments}.0" outside the model block, like in the example at http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/SubcomponentDeclaration.html#dynamic-subcomponents-with-a-source-event, it behaves as expected
2016-05-31T18:21:14 <wale> @simonjb
2016-05-31T18:21:33 <simonjb> hi there wale
2016-05-31T18:21:38 <wale> the "Bearer token" I\'ve got this https://wiki.gpii.net/w/GPII_Deployment_Structures
2016-05-31T18:21:48 <wale> do you have anything else?
2016-05-31T18:22:09 <Bosmon> alanharnum - I would say that this is a bug, yes
2016-05-31T18:22:33 <Bosmon> What I would do as a workaround is to put your {arguments}.0 reference in a plain options area and then refer to that from the model
2016-05-31T18:22:38 <Bosmon> And please write this up as a JIRA :)
2016-05-31T18:23:33 * clown has quit
2016-05-31T18:24:40 <alanharnum> Bosmon: thanks, that workaround has done it
2016-05-31T18:24:43 <alanharnum> i\'ll file a JIRA
2016-05-31T18:25:48 <simonjb> wale: we\'ve got an entry on https://wiki.gpii.net/w/GPII_Security_Plan \'Design "Anonymous" usage\' but I don\'t think we have more than that -- cindyli1 am I mssing anything else that you can think of on "bearer token"?

2016-05-31T18:27:53 <gtirloni> Bosmon: is that enactor test, remember.. i don\'t remember what\'s the issue but i think there\'s a jira for it. nothing new though
