2016-08-18T13:06:53 <PaliwalSparsh> Justin_o: Hi, Should we have the backpack in the game during the time when a user is in the screens that popup when they select things like aisle or newspaper or the notes stand where they select preferences for that room.
2016-08-18T13:07:26 * Jess_ joined the channel
2016-08-18T13:08:00 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: hmm.. good question. I think it might be a good idea, in case they need to make some other adjustment to make use of those screens
2016-08-18T13:10:04 <PaliwalSparsh> dont know on normal screens cat will sit down
2016-08-18T13:10:36 <PaliwalSparsh> what to do there for showing that focus is on backpack
2016-08-18T13:12:02 <PaliwalSparsh> Justin_o: ^
2016-08-18T13:16:16 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: ah.. well in those screens you have the focus highlight on the arrows i believe, so you could remove that focus highlight and only have the focus highlight on the item in the backpack
2016-08-18T13:17:09 <PaliwalSparsh> Justin_o: Thanks I will try if I can make this work for sure.

2016-08-18T15:42:40 <Bosmon7> The layout looks interesting - could you flesh out a few details on what you expect the workflow to be for someone who installs using npm/grunt etc?
2016-08-18T15:44:38 <alanharn_> Bosmon7: sure, will do later this aft
2016-08-18T15:45:03 <Bosmon7> alanharn_ - awesome!

2016-08-18T16:33:22 <godfrey_> Hi Jess_: One of our professors from U of T emailed TPark and I in regards to a project she is working on with March of Dimes. She was wondering if the IDRC has ever been involved in any March of Dimes Programs
2016-08-18T16:34:41 <Jess_> godfrey_: good question \xe2\x80\x94 i don\xe2\x80\x99t know of any, but perhaps some who have been around longer will. And I think it might be good to look into if ocad itself has. TPark you were also going to pass along some information for an instructor who might be interested and have some ideas about that accessible bathroom?
2016-08-18T16:36:48 <TPark> Jess_: godfrey_ has the information regarding the instructor
2016-08-18T16:37:41 <TPark> Jess_: on a separate note, did you have a chance to find those emails from the Toronto District School Board teacher who is interested in collaborating with the IDRC?
2016-08-18T16:37:41 * kavya joined the channel
2016-08-18T16:38:27 <Jess_> TPark: ah, yes! knew I was forgetting something. jobara and i are going to fill out a survey together tomorrow a.m. \xe2\x80\x94 if you want to join us for that you\xe2\x80\x99re of course welcome
2016-08-18T16:38:35 <Jess_> i\xe2\x80\x99ll also forward the emails
2016-08-18T16:40:22 <TPark> Jess_: Thank you. And yes I would be interested in joining you for that
2016-08-18T16:40:45 <godfrey_> Hi Jess_: The instructor name is Alex Mihailidis http://www.iatsl.org/people/amihailidis.htm
2016-08-18T16:45:29 <godfrey_> Jess_: Here's also an old article in regards to the smart washroom https://www.thestar.com/life/health_wellness/2008/09/01/u_of_ts_talking_washroom_guy.html Hope it helps!
2016-08-18T16:46:18 <Jess_> godfrey_: thanks! awesome
2016-08-18T16:46:56 <Jess_> TPark: we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do it remotely, and i think it\xe2\x80\x99ll be morningtime \xe2\x80\x94 we don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific time yet, but I\xe2\x80\x99m imagining 9-10ish start
2016-08-18T16:50:40 <TPark> Jess_: okay. that works for me. I'm guessing it will be in the standup room?
2016-08-18T16:51:03 <Jess_> good guess. i\xe2\x80\x99ll finalize with justin when he\xe2\x80\x99s online again
