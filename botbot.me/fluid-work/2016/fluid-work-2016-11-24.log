2016-11-24T16:50:18 <colinclark> aren\'t those really the same use case, though?

2016-11-24T09:48:27 <kasparnet> morning stegru
2016-11-24T09:49:02 <kasparnet> I\'m looking at michelles tasktray work and am getting an error with one of the windows tests (different stuff than I was whining about in the channel yesterday)
2016-11-24T09:49:23 <kasparnet> The process handling test fails because it cannot find the test-window.exe
2016-11-24T09:49:35 <kasparnet> which is fair enough since it doesn\'t exist
2016-11-24T09:50:31 <kasparnet> I can see the source code for it, but not where it is actually is supposed to be built
2016-11-24T09:53:01 <stegru> i don\'t know either - i\'ll see if i can work it out
2016-11-24T09:54:32 <stegru> oh - i thought you where talking about something different
2016-11-24T09:54:44 <stegru> the build is in the provision directory...
2016-11-24T09:55:45 <stegru> https://github.com/GPII/windows/blob/master/provisioning/Build.ps1#L35
2016-11-24T09:56:34 <kasparnet> oooh nice
2016-11-24T09:56:37 <kasparnet> thanks stegru
2016-11-24T09:58:20 <stegru> to be honest, I don\'t really like the way the test relies on this extra build process - but I couldn\'t think of another way of testing what I was testing

2016-11-24T15:38:55 <michelled> honestly, cindyli, I just wanted to catch up after your security planning meeting that I missed :)
2016-11-24T15:39:41 <michelled> cindyli: I think we should update this page - I\'m happy to help if it\'s useful: https://wiki.gpii.net/w/GPII_Security_Plan
2016-11-24T15:40:46 * simonjb joined the channel
2016-11-24T15:40:55 <michelled> let\'s make it so the page gives a clear indication of what is happening in what order
2016-11-24T15:42:58 <cindyli> the last security planning meeting was trying to figure out use cases on how the preferences are accessed so we can come up with ideas of how to protect the preferences server. there\'s not yet technical plans laid out from that meeting. i\'ve put the meeting notes on the security dashboard: https://pad.gpii.net/p/how-to-protect-the-preferences-server-hy124npc
2016-11-24T15:43:49 <cindyli> michelled: so i think our next security goal is to protect the prefs server
2016-11-24T15:44:36 <cindyli> at the moment, i\'m creating diagrams of our authorization work flows for some use cases
2016-11-24T15:47:16 <michelled> oh, that\'s great
2016-11-24T15:47:24 <michelled> diagrams help so much cindyli :)

2016-11-24T16:11:45 <colinclark> Justin_o: You\'ve used sinon for mocks in the past, right?
2016-11-24T16:12:15 <Justin_o> colinclark: yes, i have..
2016-11-24T16:12:26 <colinclark> What kinds of things have you used it for?
2016-11-24T16:12:45 <colinclark> and what do you think its strengths are, particularly in relation to testing Infusion components?
2016-11-24T16:12:56 * the-t-in-rtf has quit
2016-11-24T16:13:41 <Justin_o> colinclark: it\'s particularly good for when accessing features of the browser that we might want to mock out.. e.g. it would be good for the text-to-speech.. and i guess similarly for other third party abstractions
2016-11-24T16:14:29 <Justin_o> colinclark: it can also be used to test ajax although i haven\'t done much experimentation with that, so we could potentially remove mockjax
2016-11-24T16:14:38 * gtirloni has quit
2016-11-24T16:15:10 <colinclark> So does it generate stubs for a particular interface or something, Justin_o?
2016-11-24T16:15:25 <colinclark> is that why it\'s good for testing third party abstractions?
2016-11-24T16:15:59 <colinclark> and how often did you find yourself writing asserts against particular spies being called and their arguments, etc?
2016-11-24T16:16:31 <Justin_o> colinclark: so i used it for the fluid-publish module\'s tests. https://github.com/fluid-project/fluid-publish/blob/master/tests/publishTests.js
2016-11-24T16:16:57 <Justin_o> so that w could stub out things like calls to log and execSync
2016-11-24T16:17:00 <colinclark> So Sinon doesn\'t provide this out of the box? https://github.com/fluid-project/fluid-publish/blob/master/tests/publishTests.js#L18-L30
2016-11-24T16:17:04 <colinclark> that\'s interesting
2016-11-24T16:17:05 <Justin_o> as we didn\'t want those actually running in the test
2016-11-24T16:17:33 <colinclark> right
2016-11-24T16:17:39 <Justin_o> colinclark: i don\'t think in batches like that
2016-11-24T16:17:51 <Justin_o> and you may want to configure things independently at times
2016-11-24T16:18:37 <colinclark> I\'m trying to think through the value of this kind of low-level, white box unit testing with mocks
2016-11-24T16:18:48 <colinclark> versus the larger-scale mocks that you see in, say, the GPII
2016-11-24T16:18:57 <Justin_o> ah, i\'m not sure what those look like
2016-11-24T16:19:09 <colinclark> you should have a look some time
2016-11-24T16:19:25 <Justin_o> colinclark: but thinking back to what i wrote for text-to-speech i would have rather used sinon
2016-11-24T16:19:34 <colinclark> how come
2016-11-24T16:19:35 <colinclark> ?
2016-11-24T16:19:39 <Justin_o> colinclark: can you send me a link to an example
2016-11-24T16:20:40 <colinclark> There are a whole set of mock settings handlers in the GPII
2016-11-24T16:20:50 <colinclark> including ones in the journalling tests that intentionally explode :)
2016-11-24T16:21:20 <colinclark> I guess there are times when you really do want to be able to verify that you\'ve bound to, say, a browser API correctly
2016-11-24T16:21:26 <Justin_o> colinclark:  here\'s the mock i created to go along with TTS https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/components/textToSpeech/js/MockTTS.js
2016-11-24T16:21:36 <colinclark> but it\'s a funny kind of "glue" testing
2016-11-24T16:22:07 <colinclark> ah yes
2016-11-24T16:22:26 <colinclark> I remember writing something like this years ago, long before we had much in the way of infrastructure in Infusion
2016-11-24T16:22:35 <colinclark> A think that records event sequences
2016-11-24T16:22:46 <Justin_o> so a couple things 1) we have to maintain it, 2) i think it\'s strange to ship the mock in source, but we do that to help others test. But i think an example of how to do the testing with Sinon would have been enough.
2016-11-24T16:24:09 <colinclark> It seems to me that a generic implementation of something like this would be very useful
2016-11-24T16:24:15 <colinclark> and in some ways more so than Sinon, no?
2016-11-24T16:24:56 <Justin_o> colinclark: in regards to your previous comment, yes there are different levels of testing, so there are test for the TTS itself that require actually accessing the real APIs and i think we\'ll want to do that for sure, but in other tests it may not be necessary
2016-11-24T16:25:08 <Justin_o> colinclark: not sure what you mean
2016-11-24T16:25:30 <colinclark> Well, it seems to me that your mock text to speech component takes something into account that Sinon does not
2016-11-24T16:25:36 <colinclark> which is sequencing
2016-11-24T16:25:58 <colinclark> enabling you to assert that a particular flow of events occurred as you expect it to

2016-11-24T16:26:27 <Justin_o> colinclark: i guess it depends on what you\'re looking for, but you can assert that a certain call was exectuted in a particular way
2016-11-24T16:26:36 <colinclark> a single call, right?
2016-11-24T16:26:39 <Justin_o> yes
2016-11-24T16:26:42 <colinclark> like with particular arguments or whatever
2016-11-24T16:26:48 <Justin_o> yes
2016-11-24T16:27:16 <Justin_o> colinclark: stub.onCall(n);
2016-11-24T16:27:22 <Justin_o> too bad i can\'t link to the docs directly
2016-11-24T16:27:27 <Justin_o> from http://sinonjs.org/docs/
2016-11-24T16:27:32 <colinclark> yes, I have them open
2016-11-24T16:28:23 <Justin_o> and also, i don\'t think sinon would replace our testing infrastructure, but i could imagine it could be useful to use in some cases as part of assertions and other things
2016-11-24T16:28:30 <colinclark> yes
2016-11-24T16:28:49 <Justin_o> and perhaps as being used to stub out portions within an IoC test
2016-11-24T16:29:01 <colinclark> The most interesting thing about Sinon to me is its support for mocking time :)
2016-11-24T16:29:03 <Justin_o> IoC Testing framework test
2016-11-24T16:29:42 <Justin_o> colinclark:  you mean http://sinonjs.org/docs/#clock-api
2016-11-24T16:29:49 <colinclark> yes
2016-11-24T16:30:25 <colinclark> Although, even those aren\'t really super sufficient
2016-11-24T16:30:40 <colinclark> since they don\'t also include a mock for requestAnimationFrame
2016-11-24T16:31:01 * clown has quit
2016-11-24T16:31:05 <colinclark> and in Bergson, my scheduler, I was able to create similar kinds of effects for testing without mocks at all
2016-11-24T16:31:18 <colinclark> and at a higher level of abstraction
2016-11-24T16:31:41 <colinclark> I guess you can imagine Sinon slotting in at a particular level of, as I said earlier, "glue testing"
2016-11-24T16:31:42 <Justin_o> colinclark: i haven\'t made use of that feature before, so not sure how good it is
