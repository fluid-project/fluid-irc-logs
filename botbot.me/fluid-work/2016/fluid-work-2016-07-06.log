2016-07-06T17:17:48 <danayo> hello jacquelinegullio !
2016-07-06T17:18:02 <jacquelinegullio> hellooo fluid people. I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to use your http://achecker.ca/checker/index.php & I\xe2\x80\x99ve hit a problem
2016-07-06T17:18:35 <danayo> cindyli: jacquelinegullio is the person I refered to above
2016-07-06T17:19:23 <jacquelinegullio> Hi. I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to verify a web app (which is behind a firewall), so we are uploading one of our HTML files.
2016-07-06T17:20:23 <jacquelinegullio> Using chrome, we get a standard 500 error page. Any advice on what we should expect?
2016-07-06T17:21:15 <jacquelinegullio> Your app comes highly recommended so i\xe2\x80\x99d like to be able to use it :)
2016-07-06T17:24:25 <danayo> fluid-everyone: can anyone assist jacquelinegullio with this achecker problem? (looks like cindyli has gone offline ...)
2016-07-06T17:25:16 <Jess_> danayo: jacquelinegullio: if not now, someone will be able to eventually. you\xe2\x80\x99re right, cindyli is the one to ask\xe2\x80\xa6

2016-07-06T17:55:27 <gtirloni> jacquelinegullio, hi. could you try uploading the file now so we can capture the error so cindyli can check it later?
2016-07-06T17:55:35 <jacquelinegullio> ok sure
2016-07-06T17:57:22 <jacquelinegullio> it was data-aquariusportal
2016-07-06T17:57:41 <gtirloni> ok thanks. how big is the html file?
2016-07-06T17:57:45 <gtirloni> (file size)
2016-07-06T18:01:08 <gtirloni> jacquelinegullio, i've adjusted some settings in the server that could help with your issue. could you try again?
2016-07-06T18:01:16 <jacquelinegullio> oh super
2016-07-06T18:03:03 <jacquelinegullio> now i have a gateway time out

2016-07-06T18:05:51 <jacquelinegullio> k thanks for checking.
2016-07-06T18:05:56 <jacquelinegullio> standing by for Cindy

2016-07-06T18:21:35 <cindyli> hi jacquelinegullio, sorry i was away. did you try to upload a file then validate? was trying that but didn't produce the error. if the file content is not sensible, can u paste it into http://pastebin.com/ and send me the pastebin link?
2016-07-06T18:22:33 <jacquelinegullio> I was trying to upload the file & got a timeout.
2016-07-06T18:22:44 <jacquelinegullio> I\xe2\x80\x99ll try the pastebin
2016-07-06T18:22:55 <cindyli> jacquelinegullio: how big is the file
2016-07-06T18:23:30 <jacquelinegullio> it\xe2\x80\x99s 326 kb (without all its supporting files)
2016-07-06T18:24:24 <cindyli> ok, not huge

2016-07-06T18:25:13 <cindyli> jacquelinegullio: try a couple of other files in different sizes and see how it goes

2016-07-06T18:27:34 <jacquelinegullio> Our app is all in one page
2016-07-06T18:27:55 <cindyli> got a 502 error with your file
2016-07-06T18:28:08 <jacquelinegullio> ?

2016-07-06T18:29:42 <jacquelinegullio> Also it is not true that our app is all in one page. sorry about that.I\xe2\x80\x99m trying another page now
2016-07-06T18:29:50 <cindyli> i mean i can reproduce a similar error with your file, jacquelinegullio

2016-07-06T18:37:11 <jacquelinegullio> @cindyli. Looking at our site, I can see some strange behaviour with the URLs. I think I found a work around by exporting from each subURL. I\xe2\x80\x99ve now submitted several files & achecker seems to process them.
2016-07-06T18:37:19 <jacquelinegullio> maybe my problem is resolved. thanks
2016-07-06T18:38:50 <cindyli> no problem, have fun with achecker, jacquelinegullio
2016-07-06T18:39:23 <cindyli> btw, the validation on the first file hits memory then time limit. seems it's too complicated for achecker to process, jacquelinegullio ;)
2016-07-06T18:39:31 <jacquelinegullio> yeah. ok

2016-07-06T13:22:36 <cindyli> Justin_o: looking at ur pull request. wondering why moving the position of where "value" attribute gets set would fix the issue? anything special with setting range input attributes?
2016-07-06T13:26:30 <Justin_o> cindyli: i\'m guessing it has to do with the ordering of properties of objects in Firefox, combined with the jQuery  iterating over the object to set the attributes of the DOM element. So if we set the value before we know the type and range it has, it gets confused and just sticks it at one of the extremes
2016-07-06T13:27:29 <cindyli> Justin_o: thanks. interesting that the order of properties in one object does matter sometimes.
2016-07-06T13:29:05 <DinukaDeSilva> Justin_o: I just added another comment in the pull request

2016-07-06T14:55:36 <clown> I pushed the stuff here: https://github.com/klown/windows/commit/2b8ccf274b0f7d7e30b1cce8cd01af0ff2c57ab7
2016-07-06T14:55:50 <jhernandez> oh, sweet
2016-07-06T14:56:13 <clown> the effort was to try and get a handle on the threads of a process to see if that would tell me more about the status thereof.
2016-07-06T14:56:16 <clown> but, it doesn\'t work :-(
2016-07-06T14:56:40 <jhernandez> oh, really?
2016-07-06T14:56:54 <jhernandez> any ideas of why it isn\'t working?
2016-07-06T14:57:03 <clown> I get no threads.  I don\'t know why.
2016-07-06T14:57:12 <clown> or, I don\'t know why not.
2016-07-06T14:57:54 <clown> This line gives a result of "null":  https://github.com/klown/windows/commit/2b8ccf274b0f7d7e30b1cce8cd01af0ff2c57ab7#diff-0882b7bae0c09d688357ca55d4e5e9b8R73
2016-07-06T14:58:15 <clown> so the loop immediately after does nothing.
2016-07-06T14:58:25 <clown> but it doesn\'t fail with an exception.
2016-07-06T14:59:45 <jhernandez> mm, I have to run into a meeting right now, I can probably give it a try after the arch meeting
2016-07-06T15:00:44 <clown> cool!

2016-07-06T15:00:55 <clown> yes.
2016-07-06T15:00:59 <jhernandez> okay

2016-07-06T15:02:09 <michelled> cindyli, are you available to join a meeting right now?
2016-07-06T15:02:19 <clown> btw, I\'m using the code in your GPII-1826 branch (that fixes the unit tests), jhernandez
2016-07-06T15:02:19 <michelled> we are going to go throught the set up accounts stuff
2016-07-06T15:02:58 <clown> but, I\'m not sure that is the right branch from *this* PR work.  It will do for now, until I/we get something working.
2016-07-06T15:03:25 <cindyli> yes, michelled
2016-07-06T15:03:34 <cindyli> where is it

2016-07-06T15:59:43 <clown> One was not using the pid (https://github.com/klown/windows/commit/2b8ccf274b0f7d7e30b1cce8cd01af0ff2c57ab7#diff-0882b7bae0c09d688357ca55d4e5e9b8R73).
2016-07-06T15:59:49 <jhernandez> bugs everywhere!
2016-07-06T16:00:45 <clown> The other was not defining TH32CS_SNAPTHREAD properly in WindowsUtilities.js (https://github.com/klown/windows/commit/2b8ccf274b0f7d7e30b1cce8cd01af0ff2c57ab7#diff-0882b7bae0c09d688357ca55d4e5e9b8R70)
