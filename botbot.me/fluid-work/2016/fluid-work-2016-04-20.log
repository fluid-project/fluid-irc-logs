2016-04-20T13:51:44 <jhung> michelled: I\'m in the process of compiling resources for Hewlett and realized that there\'s enough information to make a decent guide. Initially I was thinking it\'d be something for the ILDH, but now I think it may actually be better on the (redesigned) IDRC site.

2016-04-20T15:36:41 <clown> good day jhernandez.  I just pushed the latest xrandr add-on changes to my branch.  You can pull them if you want.
2016-04-20T15:36:58 <jhernandez> clown: morning!
2016-04-20T15:36:59 <jhernandez> yay!!
2016-04-20T15:37:04 <clown> well\xe2\x80\xa6
2016-04-20T15:37:47 <clown> I\'m seeing some cruft in that code, and I may want to create issues for them.
2016-04-20T15:38:55 <clown> but, in terms of porting to nan, I think this is done (pending your and Bosmon\'s further comments).
2016-04-20T15:40:42 <jhernandez> I see
2016-04-20T15:42:31 <jhernandez> well, it\'s true that the code is far from being the best xrandr wrapper but it actually does the work though
2016-04-20T15:43:49 <clown> yes, but one of the things I just fixed was a potential seg fault due to a null pointer.  That condition luckily never happened so we didn\'t see it.
2016-04-20T15:43:57 <clown> It makes me wonder what other surprises are lurking there.
2016-04-20T15:45:34 <clown> Also, the wrapper always gets the default X display for all the configuration.  That might be okay.  Do all gpii installations have only one display?
2016-04-20T15:45:46 * clown worries too much.
2016-04-20T15:52:27 * the-t-in-rtf joined the channel
2016-04-20T15:58:06 <clown> btw, jhernandez, in the process I *think* I\'ve figured out how to get the display physcial size from X.
2016-04-20T15:58:21 <clown> I would still like to see the code you mentioned last week though.
2016-04-20T15:59:33 <jhernandez> wrt the potential segfault, thanks for taking care of it
2016-04-20T16:00:06 * dsharma_ has quit
2016-04-20T16:00:14 <clown> my pleasure \xe2\x80\x94 it\'s one way to learn how this stuff works.
2016-04-20T16:00:37 <jhernandez> wrt the unique display, right, I didn\'t go that far when writing it for the first time, so it should be great to handle multiple displays
2016-04-20T16:00:46 <the-t-in-rtf> architecture meeting is now....
2016-04-20T16:02:22 <jhernandez> clown: wrt physical size, I forgot searching for that code, will do it later, it must be somewhere on my backup
2016-04-20T16:02:38 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2016-04-20T16:03:31 <clown> no problem jhernandez re:  physcial size code.  whenever you get a chance, that\'s fine.
2016-04-20T16:03:41 * clown is late for an arch meeting.  horrors.
2016-04-20T16:04:00 * alanharn_ joined the channel
2016-04-20T16:04:58 <jhernandez> but yeah, IIRC, it was a matter of asking for more properties from "sizes", which is a XRRScreenSize struct
2016-04-20T16:16:32 <clown> yes, XRRScreenSize sounds familiar.

2016-04-20T18:17:17 <jhernandez> clown_mtg: ok, found the way to obtain the real physical size of the display
2016-04-20T18:17:41 <clown_mtg> jhernandez, you are the bomb.
2016-04-20T18:17:55 <jhernandez> I remember it was easy (once you find the right function)
2016-04-20T18:18:14 <clown> did you catch cold looking for the right function?  or something worse?
2016-04-20T18:18:40 <jhernandez> it\'s as easy as calling XDisplayWidthMM/XDisplayHeightMM with their corresponding arguments
2016-04-20T18:19:24 * clown looks at X documentation
2016-04-20T18:19:25 <jhernandez> hahaha
2016-04-20T18:19:51 <jhernandez> nope, I survived
2016-04-20T18:19:57 <jhernandez> :)
2016-04-20T18:23:24 <jhernandez> it\'s well known that, depending on the driver, you might get non-accurate values on certain hw, but the deviation is *almost* innapreciable I\'d say
2016-04-20T18:23:34 <clown> the one doc I found says you need the Display and the screen number (int), which we have already.
