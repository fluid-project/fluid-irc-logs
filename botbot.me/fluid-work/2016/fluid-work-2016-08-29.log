2016-08-29T14:30:40 <cindyli> correct?
2016-08-29T14:36:40 <PaliwalSparsh> Hi everyone do we have any project based on node.js ?
2016-08-29T14:39:05 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: probably a bunch these days... there are a few build related tools we use for infusion (e.g. https://github.com/fluid-project/grunt-modulefiles and https://github.com/fluid-project/fluid-publish) and GPII has lots https://github.com/gpii
2016-08-29T14:39:09 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: why do you ask?
2016-08-29T14:43:21 <PaliwalSparsh> Justin_o: Actually past few days I have spent learning node.js so thought it would be great to make it of some use.
2016-08-29T14:44:04 <PaliwalSparsh> Also that way would get to learn it better
2016-08-29T14:45:45 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: if you are looking for something to work on, perhaps michelled or Bosmon might know of something GPII related.
2016-08-29T14:47:04 <PaliwalSparsh> Justin_o: Thanks I will look at these projects and then talk to them :)

2016-08-29T15:34:42 <cindyli> in terms of resetting the pouch db, instead of re-issuing createOnEvent on the pouch.harness, i\'m thinking to call cleanUp, then call initDBs at onCleanupComplete. do you think this would work?
2016-08-29T15:37:40 * michelled has quit
2016-08-29T15:47:18 <Bosmon7> cindyli - that is right, yes
2016-08-29T15:47:31 <Bosmon7> I ran into this when writing tests for my journalling system for the GPII
2016-08-29T15:47:42 <cindyli> thanks, Bosmon7
2016-08-29T15:48:07 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - FLUID-5947 is definitely a 3.0 issue

2016-08-29T15:49:54 <Bosmon7> That of the **AIR QUALITY EGGGES**
2016-08-29T15:50:21 <Bosmon7> They\'re priced incredibly aggressively... I\'d been looking for ages for something usable at the "citizen science" level....
2016-08-29T15:50:28 <alanharnum> it\'s a rather interesting concept
2016-08-29T15:51:48 <Bosmon7> The NO2 monitors I found cost thousands
2016-08-29T15:58:44 <the-t-in-rtf> Sorry, @cindyli, I\'m already making dinner.

2016-08-29T16:27:50 <the-t-in-rtf> You could also post to the mailing list, I usually have time to respond to things like that in the morning.

2016-08-29T18:07:59 <kavya> Hi everyone..I am testing through LGS demo personas and running livia preference set and i installed NVDA on my VM which is up and running
2016-08-29T18:09:15 <kavya> on login with livia user token from browser,what is the expected behaviour?

2016-08-29T18:49:25 <michelled> hi kavya, looks to me like it should launch NVDA
2016-08-29T18:49:32 <michelled> is that what\'s happening?
2016-08-29T18:49:40 * stegru has quit
2016-08-29T18:53:57 <kavya> how to confirm that nvda is launched
2016-08-29T18:54:25 <kavya> i installed nvda by downloading it from web
2016-08-29T18:55:44 <michelled> I suspect that nvda should just start reading whatever is focused. javi would be a good person to check with
2016-08-29T18:57:16 <kavya> ok..in that case nvda is not launched.javi is not availble
2016-08-29T18:57:35 <kavya> i will check with kasper..thanks michelle
2016-08-29T19:21:37 <Justin_o> Bosmon: in regards to https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/729#discussion_r76112969, instead of a silent option, can i make it a verbose option?
2016-08-29T19:23:50 <Bosmon> Justin_o - sure
2016-08-29T19:23:56 <Justin_o> Bosmon: cool thanks
2016-08-29T19:24:23 <Justin_o> Bosmon: also, the default return value is only in the case of an error?
