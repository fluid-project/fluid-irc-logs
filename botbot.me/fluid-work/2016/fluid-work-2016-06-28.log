2016-06-28T18:04:22 <cindyli> yes, simonjb

2016-06-28T18:07:58 <simonjb> cindyli: and would I be correct in thinking that to switch between CouchDB and PouchDB, we set the URL? https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/GPII-1274/gpii/node_modules/gpii-oauth2/gpii-oauth2-datastore/src/DbDataStore.js#L45
2016-06-28T18:08:25 <simonjb> that both CouchDB and PouchDB are accessed through HTTP?
2016-06-28T18:09:06 <cindyli> yes, simonjb, "%baseUrl" points to where the db is
2016-06-28T18:10:12 <simonjb> thanks cindyli; and for https://github.com/fluid-project/metadata/blob/master/src/components/pouchDBDataSource/js/pouchDBDataSource.js
2016-06-28T18:10:12 * bens__ joined the channel
2016-06-28T18:10:26 <simonjb> the data access is through component invokers: get, set,...
2016-06-28T18:10:28 <simonjb> right?
2016-06-28T18:10:57 <cindyli> yes, simonjb
2016-06-28T18:11:29 <simonjb> ok, thanks cindyli! that helps to make sure I\'m understanding things

2016-06-28T19:45:47 <colinclark> never
2016-06-28T19:45:51 <colinclark> but i\'ll take a look :)
2016-06-28T19:46:07 <michelled> colinclark: is looks like you merged the pulls related to this JIRA, can I close it? https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-776

2016-06-28T19:46:10 <gtirloni> colinclark, thanks
2016-06-28T19:46:18 <colinclark> what\'s the motivation for the fix, gtirloni?
2016-06-28T19:46:21 <Bosmon> michelled - yes, GPII-412 can be closed
2016-06-28T19:46:52 <colinclark> michelled: I can\'t really say
2016-06-28T19:46:57 <gtirloni> colinclark, it\'s a bug in our jenkins config.. the tap report is not getting created because of it
2016-06-28T19:47:01 <colinclark> GPII-776 was indeed in Bosmon\'s mega branch
2016-06-28T19:47:08 <colinclark> but I don\'t know if the full scope of it was included
2016-06-28T19:47:14 <colinclark> gtirloni: ok
2016-06-28T19:47:50 <colinclark> done, gtirloni
2016-06-28T19:48:23 <gtirloni> colinclark, thanks. just confirmed it worked as expected.
2016-06-28T19:52:10 <colinclark> great
2016-06-28T20:06:57 <simonjb> Bosmon: Is the following a true statement? We currently do not have a Kettle data source implementation that uses PouchDB via object method calls (rather than via http calls to gpii-pouchdb)
2016-06-28T20:07:10 <Bosmon> simonjb - that\'s true
2016-06-28T20:07:15 <simonjb> awesome, thanks
2016-06-28T20:07:26 <Bosmon> I don\'t think we have any function call dataSources yet

2016-06-28T20:17:28 <cindyli> Bosmon: do fluid promise objects support chained then()? or fluid.promise.sequence() or fluid.promise.fireTransformEvent() are the ways to achieve chained then()?
2016-06-28T20:17:44 <cindyli> i was experimenting with this code snippet - http://pastebin.com/EGhvCqB9
2016-06-28T20:18:06 <cindyli> expecting the 2nd console log outputs {"a": "a", "b": "b"}
2016-06-28T20:18:17 <cindyli> but it outputs {"a":"a"}
2016-06-28T20:18:39 <cindyli> seems it ignores the further process in the first then() function
2016-06-28T20:19:27 <cindyli> did i do something wrong?
2016-06-28T20:19:40 <cindyli> or it\'s not supported in infusion?

2016-06-28T20:46:46 <Bosmon> cindyli - chained "then" will work but does not have the same semantic as in other libraries
2016-06-28T20:47:01 <Bosmon> Our "then" simply adds a further listener to the resolution list of the same promise
2016-06-28T20:47:10 <Bosmon> Whereas the "standard" semantic constructs a fresh promise every time
2016-06-28T20:47:18 <Bosmon> No, further processes are not supported in "then"
2016-06-28T20:47:33 <Bosmon> if you want to assemble a promise chain you need to do it explicitly using the methods you listed
2016-06-28T20:48:41 <Bosmon> cindyli - I think we had decided to use fluid.promise.fireTransformEvent() for your application?

2016-06-28T21:08:31 <cindyli> just curious about the chained then() which seems convenient that one function with a chained then() would handle all processing

2016-06-28T21:12:02 <bens__> anyone encountered issues with the windows 10 test vm related to windows firewall preventing winrm connections over a public network?

2016-06-28T21:14:02 * simonjb has quit
2016-06-28T21:14:35 <bens__> i am trying to run vagrant up for the vagrant file in this repo: https://github.com/GPII/windows. The VM boots but the winrm log in waits and the box is never provisioned. If, before the timeout occurs, I disable the windows firewall in the guest vm then the login succeeds a few seconds later.
2016-06-28T21:23:27 <gtirloni> bens__, never experience that. what\'s the host OS, vagrant/virtualbox version?
2016-06-28T21:23:57 <gtirloni> bens__, the network should be set to Private inside the guest
2016-06-28T21:24:53 <gtirloni> bens__, also, which box version do you have? `vagrant box list`
2016-06-28T21:36:54 <bens__> RHEL 7.2, Vagrant 1.8.4, Virtualbox 5.0.22. Vagrant box list output is "inclusivedesign/windows10-eval (virtualbox, 0.2.0)"

2016-06-28T15:36:59 <PaliwalSparsh> Hi please can anyone tell me are there only 2 standup meetings per week or more, the ones that I know are one for design critique(it\'s wiki was last updated in May so dont know if it is still there) and the other one is the Community workshop on wednesday(sure becuase I attended this last week).
2016-06-28T15:38:53 <danayo> PaliwalSparsh: we have what we call a "standup" meeting every day at 11:30ET where we each give a very brief update of our work. then there are the two open meetings that you describe - the design crit on Mondays at 1pm ET and the community meeting on Wednesdays at 2:30pm ET
2016-06-28T15:40:13 <PaliwalSparsh> I also once attended a meeting that was tech oriented, so I thought there was a third one. Maybe that would from one of these two or some extra meeting.
2016-06-28T15:40:21 <PaliwalSparsh> danayo ^
2016-06-28T15:41:00 <danayo> was it the architecture meeting PaliwalSparsh ?

2016-06-28T15:50:03 <PaliwalSparsh> thanks actually i was looking over the previous meeting topics on the wiki and they seemed to be quite interested.
2016-06-28T15:50:15 * clown joined the channel
2016-06-28T15:50:39 <danayo> it would be great to get feedback from the community, especially about some of the more challenging preference screens/rooms
2016-06-28T15:50:50 <danayo> and I could invite Jim as well
2016-06-28T15:51:17 <PaliwalSparsh> oh that would be good.
2016-06-28T15:51:47 <PaliwalSparsh> then we will discuss about this in the meeting today.
2016-06-28T15:51:55 <danayo> sounds good PaliwalSparsh
2016-06-28T15:52:08 <clown> jhernandez_:  Any reason we are not using the node-windows node package?  https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-windows
2016-06-28T15:52:23 <clown> Especially, this built-in function:  https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-windows#list
2016-06-28T15:52:38 <clown> that lists all the running processes?

2016-06-28T15:59:11 <clown> well, I see one possible reason \xe2\x80\x94 it\'s implemented by using exec() to execute a command line, jhernandez_

2016-06-28T15:59:58 <colinclark> clown: yes, I was going to say
2016-06-28T16:00:18 <colinclark> it\'s not much more than a few regexes on top of calling the Windows tasklist utility: https://github.com/coreybutler/node-windows/blob/master/lib/cmd.js#L58-L82
2016-06-28T16:00:32 <clown> yes, colinclark
2016-06-28T16:01:06 <colinclark> A few other potential, though not necessarily showstopping reasons are that it seems to be in need of a maintainer
2016-06-28T16:01:23 <colinclark> and that it does a lot of things we don\'t maybe need, in addition to the one we do need
2016-06-28T16:02:01 <clown> yes, his plea for help in the readme might mean the whole thing collapses at some time in the future.
2016-06-28T16:02:36 <colinclark> the lack of source for his executables is a bit odd, too
2016-06-28T16:02:48 <danayo> PaliwalSparsh: I\'m in the fluid standup room

2016-06-28T17:25:21 <simonjb> michelled, cindyli, Bosmon: I add some notes to https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-1841 -- please add any additional notes/changes as needed
2016-06-28T17:25:34 <michelled> thx
2016-06-28T17:25:41 * lliskovoi joined the channel
2016-06-28T17:26:28 <simonjb> Does it make sense for me to spend a little time looking at "3. Use PouchDB in the browser-based unit tests" ?
2016-06-28T17:27:42 <michelled> I think so
2016-06-28T17:27:56 <simonjb> cindyli: do you have any pointers of places to start? I think you mentioned that we (Justin?) had some experience with PouchDB in-browser
2016-06-28T17:29:05 <michelled> at least as much as you need to so we can get a feel for the amount of work involved
2016-06-28T17:36:32 * cindyli joined the channel
2016-06-28T17:40:43 <cindyli> simonjb: this is the pouchdb data source that justin wrote for the metadata - https://github.com/fluid-project/metadata/blob/master/src/components/pouchDBDataSource/js/pouchDBDataSource.js
