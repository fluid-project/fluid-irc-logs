2016-06-20T18:35:56 <jhung> gtirloni, simonjb, anyone else\xe2\x80\xa6 I\'m trying to get a Pressbooks dev environment running on my local machine. They have an Ansible playbook to set this up, but I honestly don\'t know much about using Ansible. Their repo is here: https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks-ansible Any advice / tutorials I should look at?
2016-06-20T18:38:00 * sepidehshahi has quit
2016-06-20T18:39:01 <gtirloni> jhung, I never heard of pressbooks. That being said, you can start a CentOS vagrant box and try it there... our CentOS box comes with Ansible
2016-06-20T18:39:14 <gtirloni> mkdir pressbooks; cd pressbooks; vagrant init inclusivedesign/centos7; vagrant up
2016-06-20T18:39:39 * PaliwalSparsh has quit
2016-06-20T18:40:10 <jhung> ok gtirloni I\'ll go from there.
2016-06-20T18:41:07 <avtar> jhung: looks like they just want wordpress set up
2016-06-20T18:41:24 <gtirloni> looks like they included a Vagrantfile too.. so clone that repo, go into the ansible directory and run `vagrant up`
2016-06-20T18:41:42 <jhung> yes avtar it\'s a wordpress plugin project. But it has a particular networks / multisite configuration.
2016-06-20T18:42:48 <avtar> jhung: unfortunately i\'m not sure if their ansible work will be of use to you
2016-06-20T18:43:53 <avtar> it seems to install mariadb, php, and apache but you probably want the unchecked "pressbooks-setup role" listed here:  https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks-ansible/pull/1
2016-06-20T18:45:01 <jhung> ah ok. I\'ll ping them and ask how to best get set up.
2016-06-20T18:45:09 <jhung> thanks avtar and gtirloni.

2016-06-20T20:52:37 <wannabeCitizen> Anyone have opinions on PapaParse as a CSV Parser for JS? http://papaparse.com/
2016-06-20T20:53:06 <wannabeCitizen> I used it awhile back (1.5 yrs) and it worked well. I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking of making it a dependency in the data-dashboard app.
2016-06-20T21:00:59 <wannabeCitizen> On further inspection of chartAuthoring, I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering why d3 isn\xe2\x80\x99t included in the closures where d3 is used. It\xe2\x80\x99s just referenced statically from the JS script tag. Am I wrong to think it should be explicitly injected via a closure? Bosmon cindyli \xe2\x80\x94thoughts?
2016-06-20T21:01:35 <Bosmon> wannabeCitizen - we typically only use the closure pattern where there is a potential versioning issue
2016-06-20T21:01:53 <Bosmon> jQuery for example is a highly widely-deployed library that we\'d like to be insulated from potential others users of
2016-06-20T21:02:06 <wannabeCitizen> oic
2016-06-20T21:02:14 <Bosmon> And "back in the day" we used to have some clients who would deploy multiple version of Infusion concurrently in the same site
2016-06-20T21:02:25 <wannabeCitizen> so infusion-all.js exposes jquery and fluid as global names and you scoop those up explicitly for your closures
2016-06-20T21:02:28 <wannabeCitizen> ?
2016-06-20T21:02:38 <Bosmon> We don\'t have any of these currently, and we haven\'t had an infusion version bump for some years, but the pattern remains, prophylactically
2016-06-20T21:02:56 <Bosmon> I think a d3 versioning issue is possible, but probably fairly unlikely with the usage patterns we have now
2016-06-20T21:03:34 <Bosmon> papaparse looks competent enough
2016-06-20T21:03:47 <wannabeCitizen> Is there any reason _not_ to use the closure to inject d3 for consistency sake?
2016-06-20T21:03:48 <Bosmon> Sensible licence, reasonable community
2016-06-20T21:04:03 <wannabeCitizen> It\xe2\x80\x99s an active community if I remember correctly
2016-06-20T21:04:32 <Bosmon> wannabeCitizen - Sure, you can inject d3
2016-06-20T21:04:44 <Bosmon> There are no particular reasons against it other than the small increase in bureaucracy
2016-06-20T21:05:06 <wannabeCitizen> K - it just seems like a sanity check to keep my components that need d3 easily reconizable right when you see the closure arguments
2016-06-20T21:05:16 <Bosmon> Sure
2016-06-20T21:05:30 <wannabeCitizen> 8)
2016-06-20T21:06:05 <Bosmon> This pattern doesn\'t generalise nicely to node-aware code, but on the other hand we have no good answer to combining global visibility with multiple active versions in that environment yet anyway
2016-06-20T21:06:16 <Bosmon> So it is multiple years before any of this shit hits the fan : P
2016-06-20T21:06:28 <Bosmon> There\'s a new ES6 module spec but it is abominable
2016-06-20T21:06:33 <Bosmon> So I expect this issue to run and run
2016-06-20T21:06:37 <wannabeCitizen> AH yes, well we can refactor once we move this dashboard code into a node deployable version
2016-06-20T21:06:49 <wannabeCitizen> I don\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate that being painstakingly hard once it works as a client app
2016-06-20T21:07:35 <Bosmon> It\'s interesting to follow the wrangles between the node community and the ES6 community as they try to dream up ways of harmonising their conceptions of how modules work
2016-06-20T21:08:06 <Bosmon> Personally I think the node model for modules is sort of adequate, and the ES6 model is pretty inadequate
2016-06-20T21:08:30 <wannabeCitizen> e.g, export modules explicitly and then require them elsewhere?
2016-06-20T21:08:34 <wannabeCitizen> Yeah it seemed to work fine
2016-06-20T21:08:42 <wannabeCitizen> ES6 just wants to get all OO savvy
2016-06-20T21:08:54 <Bosmon> Well, they\'re part of the "protectionist" model of development
2016-06-20T21:09:01 <Bosmon> Where users need to be prevented from doing themselves harm
2016-06-20T21:09:21 <wannabeCitizen> That\xe2\x80\x99s why I always wear soft fluffy gloves
2016-06-20T21:09:24 <Bosmon> As a result, they remove most of the useful language/environment features that make them useful
2016-06-20T21:09:44 <Bosmon> Google and Microsoft tried to do that a few times with JavaScript, with predictable results
2016-06-20T21:10:12 <Bosmon> One of the primary virtues of JavaScript is its dynamism
2016-06-20T21:10:18 <wannabeCitizen> If only we had a time machine to go back to that first weekend when they were hacking together ECMA in the 90\'s
2016-06-20T21:10:23 <wannabeCitizen> We could forewarn
2016-06-20T21:10:34 <Bosmon> Our forewarnings would go unheeded :)
2016-06-20T21:10:48 <Bosmon> I\'m quite sure there was a substantial number of people already there to forewarn them : P
2016-06-20T21:11:04 <wannabeCitizen> *looks upward* \xe2\x80\x9cyou hear that future time travelers, get your warnings in order and hurry up\xe2\x80\x9d
2016-06-20T21:11:13 <wannabeCitizen> LOL

2016-06-20T13:16:13 <gtirloni> it\'s not required. as far as we know (or that\'s been reported to us), there aren\'t any bugs we\'re facing that will be fixed by that version
