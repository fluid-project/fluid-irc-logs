2016-10-20T16:32:52 <cindyli> gtirloni_: this issue seems kettle specific. I tried "npm install" on gpii-pouchdb: https://github.com/the-t-in-rtf/gpii-pouchdb/tree/GPII-1897, the build works fine
2016-10-20T16:33:06 <cindyli> gpii-pouchdb uses pouchdb, which uses leveldown
2016-10-20T16:33:14 <gtirloni_> cindyli: yeah, i was going to suggest you tried to install leveldown alone, but that takes care of it
2016-10-20T16:35:12 * clown joined the channel
2016-10-20T16:44:16 <gtirloni_> cindyli: i removed the gpii-pouchdb dependency in kettle\'s package.json and added pouchdb 6.0.7 instead... it installed fine
2016-10-20T16:44:44 <cindyli> ah ha. nice try

2016-10-20T17:52:43 <alanharnum> i\'ll have another PR shortly for running the node packaging tests as part of the testem command
2016-10-20T17:53:11 <Justin_o> alanharnum: cool thanks
2016-10-20T17:53:23 <alanharnum> i found a basic approach that incorporates the result as part of a test report
2016-10-20T17:54:08 <Justin_o> alanharnum: that\'s great, seems you\'ve managed to figure that out pretty quickly too
2016-10-20T17:57:42 <alanharnum> it\'s not perfect because it treats the whole node-basic-tests.js as a single test and doesn\'t report the actual number of pass / fails; we can decide whether or not that\'s good enough for now, or defer it until later
2016-10-20T17:58:22 <alanharnum> it would be a chunk more work to get node-basic-tests.js reporting in the format testem likes; not sure how much without further experimentation
2016-10-20T17:59:30 * clown has quit
2016-10-20T17:59:42 <Justin_o> alanharnum: i think it\'s still a jqUnit based test, so hopefully you could use a similar reporting mechanics that the the other tests use
2016-10-20T18:00:32 <alanharnum> Justin_o: yeah, that\'s one stream of thought - ATM the solution is to run the tests as a custom process launcher as described here: https://github.com/testem/testem#running-tests-in-node-and-custom-process-launchers
2016-10-20T18:00:57 <alanharnum> it looks like getting that to report back to testem requires TAP-compliant output
2016-10-20T18:01:03 <alanharnum> but i haven\'t dug too deeply
2016-10-20T18:16:06 <cindyli> Bosmon: seems kasparnet has some questions for you on his infusion doc pull request for the model transformation - https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/pull/86#issuecomment-231045345

2016-10-20T14:29:03 <cindyli1> gtirloni_: I\'m hitting an error running "yarn" with my GPII-1274 branch: http://pastebin.com/Vb8gsH3X. it fails at installing "leveldown" package, which looks familiar. as i rmb, we hit the same error after you increased the stack size in VM attempting to work around the npm stack size exceeded issue
2016-10-20T14:29:19 <cindyli1> i know you tried yarn with universal master
2016-10-20T14:29:37 <cindyli1> did you try with my branch that hits the stack size issue?
2016-10-20T14:30:15 * cindyli1 is now known as cindyli
2016-10-20T14:30:29 <gtirloni_> cindyli1: i think i tried master. are you running this on OSX or inside the VM?
2016-10-20T14:31:49 <cindyli> gtirloni_: no, just with my local mac terminal
2016-10-20T14:31:57 <cindyli> not with VM
2016-10-20T14:32:20 <cindyli> OSX 10.11.6
2016-10-20T14:34:15 <gtirloni_> the errors with level were happening because of the shared folder, if i remember correctly. when we implemented the split node_modules, then it went away. but it would be different in this case... i\'ll try to understand this better here
2016-10-20T14:34:24 <cindyli> hitting the same error with running yarn on kettle
2016-10-20T14:35:45 <cindyli> gtirloni_: ya, that\'s how we work around the issue since at then the error occurs in VM not on local run of "npm install". seems yarn promotes that error to the local ;)
2016-10-20T14:42:21 <cindyli> actually, just noticed running kettle with "npm install" using npm3 also throws an error at building leveldown
