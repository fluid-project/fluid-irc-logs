2016-03-09T17:44:17 <the-t-in-rtf> Not sure if this is a C4A deliverable any more.
2016-03-09T17:44:36 <danayo> I think the short answer, the-t-in-rtf, is no :)
2016-03-09T17:44:41 <danayo> I have not seen it
2016-03-09T17:44:49 <danayo> can I see it?
2016-03-09T17:45:03 <the-t-in-rtf> Unfortunately I only saw a screen share.
2016-03-09T17:45:34 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, I will ask about it in the next meeting where it came up, to make sure they close the loop.
2016-03-09T17:45:45 <danayo> great, thanks the-t-in-rtf

2016-03-09T23:09:30 <akshay> Hi @justin_o and @danayo
2016-03-09T23:10:25 <akshay> as I conveyed earlier I was working on the UI mockups and gameplay and spending a bit more time on understanding the project better by going through the various links
2016-03-09T23:10:34 <akshay> pointed out by you people.
2016-03-09T23:11:00 <danayo> hello akshay, that's great
2016-03-09T23:11:47 <akshay> It took me a little more time with my UI mockups because of the exams and viral fever I'm having. I should have done it a bit earlier.
2016-03-09T23:12:15 <akshay> I would want you to go through this link : https://github.com/AkshayAgarwal007/First-Discovery-of-Preferences/blob/master/README.md
2016-03-09T23:12:41 <akshay> and give me inputs and feedback on what you want more and what you want to be changed.
2016-03-09T23:13:23 <akshay> And if there's anything I misunderstood or you would not want it to be implemented in the actual project and things that I need to add to this.
2016-03-09T23:25:52 * kasparne_ has quit
2016-03-09T23:30:07 <akshay> I don't have the JavaScript games that I have previously made available online still to showcase an app that I have previously developed and good numbers
2016-03-09T23:30:24 <akshay> of users are using this : https://github.com/AkshayAgarwal007/Moodly
2016-03-09T23:31:17 <akshay> Though this has nothing to do with JavaScript, I just wanted to showcase something that I have developed which is hosted online.
2016-03-09T23:31:48 <akshay> Waiting for the inputs.

2016-03-09T13:26:12 <jhung> Awesome_A: There are two ways to assign. There is the Assign button along the toolbar just below the site header. There\'s also an "Assign to me" link along the right.
2016-03-09T13:26:18 <jhung> Do any of those work?
2016-03-09T13:28:19 <jhung> PaliwalSparsh: Give a moment to take a look.

2016-03-09T13:36:30 * PaliwalSparsh has quit
2016-03-09T13:38:37 <PaliwalSparsh1> @jhung I have sent a PR for that about 6 days ago but Justin_o asked me to make changed in the src/component/pager/Pager.css and not in the demos pager.css, I haveb been trying since but changes in Pager.css in src are not picked up by the demo what I realised eventually was that it was because of the .fl-pager-ui class in there I removed it and it worked.
2016-03-09T13:38:55 <PaliwalSparsh1> **changes
2016-03-09T13:40:36 <PaliwalSparsh1> I guess inface none of the selectors that are having .fl-pager-ui in them are not being picked by the demo.
2016-03-09T13:41:40 <PaliwalSparsh1> This is the very reason demo has current-page properties specified in it that are already specified in the Pager.css in src.
2016-03-09T13:41:59 <jhung> PaliwalSparsh1: ah. It sounds like an issue with "specificity" in CSS.
2016-03-09T13:43:07 <jhung> In our CSS we scope everything to a named class, which should make customization and integration into 3rd parties easier and with less conflicts.
2016-03-09T13:44:55 <Justin_o> Awesome_A: you probably don\'t have permission in JIRA to assign a ticket to yourself. For now, just leave a comment that you are working on it
2016-03-09T13:44:59 <PaliwalSparsh1> And I guess here we have one selector fl-pager-ui which is messing with the scope.
2016-03-09T13:46:25 <jhung> PaliwalSparsh1: yes very likely. The trick is finding the right set of selectors that will accomplish what you want, but not so specific that the selector line becomes huge and hard to maintain. :)
2016-03-09T13:46:57 <Awesome_A> jhung: ok
2016-03-09T13:47:37 <PaliwalSparsh1> ok, I guess other problem could also be that we have not used the class fl-pager-ui in the demo and it is making the selectors useless.
2016-03-09T13:48:31 <PaliwalSparsh1> I will try some more then thanks jhung :-)
2016-03-09T13:50:25 <jhung> PaliwalSparsh1: great! Feel free to ping me any time.
2016-03-09T14:02:00 * PaliwalSparsh4 has quit
2016-03-09T14:04:14 <PaliwalSparsh1> @Justin_o In the PR I sent for FLUID-3921 you asked me to update Pager.css in src so that changes come to demo automatically but it won\'t be possible and we have to define the changes both in demo and src would that be ok.
2016-03-09T14:04:38 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh1: why isn\'t it possible?
2016-03-09T14:06:15 <PaliwalSparsh1> @Justin_o When I made changes in the Pager.css in .fl-pager .fl-pager-ui .fl-pager-disabled{ //style } , those changes were not reflected in demo, on investigating i found that it was because fl-pager-ui is class is not present in demo
2016-03-09T14:06:58 <PaliwalSparsh1> when I added this class fl-pager-ui to demo the changes were appearing.
2016-03-09T14:07:50 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh1: okay... so the question you are asking is can you make the changes to the css in Pager.css and add fl-pager-ui to the demo markup?
2016-03-09T14:08:37 * alanharnum joined the channel
2016-03-09T14:08:39 <PaliwalSparsh1> Also we can see in the demo properties for .demo-pager-links .fl-pager-currentPage are specified but they are not supposed to be as they are meant to be picked from src/ Pager.css. Yes Justin I guess we should add that class so all the changes in main Pager.css will be reflected in the demo
2016-03-09T14:09:50 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh1: i think that\'s better... reduce the duplication of the CSS across the component and demo css files, and add the missing classes to the demo markup.
2016-03-09T14:10:43 <PaliwalSparsh1> thanks justin. I will sumbit FLUID-3921 with these changes.
