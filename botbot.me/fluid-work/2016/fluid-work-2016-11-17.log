2016-11-17T16:32:01 <stegru> ok, thanks!
2016-11-17T16:32:11 <colinclark> Justin_o: Did you see the pull requests submitted to Infusion yesterday related to the ARIA application role?

2016-11-17T16:49:54 <Justin_o> colinclark:  yep, mentioned it in the channel earlier today. What are your thoughts on that?
2016-11-17T16:50:04 <colinclark> oh let me catch up on the logs
2016-11-17T16:50:09 <colinclark> I was curious about your opinion
2016-11-17T16:50:30 <Justin_o> colinclark: i just mentioned it to michelle, that\'s about it
2016-11-17T16:50:35 <Justin_o> colinclark: and at standup just now as well
2016-11-17T16:51:02 <Justin_o> colinclark: it\'s unfortunately late in the game, in terms of the 2.0 release, but i don\'t think it would require much retesting either
2016-11-17T16:51:15 <colinclark> do you think it\'s a correct fix?
2016-11-17T16:51:29 <Justin_o> colinclark: so we could potentially get it in, also regarding uploader i think we\'ll probably still need the application role, but maybe we can scope it more directly.
2016-11-17T16:51:33 <colinclark> My impression was that it wasn\'t a particularly descriptive JIRA, in that it didn\'t address specific issues encountered
2016-11-17T16:51:41 <colinclark> what\'s the scoping issue?
2016-11-17T16:52:06 <michelled> oh, sorry, I hadn\'t seen the mention
2016-11-17T16:52:15 <Justin_o> colinclark: we move it lower, it\'s probably only needed for the file queue rows
2016-11-17T16:52:29 <colinclark> ah, yes
2016-11-17T16:52:41 * the-t-in-rtf joined the channel
2016-11-17T16:52:55 <colinclark> directly on the element that uses "app-style" keyboard navigation?
2016-11-17T16:53:09 <Justin_o> colinclark:  and regarding pager, i can\'t think of why it\'s needed at all.
2016-11-17T16:53:10 <Justin_o> colinclark: yes
2016-11-17T16:53:34 <Justin_o> so perhaps we could scope the application role to the tbody for the uploader
2016-11-17T16:56:54 <Justin_o> colinclark: how does that sound?
2016-11-17T16:59:20 <colinclark> I think it makes sense to me
2016-11-17T16:59:37 <colinclark> and if it is superfluous in the Pager, seems like it might be worth tossing it
2016-11-17T16:59:50 <colinclark> My impression is that we should always take accessibility bugs very, very seriously
2016-11-17T17:00:02 <colinclark> I don\'t really want to intervene in the decision on whether to include it for 2.0 or not
2016-11-17T17:00:06 <colinclark> especially since we\'re SO CLOSE
2016-11-17T17:00:14 <colinclark> but if you thought it was practical, I\'d support it
2016-11-17T17:02:23 <Justin_o> colinclark: my first thought is that we should just do it now, maybe take over the PRs and make the changes we want.
2016-11-17T17:02:34 <colinclark> seems reasonable
2016-11-17T17:03:57 <Justin_o> colinclark: cool, thanks for the chat
2016-11-17T17:04:11 <colinclark> thanks for thinking about it, I appreciate it

2016-11-17T19:02:47 <Justin_o> do we need to get a CLA signed for that. The person seems to work for UNICON, not sure if we have a CCLA signed with them, and i think the changes are all removals.

2016-11-17T20:13:48 <Justin_o> Chris123: also a heads up, because we are pushing on a 2.0 release, i\'m going to take over your PR to master to fix up somethings. Then could you use that as a reference for making similar changes to your PR for the 1.4.x line.
2016-11-17T20:16:00 <Chris123> Always glad to be of assistance
2016-11-17T20:16:38 <Chris123> Sounds good, sorry for making changes so close to a release

2016-11-17T13:56:10 <Justin_o> etc.
2016-11-17T13:56:39 <gtirloni> thanks, it\'s certainly relevant

2016-11-17T13:58:56 <gtirloni> i\'ll review this, thanks for the pointer. right now nothing comes to my mind but i\'m sure there\'s a lot we can improve

2016-11-17T14:19:42 <michelled> no, cindyli - do you remember?
2016-11-17T14:19:51 <michelled> it was linking to the gpii wiki instead of the infusion docs
2016-11-17T14:20:09 <cindyli> i should be able to find out
2016-11-17T14:23:02 <cindyli> Justin_o: if u search thru infusion-docs repo with this link: https://wiki.gpii.net/w/Architecture_-_Available_transformation_functions, there are a few pages having links pointing to it. those links should be repointed to http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/ModelTransformationAPI.html

2016-11-17T15:06:04 <colinclark> Bosmon: The recurring security conversation
2016-11-17T15:06:08 <colinclark> michelled beat me to it
2016-11-17T15:06:09 <Bosmon> ok
2016-11-17T15:06:19 <Bosmon> Very lucky that I happen to be here : P
2016-11-17T15:06:22 <Bosmon> I may have to peel off a bit early
2016-11-17T15:06:32 <colinclark> ok
2016-11-17T15:06:35 <Bosmon> Since I need to drive down to London before the Windows meeting
2016-11-17T15:06:39 <colinclark> peel it

2016-11-17T16:20:57 <colinclark> simonjb: Last night, I made this: https://github.com/colinbdclark/flocking-midi-router
2016-11-17T16:21:33 <colinclark> both the-t-in-rtf and I have this issue of wanting to be able to route a USB-only MIDI device to another without an intervening "computer"
2016-11-17T16:21:58 <colinclark> where a Pi or CHIP in a box hides away the fact that there still is a computer
2016-11-17T16:22:15 <colinclark> anyway, the point is that it immediately occurred to me how important the Nexus will be to these kinds of things
2016-11-17T16:22:49 <colinclark> because of course you have the problem of actually forming the relay\xe2\x80\x94here done in a very rudimentary way with command line flags
2016-11-17T16:22:59 <colinclark> but then dealing with connections being plugged in, unplugged etc.
2016-11-17T16:23:47 <colinclark> I really can imagine quite a nice world where you have a Nexus box and then you just plug your "endpoints" into either it directly or to some Nexus connector boxes
2016-11-17T16:23:57 <colinclark> perhaps pop on to a website to confirm the connection between devices
2016-11-17T16:23:57 <gtirloni> cindyli: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chrome-remote-desktop/gbchcmhmhahfdphkhkmpfmihenigjmpp?utm_source=chrome-app-launcher-info-dialog
2016-11-17T16:23:59 <colinclark> and then off you go
2016-11-17T16:26:20 <simonjb> colinclark: very cool
2016-11-17T16:28:44 <stegru> in a sentence, or link, what is "the nexus"?
