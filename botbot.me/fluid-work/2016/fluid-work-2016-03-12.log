2016-03-12T15:03:42 <PaliwalSparsh> @colinclark@danayo I was making the decision of how to implement the game of preference discovery. This is very rough mockup just to show what I mean.
2016-03-12T15:03:47 <PaliwalSparsh> https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3GzDUy0ulh-TDlFZlJUWWZKRjg/view?usp=sharing
2016-03-12T15:03:54 <PaliwalSparsh> the only way that I was able to come up with was to make a preference editor that includes all the required  preferences, as the person plays through the game preferences are set accordingly and the preferences can also be set using the preference bar on the same page that is made with preference framwork directly, injecting the components made by preference framework into the game would not be possible as all html game engine work over
2016-03-12T15:03:54 <PaliwalSparsh> canvas, and canvas wont render HTML. This seems to be the most viable way, We would make enactors so as whenever we make changes in preference bar changes are reflected in the game. And when preferences are set in game we would make them also set in preference bar.

2016-03-12T15:33:16 <amanvar> I have done some issues on "good First Bugs". Now I want to do some work on main project "Game for First Discovery of Preferences". Can anyone give me direction.

2016-03-12T20:34:03 <akshay> @danayo, I would want you to have a look at this: http://akshayagarwal007.github.io/First-Discovery-of-Preferences/
2016-03-12T20:35:26 <akshay> This is a workable UI mockup, I have modified the various game arts as the original ones were not fitting it properly, I have added a few sounds as well.
2016-03-12T20:36:42 <akshay> For text to speech I\'ve used ResponsiveVoice.js just fot demonstration purpose, in the original project it would be achieved via infusion text to speech.
2016-03-12T20:39:14 <akshay> You have to wait 2-3 seconds for the various images and sound files to load , I haven\'t set a preloader state yet.
2016-03-12T20:43:25 <akshay> I\'ve already set the environment up for infusion and after this I would start to work on interfacing infusion preference framework and phaser.
2016-03-12T20:50:39 <akshay> danayo: I need your inputs on this.
