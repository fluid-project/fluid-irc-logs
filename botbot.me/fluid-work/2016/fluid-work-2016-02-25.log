b'2016-02-25T17:20:33 <colinclark> but if you squint at it, you can see the point
2016-02-25T17:20:42 <colinclark> Level 0 is "nothing personal"
2016-02-25T17:20:58 <colinclark> Level 1 will include minimal personal information, perhaps just enough to create a GPII account and so on
2016-02-25T17:21:09 <cindyli> this is very helpful, colinclark
2016-02-25T17:21:38 <cindyli> thanks. now i have a better understanding of this item
2016-02-25T17:22:25 <cindyli> colinclark: other items says "work with simon and I", is that the IBM developer you mentioned yesterday will be working with us?
2016-02-25T17:23:15 <colinclark> There will be two people from IBM working on this project
2016-02-25T17:23:30 <colinclark> One is a security/privacy consultant
2016-02-25T17:23:48 <colinclark> not a programmer, but someone who is an expert in the various policies and compliance standards
2016-02-25T17:23:53 <cindyli> cool
2016-02-25T17:24:01 <colinclark> another who will be a developer, and we\'ve clearly asked for somone with modern security expertise
2016-02-25T17:24:05 <simonjb> sorry cindyli, was out grabbing lunch, back
2016-02-25T17:24:12 <colinclark> and skills building apps in the GPII-related technologies
2016-02-25T17:24:16 <cindyli> np, simonjb
2016-02-25T17:24:17 <colinclark> What\'d you get, simonjb?
2016-02-25T17:24:43 <simonjb> sandwich and soup from a sandwich place on queen

2016-02-25T17:26:04 <cindyli> haha, sounds fun
2016-02-25T17:26:58 <cindyli> that\'s all my questions, colinclark, simonjb. if there\'s anything you think I should know before the kick off meeting, ping me pls
2016-02-25T17:27:31 <cindyli> thanks, guys
2016-02-25T17:28:05 <colinclark> cindyli: Cool, that was easy :)
2016-02-25T17:28:19 <cindyli> easy but helpful :)
2016-02-25T17:28:55 <colinclark> I do love a good sarnie, simonjb
2016-02-25T17:29:14 <colinclark> And sometimes Bosmon seems to quote from some show that might have been called "Colin\'s Sandwich?"
2016-02-25T17:29:31 <simonjb> ha, I don\'t know that one
2016-02-25T17:29:49 <colinclark> here it is: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin\'s_Sandwich
2016-02-25T17:30:03 <colinclark> I wonder if there was a follow up series
2016-02-25T17:30:08 <colinclark> called Simon\'s Sandwich
2016-02-25T17:31:02 <simonjb> it\'s entirely likely, yes

2016-02-25T17:47:41 <bens01> Justin_o, correct
2016-02-25T17:47:52 <Justin_o> bens01: thanks, i\'ll update the test plan
2016-02-25T17:49:25 <bens01> Justin_o, thats from the usability dry run feedback. the onscreen keyboard also moved to be grouped with sticky keys
2016-02-25T17:51:20 <Justin_o> bens01: okay, thanks... i\'ll update the order in the test plan too.. where there any other things that should be updated in the test plans?
2016-02-25T17:52:30 * yzen joined the channel
2016-02-25T17:52:44 <bens01> Justin_o, i don\'t *think* so. the other changes were to text. And on the electron preview some header items were removed to put content higher up on the screen
2016-02-25T17:53:24 <bens01> i don\'t think the test plans today are explicitly calling out the other changes like they are for the onscreen keyboard
2016-02-25T17:54:01 <Justin_o> bens01: no the test plans were fairly general about exact instruction text and content of the preview other than things that are related to preference changes
2016-02-25T17:54:04 <Justin_o> bens01: thanks for the update

2016-02-25T18:37:32 <simonjb> hey jhernandez, looking at your diagrams -- what format are they in?
2016-02-25T18:47:14 <simonjb> jhernandez: looks like a container XML with some compressed data
2016-02-25T18:47:36 <simonjb> the compressed data expands to an mxGraphModel XML doc
2016-02-25T18:47:47 <simonjb> what\'s a good way of viewing this?
2016-02-25T18:48:01 <simonjb> alternatively, could you convert to PDF or other format?

2016-02-25T20:50:00 <Bosmon> Hi there Justin_o - I don\'t know how you and bens01 were getting on with your model relay explosion but I have written it up at https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5869 and it looks like a framework fix will be quite easy
2016-02-25T20:50:13 <Bosmon> In the meantime, I think the workaround I suggested yesterday should work fine in the user code
2016-02-25T20:50:27 <Bosmon> I\'m just working on building an isolated test case now...
2016-02-25T20:51:04 <bens01> Bosmon, i\'ve reworked the confirmation panel and wrapped the relayEvents in fluid.invokeLater() and that has indeed worked
2016-02-25T20:51:14 <Bosmon> bens01 - awesome
2016-02-25T20:54:33 <bens01> Bosmon, was looking at the gpii-binder as well but pulled it out to work some other issues on that panel
2016-02-25T20:54:50 <Bosmon> bens - "pulled it out"?
2016-02-25T20:55:16 <bens01> I mean abandoned using it in first discovery tool (for now)
2016-02-25T20:55:21 <Bosmon> ah ok
2016-02-25T20:55:45 <bens01> Bosmon, one possible extension could be to allow one way data binding from model -> page only. In our case, we\'re not using dom elements that you can set with fluid.value
2016-02-25T20:57:03 <Bosmon> bens01 - I assume they would repond to $.text() though
2016-02-25T20:57:22 <bens01> Bosmon, I tried extending the long form options to include a unidirectional option and providing your own "elementAccessFunction" such as fluid.value, fluid.text, fluid.html
2016-02-25T20:57:50 <bens01> that worked well for our case to set $.text(), exactly
2016-02-25T20:57:57 <Bosmon> bens01 - sounds good
2016-02-25T20:58:22 <Bosmon> $.text() would naturally be a unidirectional linkage
2016-02-25T20:58:51 <Bosmon> The "old renderer" was good enough to handle these cases, but not all of its capabilities had been broken out into gpii-binder yet
2016-02-25T20:58:53 <bens01> Bosmon, yes i was thinking that.. perhaps unidirectional = true implies text
2016-02-25T20:58:58 <Bosmon> Any contributions and suggestions you have would be very welcome
2016-02-25T20:59:07 <Bosmon> Especially your sketch implementation
2016-02-25T21:00:26 <Bosmon> I was thinking you were using "pulled it out" in this sense :) http://grammar-monster.com/sayings_proverbs/pull_your_finger_out.htm
2016-02-25T21:02:04 <Bosmon> It seems that the phrase has been in use since about 1875 which rules out this explanation as a possibility though : P

2016-02-25T21:51:16 <bens01> Bosmon, thank you.
2016-02-25T21:51:45 <bens01> Bosmon, sketch of one way binding here: https://github.com/benjaminstokes/gpii-binder/blob/pga/README.md#additional-long-notation-options and here https://github.com/benjaminstokes/gpii-binder/commit/008e56c8d6e06fe8fe8cabd300a087ea5d9dd296
2016-02-25T21:55:54 <Bosmon> bens01 - looks good
2016-02-25T21:56:18 <Bosmon> As a suggestion, you should accept string encodings of "method" as global values, so that the component\'s options can still be encoded as JSON
2016-02-25T21:56:41 <Bosmon> You can use the framework utility fluid.getGlobalValue to fetch the referenced function: http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/CoreAPI.html#fluid-getglobalvalue-path-
2016-02-25T21:57:44 <bens01> ah, good point
2016-02-25T22:03:35 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I wanted to refer you to this discussion on the gpii-binder in fact
2016-02-25T22:03:36 <Bosmon> https://github.com/GPII/gpii-binder/pull/1#discussion_r54069007
2016-02-25T22:03:45 <Bosmon> Since we are currently discussing how the test cases for it should best be expressed
2016-02-25T22:03:55 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf has made the point that jquery.simulate has been unmaintained for a while
2016-02-25T22:04:12 <Bosmon> But on the other hand, we probably have thousands of lines of test cases expressed using it, and they seem to be working well enough for us

2016-02-25T16:59:43 <colinclark> sorry I wasn\'t here earlier--I just totally forgot to open my IRC client this morning
2016-02-25T17:00:07 <cindyli> hi colinclark, great to see you hopped on
2016-02-25T17:00:32 <cindyli> thanks for offering a chat for my APCP questions. also thought might be more efficient to talk than to type
2016-02-25T17:01:09 <colinclark> I\'m into either
2016-02-25T17:01:17 <cindyli> colinclark, simonjb, would u have some time today to chat about APCP security priority list?
2016-02-25T17:01:25 <cindyli> should be fairly quick
2016-02-25T17:01:31 <colinclark> Sooner is better for me
2016-02-25T17:01:33 <cindyli> 10 mins probably, hopefully
2016-02-25T17:01:37 <colinclark> so I can write this afternoon
2016-02-25T17:01:55 <cindyli> shall we do it now? simonjb?

2016-02-25T17:14:03 <cindyli> colinclark: seems we cannot corner simonjb at the moment. I just post my question here and ur guys can answer when having some time
2016-02-25T17:14:08 <colinclark> ok
2016-02-25T17:14:13 <cindyli> regarding the security priority list - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QkX3TCrNYotChicTbr8lRI4A7IyatBF6MNt-Wg-YLwM/edit
2016-02-25T17:14:23 <cindyli> item 1 says: Create the model for level 0 and level 1
2016-02-25T17:14:28 <cindyli> what are level 0 and 1?
2016-02-25T17:14:47 <colinclark> Those are documented somewhere, but probably only in the task order
2016-02-25T17:14:49 <colinclark> let me dig them up
2016-02-25T17:15:04 <cindyli> thanks
2016-02-25T17:15:20 <colinclark> but the point of these different levels is to try to encourage IBM to not drive towards the most complex security and privacy situations first
2016-02-25T17:15:36 <colinclark> but rather to come up with some scenarios in which we actively choose not to store certain kinds of data
2016-02-25T17:15:54 <colinclark> so that we can evolve our security and privacy system
2016-02-25T17:16:05 <colinclark> There are times when Gregg likes to say that "GPII can store anything!"
2016-02-25T17:16:13 <colinclark> and often uses the example of word completion dictionaries
2016-02-25T17:16:24 <colinclark> which you\'ve probably seen in ATs that help a user type or write
2016-02-25T17:16:24 <cindyli> does the higher level means more complex security situation?
2016-02-25T17:16:30 <colinclark> yes, exactly
2016-02-25T17:16:44 <cindyli> i would love to see those defined levels
2016-02-25T17:16:45 <colinclark> the higher the level number, the more potential for storing so-called "PII"
2016-02-25T17:16:47 <colinclark> personally identifying information
2016-02-25T17:17:06 <colinclark> You can imagine in theory that someone\'s word completion dictionary would be very important to them
2016-02-25T17:17:14 <colinclark> if they have difficulty typing
2016-02-25T17:17:22 <colinclark> but also that it could contain things that were quite sensitive
2016-02-25T17:17:29 <colinclark> credit cards or passwords or whatever
2016-02-25T17:17:44 <cindyli> ok
2016-02-25T17:17:53 * alanharnum joined the channel
2016-02-25T17:18:02 <colinclark> but when we get into the scenario of "GPII can store anything!" we suddenly face, in the context of the U.S. Federal Government, some very huge privacy requirements
2016-02-25T17:18:13 <colinclark> many of which will be very, very, very costly to implement
2016-02-25T17:18:26 <colinclark> let\'s see if I can find the definitions of those levels
2016-02-25T17:18:30 <colinclark> they were only really sketched out
2016-02-25T17:18:40 <colinclark> since the point of the first round of work is to determine them
2016-02-25T17:19:22 <cindyli> i see
2016-02-25T17:20:02 <colinclark> "Level 0 -  no personal information of any kind.   For example, use of non-editable shared-public-generic preference sets. "
2016-02-25T17:20:10 <colinclark> "Level 1  - for data that has no identifying information and no personal information other than personal preferences for settings.  No text or string data of any kind that is not in the Preference Term Dictionary.
2016-02-25T17:20:15 <colinclark> You can see that these are a bit strange
2016-02-25T17:20:28 <colinclark> I\'m not sure that there\'s any meaning to the expression "not text that is not in the preference term dictionary"
'
