2016-09-26T13:32:54 <alanharnum> thanks cindyli

2016-09-26T13:36:31 <cindyli> Bosmon2: can you have a look on this kettle pull request - https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/pull/26
2016-09-26T13:38:28 <avtar> hey cindyli
2016-09-26T13:40:59 <cindyli> avtar: i wanna to revise this documentation https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/GPII-1821/documentation/ProductionSetupInstructions.md to include the new vm for running GPII in production mode: https://github.com/cindyli/universal/tree/GPII-1821/examples/production-components-vm. thinking you are probably the best person to do this update :)
2016-09-26T13:43:22 <avtar> cindyli: sounds good
2016-09-26T13:44:08 <avtar> although that document sounds like it\'s describing a development environment and not really a production setup
2016-09-26T13:45:02 <cindyli> avtar: good to know. can you base off my GPII-1821 branch https://github.com/cindyli/universal/tree/GPII-1821 and send a pull request agaist my GPII-1821 branch when it\'s done?
2016-09-26T13:45:08 <Bosmon2> Thanks so much for the Kettle pull, cindyli
2016-09-26T13:45:26 <Bosmon2> Did I miss another *ouchdb meeting?
2016-09-26T13:45:31 <Bosmon2> I didn\'t see one in my calendar
2016-09-26T13:45:33 <cindyli> my pleasure, Bosmon2.
2016-09-26T13:45:35 <cindyli> yes, u did
2016-09-26T13:45:47 <cindyli> we just finished the meeting, Bosmon2
2016-09-26T13:45:49 <Bosmon2> Did anything interesting come up?
2016-09-26T13:45:52 <Bosmon2> Any notes?
2016-09-26T13:46:08 <cindyli> notes - https://pad.gpii.net/p/pouchdb-talk-sep-26-2016-2i84n79
2016-09-26T13:46:11 <avtar> cindyli: yup. what\'s the timeline for this work?
2016-09-26T13:46:21 <cindyli> as soon as possible, avtar
2016-09-26T13:46:28 <Bosmon2> Thanks, cindyli
2016-09-26T13:46:42 <cindyli> anytime
2016-09-26T13:47:10 <Bosmon2> the-t-in-rtf - could you unpack the comment " Full text searching just another variant on what we already have, but without the option to test it." ?
2016-09-26T13:47:14 <Bosmon2> What is it that we already have?
2016-09-26T13:48:00 <the-t-in-rtf> couchdb-lucene
2016-09-26T13:48:33 <the-t-in-rtf> this is a similar approach, but uses Clouseau and Dreyfus instead of couchdb-lucene
2016-09-26T13:48:44 <the-t-in-rtf> it\'s still a view that controls the lucene indexing.
2016-09-26T13:48:47 <the-t-in-rtf> and the syntax is very similar
2016-09-26T13:48:51 <the-t-in-rtf> which analyzers to use
2016-09-26T13:49:01 <the-t-in-rtf> which fields to index vs. return in results.
2016-09-26T13:49:24 * kavya joined the channel
2016-09-26T13:50:10 <the-t-in-rtf> my point about testing is that we can only test it with CouchDB 2.0 itself for now.
2016-09-26T13:51:36 <Justin_o> simonjb, the-t-in-rtf: if i\'m reading this right, it looks like Firefox will get support for the date input in FF 50 https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=825294
2016-09-26T13:52:10 <the-t-in-rtf> when will Safari get it?
2016-09-26T13:52:31 <simonjb> interesting, thanks Justin_o -- reported 2012-12-28
2016-09-26T13:52:44 <the-t-in-rtf> Also, yes, thanks.
2016-09-26T13:52:49 <the-t-in-rtf> I will definitely watch that.
2016-09-26T13:55:43 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: regarding safari, no idea.. strange that they don\'t support it yet... I upgraded to the safari 10 last week, which doesn\'t seem to include it either, so I have not expectation for getting it any time soon, but with Apple you just never know.
2016-09-26T13:55:54 * Yan_Hu joined the channel
2016-09-26T13:56:44 <the-t-in-rtf> What\'s odd is that Safari for iOS already supports it at least partially (no max, min, step)
2016-09-26T13:57:34 <simonjb> the firefox bug is pretty interesting reading -- to see the discussions a feature like this goes through to get into Firefox and the cross-platform challenges
2016-09-26T14:02:53 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf, simonjb: hunted around WebKit\'s Bugzilla instance for a bit. I didn\'t find too much, and what was there didn\'t seem to have been touched since 2012

2016-09-26T14:05:35 * danayo joined the channel
2016-09-26T14:06:32 <the-t-in-rtf> yes, "html5 and date" returns absolutely rubbish.
2016-09-26T14:06:34 <the-t-in-rtf> terrible search.
2016-09-26T14:06:36 <the-t-in-rtf> terrible.
2016-09-26T14:06:57 <Justin_o> i searched for "date input" and then did a browser search for the word date
2016-09-26T14:07:06 <Justin_o> there were several issues opened about it.
2016-09-26T14:07:18 <Justin_o> but yes, the search is pretty terrible
