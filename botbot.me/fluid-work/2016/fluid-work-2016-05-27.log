b'2016-05-27T20:18:29 <colinclark_> summarizing the big branch merges and the fact that, for two out of three repos, we now have 100% solid CI
2016-05-27T20:18:44 <colinclark_> and I\'ll summarize the work you\'re doing to get Windows 10 back up and running
2016-05-27T20:18:50 <colinclark_> the heroic effort on your part

2016-05-27T20:25:36 <colinclark_> ok cool
2016-05-27T20:25:38 <alanharnum> avtar: sixteen minutes remaining on the download

2016-05-27T20:25:42 <colinclark_> hahaha
2016-05-27T20:25:53 <alanharnum> bring at least an 8gigabyte USB!
2016-05-27T20:26:09 <avtar> i have a 64 gig one, bruh :)

b'2016-05-27T17:16:41 <colinclark> gtirloni: exactly
2016-05-27T17:16:46 <colinclark> which doesn\'t solve the problem :)
2016-05-27T17:16:59 <colinclark> give us one stable, robust, maintained, and used package manager
2016-05-27T17:17:04 <colinclark> or two is fine
2016-05-27T17:17:05 <colinclark> whatever :)
2016-05-27T17:17:13 <gloob> I told about the "Install AT on Demand"?
2016-05-27T17:17:16 <gloob> xD
2016-05-27T17:17:21 <colinclark> see
2016-05-27T17:17:26 <gloob> that is going to be a pita
2016-05-27T17:17:26 <colinclark> that\'s exactly why you need a package manager :)
2016-05-27T17:17:29 <colinclark> yeah
2016-05-27T17:17:41 <colinclark> and I\'m not convinced that stuff like Maas360 actually does what we want
2016-05-27T17:17:47 <gtirloni> i _think_ this is what they have in mind https://github.com/OneGet/oneget
2016-05-27T17:18:11 <gloob> all the enterprise solutions I found are expensive and I think they don\'t do what we need
2016-05-27T17:18:30 <gloob> there\'s many buzz with that concept
2016-05-27T17:18:39 <colinclark> yes, it\'s a funny thing
2016-05-27T17:18:47 <gloob> gtirloni: who are they?
2016-05-27T17:18:51 <colinclark> most involve centralized IT on decentralized devices
2016-05-27T17:18:57 <colinclark> which isn\'t quite what we want
2016-05-27T17:19:17 <gtirloni> gloob: microsoft
2016-05-27T17:19:32 <gloob> gtirloni: they are thinking about integrating with that?
2016-05-27T17:19:44 <gloob> colinclark: yes
2016-05-27T17:19:59 <gloob> gtirloni: do you have any reference for a poor guy like me?

2016-05-27T17:21:41 <gloob> BUT
2016-05-27T17:21:51 <gloob> then, we are going only tu support windows 10
2016-05-27T17:21:55 <gloob> OK, it\'s set
2016-05-27T17:22:00 <gloob> hehehe
2016-05-27T17:22:32 <gtirloni> drop old OSes then ask questions
2016-05-27T17:22:36 <gtirloni> merge PRs then ask questions
2016-05-27T17:22:41 <gtirloni> you see where this is going :)
2016-05-27T17:23:39 <gtirloni> when win10 stop being free, whever statistics about how many win10/8/7 users are out there is what it\'s going to look like for a long while, imho.
2016-05-27T17:23:50 <gtirloni> *win10 free upgrades
2016-05-27T17:23:59 <gloob> yes
2016-05-27T17:24:04 <gloob> but the main problems is
2016-05-27T17:24:30 <gloob> APCP project summary said "We are going to support every device in the world"
2016-05-27T17:24:51 <gloob> a bit daring from my point of view
2016-05-27T17:24:53 <gtirloni> that\'s certainly extremely ambitious :)
2016-05-27T17:25:03 <gloob> and impossible
2016-05-27T17:25:25 <gloob> that remember me that I need to push the survey about the AJCs
2016-05-27T17:25:34 <gtirloni> i think the "what\'s our target windows version" discussion has come up in the last 6 months or so and i honestly don\'t remember the outcome :(
2016-05-27T17:25:38 <gloob> but the initial data is not promising
2016-05-27T17:26:47 <gloob> the main problem to do the initial pilots in the AJCs is that the sample is not indicative of the desktop operative system out there
2016-05-27T17:28:09 <gloob> and you are right, gtirloni that current data is not *realistic* until end of win10 upgrades raid
2016-05-27T17:33:09 <gtirloni> no idea of the reliability of this information, only takes into account computers with web access: http://gs.statcounter.com/#desktop-os-ww-monthly-201504-201604   https://www.gosquared.com/global/

2016-05-27T17:46:27 <gtirloni> not to derail the discussion but just a last offtopic comment: it\'s funny how win8 release made no impact whatsoever on win7 users for two full years (2013/2014) -- http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_os.asp
2016-05-27T17:47:39 * lliskovoi has quit
2016-05-27T17:47:39 <gloob> no problem I think the discussion was over gtirloni
2016-05-27T17:47:48 <gloob> gtirloni: yes, windows 8 was a big mistake
2016-05-27T17:48:17 <gloob> I\'m not a windows user properly, but that weirdness of tablet user interface and start button dissapear
2016-05-27T17:48:41 <gloob> me being technically, I cannot understand it, imagine my father
2016-05-27T17:49:12 <gtirloni> assuming win7 was a successful release (that would have prompted winXP users to migrated)... it took from 2009 until 2024 for XP to reach ~5%... if the same pattern holds for win10, then maybe in 2020 win7 users will have migrated
2016-05-27T17:49:37 <gtirloni> 2009 until 2014, i meant.
2016-05-27T17:50:51 <gloob> well, microsoft is now aggressively pushing people to windows 10
2016-05-27T17:50:55 <gtirloni> if the decision to continue supporting win7 could be based on the % of users still on it, we could define a threshold.. say, when it goes below a certain %, we drop support
2016-05-27T17:51:10 <gtirloni> i think win8/8.1 is out of the picture already, or should be soon
2016-05-27T17:51:16 <gloob> but based on what statistic?
2016-05-27T17:51:24 <gtirloni> winXP+win7 ... now Win7+Win10
2016-05-27T17:51:33 <gloob> yes, win8 is pretty dead
2016-05-27T17:52:11 <gtirloni> not sure which statistics to trust.. i think all of them show each OS in the same position (1st, 2nd, etc) but the % number change a little bit.. maybe an average of all of the reports :)
2016-05-27T17:53:35 <gloob> :)
2016-05-27T17:53:57 <gloob> it sounds like a good plan
2016-05-27T17:54:53 <gtirloni> that\'s great :) if it was a bad idea, i\'d have to say it was avtar\'s idea

2016-05-27T20:12:38 <Bosmon7> Hey alanharnum - thanks for your very thorough report on FLUID-5892
2016-05-27T20:12:43 <Bosmon7> Is the failure completely consistent?
2016-05-27T20:13:20 <alanharnum> Bosmon7: yeah, completely
2016-05-27T20:13:29 <Bosmon7> alanharnum - awesome
2016-05-27T20:13:33 <Bosmon7> I\'ll investigate over the weekend
2016-05-27T20:13:39 <Bosmon7> I\'m sure we can knock this on the head :)
2016-05-27T20:14:00 <alanharnum> yeah i\'m at the point of knowing basically why it\'s happening, but not exactly where
2016-05-27T20:14:58 <alanharnum> i also think that it might be manifesting generally, but the problem isn\'t visible in non-conditional preferences panels because by the time the framework "loses track" (for lack of a better word for it) of the relevant component markup, all the event binding and such is already in place
2016-05-27T20:15:18 <alanharnum> but that after that point if you call on the framework to do something else with the component, you\'d see the same issue
2016-05-27T20:15:51 <Bosmon7> alanharnum - we often have these kinds of races with respect to the markup for a parent component for a viewComponent being blasted whilst it is constructed
2016-05-27T20:16:03 <Bosmon7> It\'s something we just have to live with until we have the "new renderer"
2016-05-27T20:16:10 <Bosmon7> But I\'m sure I can patch it up for now
2016-05-27T20:17:24 <alanharnum> another thing to note is that the problem goes away with a jQuery included in the iframe for conditional preferences panels, and the behaviour (which is in my current version of the code) of trying the panel jQuery first, then faling back to the document parent if it isn\'t there
2016-05-27T20:17:36 <alanharnum> which makes me think (but not 100% on this) that it isn\'t a race condition
2016-05-27T20:18:09 <colinclark_> avtar: I was thinking I\'d send a note to the architecture list
'

b'2016-05-27T16:50:38 <colinclark> we don\'t have to use it for everything
2016-05-27T16:51:02 <colinclark> but it\'s probably going to help a lot in terms of creating modular and testable stuff that is accessible and can be autopersonalized
2016-05-27T16:52:49 <gloob> ok, thanks for the explanation
2016-05-27T16:52:54 <gloob> so now we have, in example, PCP
2016-05-27T16:53:14 <gloob> and we have, gpii-universal, infusion and electron
2016-05-27T16:53:21 <gloob> how all match together
2016-05-27T16:53:47 <gloob> do we need infusion in that case? do we need an ui toolkit? do we need anything else?
2016-05-27T16:54:02 <colinclark> well, there\'s a part of Infusion that\'s particularly crucial
2016-05-27T16:54:07 <colinclark> which is the Preferences Framework
2016-05-27T16:54:19 <colinclark> http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/PreferencesFramework.html
2016-05-27T16:54:36 <colinclark> which we built as a tool to make it easier to make preferences editors
2016-05-27T16:54:44 <colinclark> things that give the user controls to tweak settings and preferences
2016-05-27T16:54:52 <colinclark> built specifically with the PCP, PMT, and FD Tool in mind
2016-05-27T16:55:23 <colinclark> since we\'ll need to be able to, for example, automatically render UI widgets based on a schema provided by the matchmaker, or at least configured by the user in their own preference set
2016-05-27T16:55:45 <colinclark> we may need, in addition to this, a widget library that looks platform-specific
2016-05-27T16:56:06 <colinclark> then we\'d wrap the widgets as "adjusters" in Prefs Framework parlance
2016-05-27T16:56:30 <colinclark> The Preferences Framework is the key family link between the GPII and Infusion, I guess you could say
2016-05-27T16:56:39 <gloob> so, somehow (electron+photon) <- talking to -> gpii + prefFramework
2016-05-27T16:56:46 <colinclark> yes
2016-05-27T16:56:54 <colinclark> Electron provides the app runtime
2016-05-27T16:57:01 <colinclark> we\'re going to have to assess photon very carefuly
2016-05-27T16:57:03 <colinclark> maybe it\'s great
2016-05-27T16:57:06 <gloob> yes
2016-05-27T16:57:13 <colinclark> but everyone who creates a new widget library, it\'s always the same
2016-05-27T16:57:14 <gloob> it was my first search result
2016-05-27T16:57:16 <colinclark> inaccessible, inflexible
2016-05-27T16:57:32 <colinclark> Obviously if our PCP or task tray UIs aren\'t accessible, we\'re cooked
2016-05-27T16:57:44 <colinclark> or if they freak out when they get resized or restyled
2016-05-27T16:58:00 <colinclark> this is the challenge, as you well know from experience, working in accessibility
2016-05-27T16:58:09 <colinclark> all the new hot is always actually pretty lukewarm
2016-05-27T16:58:14 <gloob> yeah
2016-05-27T16:58:18 <gloob> a11y first
2016-05-27T16:58:20 <gloob> NEVER
2016-05-27T16:58:34 <gloob> look android, best exponent of that situation
2016-05-27T16:58:40 <colinclark> hahaha
2016-05-27T16:58:41 <colinclark> yes
2016-05-27T16:58:47 <colinclark> though it\'s getting better
2016-05-27T16:58:57 <gloob> well, it\'s time
2016-05-27T16:59:01 <colinclark> what we may find is that we\'re going to need to reuse some more established widgets that have accessibility built-in
2016-05-27T16:59:03 <colinclark> like jQuery UI, say
2016-05-27T16:59:12 <colinclark> and then do some serious skinning to be platform-specific
2016-05-27T16:59:32 <colinclark> or I wonder, with "Metro" apps, if Microsoft themselves don\'t have a web UI toolkit
2016-05-27T16:59:46 <colinclark> that conforms to the Windows UI guidelines
2016-05-27T16:59:49 <colinclark> such as they are :P
2016-05-27T17:00:25 <colinclark> my reading of the situation is that we can probably be more free on Mac and Linux
2016-05-27T17:00:29 <colinclark> on Windows, there\'s politics
2016-05-27T17:00:32 <colinclark> or perceived politics
2016-05-27T17:00:35 <colinclark> around "fitting in"
2016-05-27T17:00:54 <gloob> thank you very much for this enlightenment talk, you really fill the gaps I had on my mind about all of this!!
2016-05-27T17:01:03 <colinclark> oh wow
2016-05-27T17:01:04 <colinclark> i\'m glad
2016-05-27T17:01:15 <colinclark> i\'m happy to talk about this stuff any time
2016-05-27T17:01:19 <gloob> so
2016-05-27T17:01:24 <gloob> we have extra work now
2016-05-27T17:01:32 <gloob> that could be part of the pcp project?
2016-05-27T17:02:17 <colinclark> yes, it can and should
2016-05-27T17:02:29 <colinclark> my impression is that the "app" and the PCP are pretty tightly bound
2016-05-27T17:02:39 <colinclark> at least in the sense that they depend on a lot of common infrastructure and decisions
2016-05-27T17:02:50 <colinclark> our approach to using Electron, platform specific widgets and skinning
2016-05-27T17:02:50 <colinclark> etc.
2016-05-27T17:03:00 <colinclark> when I say "the app" I mean the thing that is "the GPII app"
2016-05-27T17:03:04 <colinclark> the thing in the task tray or menu bar
2016-05-27T17:03:12 <gloob> yes, I understand it
2016-05-27T17:03:14 <colinclark> the thing that welcomes you to the GPII
2016-05-27T17:03:19 <colinclark> and tells you when you\'re keying in
2016-05-27T17:03:20 <colinclark> etc.
2016-05-27T17:03:21 <gloob> in fact, at the end, pcp is the core of the gpii app
2016-05-27T17:03:50 <colinclark> yup, exactly
2016-05-27T17:03:51 <gloob> without it, it does anything (well, it bring all the settings handler and all the gpii brain to the system)
2016-05-27T17:03:55 <colinclark> yup
2016-05-27T17:04:00 <gloob> but the interaction from the user is though pcp
2016-05-27T17:04:02 <colinclark> we really need first discovery, too
2016-05-27T17:04:05 <gloob> through}
2016-05-27T17:04:06 <colinclark> a way to quickly get set up
2016-05-27T17:04:10 <colinclark> edit some basic preferences
2016-05-27T17:04:12 <colinclark> create an account
2016-05-27T17:04:18 <colinclark> flash an nfc or usb
2016-05-27T17:04:20 <colinclark> and rock it
2016-05-27T17:04:27 <colinclark> that will come
2016-05-27T17:05:09 <gloob> Capture Tool and FDT is not the same, right?
2016-05-27T17:05:26 <gloob> capture tool just make an evaluation of the system
2016-05-27T17:05:36 <gloob> and FDT all the inital sign up, no?
2016-05-27T17:06:21 <gloob> and
2016-05-27T17:07:31 <gloob> would be great to have basics wireframes or interaction draws of all the system
2016-05-27T17:07:38 <gloob> it was the first thing I beg to Gregg
2016-05-27T17:07:44 <colinclark> not the same, but related
2016-05-27T17:07:56 <colinclark> part of FD will be to say "would you like to import settings from your computer?"
2016-05-27T17:08:10 <gloob> ok
2016-05-27T17:08:15 <colinclark> FD is supposed to be the easiest getting started experience for GPII
2016-05-27T17:08:18 <colinclark> with account setup, as you say
2016-05-27T17:08:45 <colinclark> one thing that strikes me, gloob, is that we may eventually not run the GPII in Node.js proper
2016-05-27T17:09:07 <gloob> meaning?
2016-05-27T17:09:10 <colinclark> it may be that the Flow Manager and friends are all hosted within the Electron app itself
2016-05-27T17:09:24 <colinclark> I don\'t think we\'re ready for that yet
2016-05-27T17:09:39 <colinclark> but it could well be that the Electron app is just totally self-contained
2016-05-27T17:09:47 <colinclark> at a code level, still consisting of lots of different modules
2016-05-27T17:10:07 <colinclark> but as a runtime, the app hosts the Flow Manager, the user listeners, the PCP and other UI stuff
2016-05-27T17:10:18 <colinclark> all in one self-contained package
2016-05-27T17:10:27 <colinclark> like, you know, a real application :)
2016-05-27T17:10:31 * alanharnum joined the channel
2016-05-27T17:11:00 <colinclark> which reminds me
2016-05-27T17:11:12 <colinclark> is part of SILO\'s requirements to install Node.js in a way that is self-contained?
2016-05-27T17:11:13 <gloob> is it no easier to start with remote flow manager?
2016-05-27T17:11:29 <colinclark> A flow manager always needs to be installed locally
2016-05-27T17:11:34 <gloob> colinclark: not now, but I will add to the requirements
2016-05-27T17:12:02 <gloob> ah ok, for the local part, yes
2016-05-27T17:12:09 <gloob> just checking the graph
2016-05-27T17:12:23 <colinclark> I don\'t know how Node.js can be installed on Windows in a self-contained way
2016-05-27T17:12:25 <colinclark> but it must be possible
2016-05-27T17:12:30 <gloob> maybe we can rename the local flow manager and the remote flow manager :)
2016-05-27T17:12:33 <colinclark> such that it doesn\'t interfere with any other copies that are installed
2016-05-27T17:12:41 <colinclark> well
2016-05-27T17:12:44 <colinclark> there is no remote flow manager
2016-05-27T17:12:52 <colinclark> there\'s the cloud-based flow manager
2016-05-27T17:12:56 <colinclark> not that this a better name
2016-05-27T17:13:01 <gloob> colinclark: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GPII/gpii-payloads/master/images/ArchitectureDiagram.png
2016-05-27T17:13:05 <colinclark> but the key to these components is that they\'re the same component!
2016-05-27T17:13:10 <gloob> ah
2016-05-27T17:13:10 <gloob> ok
2016-05-27T17:13:14 <colinclark> those two there
2016-05-27T17:13:20 <colinclark> with the arrow between them
2016-05-27T17:13:23 <colinclark> THEY\'RE THE SAME CODE!
2016-05-27T17:13:33 <gloob> ok
2016-05-27T17:13:37 <colinclark> you can see, this diagram resembles the old pinwheel
2016-05-27T17:13:46 <colinclark> but in a way that has been "sliced in half"
2016-05-27T17:13:54 <colinclark> each lifecycle point of the flow manager is configurable
2016-05-27T17:14:15 <colinclark> so the local flow manager in this diagram is just a configuration where preferences and matchmaking have been sliced off
2016-05-27T17:14:20 <colinclark> and delegated to the cloud-based
2016-05-27T17:14:23 <gtirloni> visual studio code supposedly ships its own node binaries
2016-05-27T17:14:28 <colinclark> which in turn is also just an ordinary flow manager
2016-05-27T17:14:37 <gloob> yes, vscode is one to look in gtirloni
2016-05-27T17:14:49 <colinclark> avtar is a big fan, i believe
2016-05-27T17:15:02 <gloob> many old school friends are moving to it
2016-05-27T17:15:21 <avtar> "big fan" :P
2016-05-27T17:15:34 <gloob> it seems the out-of-the-box readiness for supported technologies is a win
2016-05-27T17:15:36 <avtar> it has a decent js debugger
2016-05-27T17:15:47 <colinclark> as avtar and I came painfully face to face with last night
2016-05-27T17:15:47 <gloob> anyway
2016-05-27T17:15:51 <colinclark> Windows needs a package manager
2016-05-27T17:15:54 <gloob> hehe
2016-05-27T17:16:01 <gloob> well, now that they have the bash
2016-05-27T17:16:03 <colinclark> if it had a viable freaking package manager, things would be so much better
2016-05-27T17:16:10 <colinclark> gloob: sure, but that\'s not what we need
2016-05-27T17:16:11 <gloob> the could add apt-get
2016-05-27T17:16:13 <colinclark> i mean, maybe we need that
2016-05-27T17:16:13 <gtirloni> i think a pkg mgr is in the roadmap.. not sure when
2016-05-27T17:16:18 <colinclark> we need a way to install  windows apps
2016-05-27T17:16:30 <colinclark> like this 6 GB visual studio express I just had to install
2016-05-27T17:16:33 <gtirloni> i think they\'ve built an abstraction layer on top of other repositories (chocolatey, nuget, etc)
2016-05-27T17:16:40 <colinclark> <point point, click click>
'

b'2016-05-27T16:24:05 * PaliwalSparsh has quit
2016-05-27T16:24:07 <gloob> that\'s by contract
2016-05-27T16:24:14 <gloob> to support every windows version supported
2016-05-27T16:24:19 <avtar> we (alfredo, gtirloni_, or me) haven\'t had any discussions about that yet
2016-05-27T16:24:55 <gloob> we are going to find a heterogeneous environment in apcp pilots and target environments
2016-05-27T16:25:00 <gloob> avtar: about what?
2016-05-27T16:25:34 <gloob> about which windows version or how to manage differents versions?
2016-05-27T16:26:07 <avtar> about supporting windows 7, 8, and 10 (32-bit, we only have 64-bit VMs) VMs
2016-05-27T16:26:22 <gloob> ah ok
2016-05-27T16:26:33 <avtar> or how support could be implemented for all those environments in the gpii/windows repository
2016-05-27T16:26:59 <gloob> but it\'s going to be through vagrant packer generated boxes, right?
2016-05-27T16:27:43 <avtar> yes, that would be the easiest option
2016-05-27T16:28:13 <gloob> meanwhile we keep using vagrant I guess the mechanism is going to be the same
2016-05-27T16:28:21 <gloob> about windows compatibility support
2016-05-27T16:28:34 <gloob> my idea for APCP is start big and cut along the way
2016-05-27T16:28:35 <gloob> meaning
2016-05-27T16:28:47 <gloob> let\'s start supporting what the provider support
2016-05-27T16:29:04 <gloob> Microsoft is supporting from windows 7 to 10
2016-05-27T16:29:43 <gloob> that\'s going to be our big target, if for any reason, say that hotfixes, security problems in whatever windows version, we will need to justify why we are not supporting
2016-05-27T16:29:52 <gloob> and somehow push the provider to help us
2016-05-27T16:30:26 <colinclark> That has always been the approach we\'ve taken, gloob
2016-05-27T16:30:27 <gloob> obviously this needs agreement
2016-05-27T16:30:33 <gloob> great
2016-05-27T16:30:35 <colinclark> However it tends to be somewhat difficult to manage in practice
2016-05-27T16:30:41 <gloob> absolutely
2016-05-27T16:30:46 <gloob> it\'s a nightmare
2016-05-27T16:32:29 <avtar> gloob: we\'ll definitely keep using vagrant and packer but where ci is concerned we would need to figure out how to instruct vagrant to provision windows 7, 8, and 10 32-bit and 64-bit environments to test a PR or create a new version of the installer
2016-05-27T16:33:20 <avtar> so far we\'ve only been using one vm per repository and that will need to be addressed for the task you described
2016-05-27T16:33:56 <gloob> avtar: ok, right, which is your plan for that?
2016-05-27T16:34:26 <avtar> i don\'t have one at the moment :P
2016-05-27T16:34:37 <gloob> how we can speed it up? :D
2016-05-27T16:34:59 <colinclark> one could easily ask, what is SILO\'s plan for this? :P
2016-05-27T16:35:10 <gloob> they were creating new boxes
2016-05-27T16:35:21 <colinclark> or by what mechanism are you planning to direct them to a plan that is harmonized with the work the rest of the team is doing?
2016-05-27T16:35:21 <gloob> I told them to create new boxes based on the boxes we have
2016-05-27T16:35:29 <colinclark> those questions seem like good ones
2016-05-27T16:35:32 <gloob> though Alfedro
2016-05-27T16:35:38 <gloob> but
2016-05-27T16:35:43 <gloob> I mean
2016-05-27T16:35:46 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2016-05-27T16:35:47 <gloob> Last meeting with them
2016-05-27T16:35:51 <gloob> main topic was
2016-05-27T16:35:55 <gloob> Communication
2016-05-27T16:36:03 <colinclark> ha
2016-05-27T16:36:04 <gloob> they didn\'t udpate any jira ticket
2016-05-27T16:36:09 <gloob> hehe
2016-05-27T16:36:10 <colinclark> The classic meeting about how to meet
2016-05-27T16:36:11 <gloob> yes, communication
2016-05-27T16:36:17 <gloob> hehe
2016-05-27T16:36:26 * lliskovoi joined the channel
2016-05-27T16:36:40 <colinclark> On another note, gloob
2016-05-27T16:36:53 <colinclark> You mentioned some things in email yesterday that continue to mildly puzzle me
2016-05-27T16:36:57 <gloob> but I will try to improve this
2016-05-27T16:37:00 <colinclark> first, about electron packager
2016-05-27T16:37:08 <colinclark> You mentioned discussions about it
2016-05-27T16:37:15 <colinclark> but I\'ve barely heard about it
2016-05-27T16:37:26 <gloob> well, discussions with myself mostly
2016-05-27T16:37:29 <colinclark> ha!
2016-05-27T16:37:32 <colinclark> I love those
2016-05-27T16:37:33 <colinclark> :)
2016-05-27T16:37:37 <gloob> I mean
2016-05-27T16:37:46 <gloob> I had some discussion here
2016-05-27T16:37:49 <gloob> very briefly
2016-05-27T16:37:54 <colinclark> yeah, you and I talked about it very briefly
2016-05-27T16:38:07 <gloob> I also talked with Javier about
2016-05-27T16:38:22 <gloob> because he had some experiencie with the wix installer
2016-05-27T16:38:35 <colinclark> what were his thoughts?
2016-05-27T16:38:52 <gloob> to keep them using wix
2016-05-27T16:39:06 <gloob> but weeks later he though would be good to have one installer for all
2016-05-27T16:39:07 <gloob> ...
2016-05-27T16:39:07 <gloob> >/D
2016-05-27T16:39:19 <colinclark> yeah, some day that would be nice
2016-05-27T16:39:37 <colinclark> but i guess installers are very platform-specific when you\'ve got native code
2016-05-27T16:39:39 <gloob> But I confess that I\'m guilty to don\'t send two or three mails to the arch list
2016-05-27T16:39:44 <colinclark> that\'s ok
2016-05-27T16:39:50 <colinclark> i just wanted to make sure I was in the loop
2016-05-27T16:39:55 <colinclark> you asked an interesting question about widget libraries
2016-05-27T16:40:00 <gtirloni_> fyi: finally figured out what was wrong with updating the static jenkins website, it\'s fixed now. sorry it took so long but i\'ve been distracted with other issues. this address works for unauthenticated access: https://ci.gpii.net
2016-05-27T16:40:01 <colinclark> what was that one called?
2016-05-27T16:40:09 <colinclark> gtirloni_: YOU RULE
2016-05-27T16:40:09 <gloob> photon?
2016-05-27T16:40:14 <colinclark> yes, i guess that was it
2016-05-27T16:40:15 <avtar> gtirloni_: thanks!
2016-05-27T16:40:16 * gtirloni_ is now known as gtirloni
2016-05-27T16:40:34 * lliskovoi has quit
2016-05-27T16:40:46 <gloob> but
2016-05-27T16:40:56 <gloob> from my point of view we are going to start using menubar
2016-05-27T16:41:05 <colinclark> ?
2016-05-27T16:41:14 <gloob> https://github.com/maxogden/menubar
2016-05-27T16:41:25 <gloob> but I think this doesn\'t have "ui toolkit" inside
2016-05-27T16:41:42 <gloob> it\'s an electron component for create main bar items
2016-05-27T16:41:47 <colinclark> max ogden is a very good programmer
2016-05-27T16:41:54 <gloob> no idea
2016-05-27T16:42:06 <gloob> I\'m very out of the JS world (yet) :P
2016-05-27T16:42:10 <colinclark> yeah
2016-05-27T16:42:16 <colinclark> I guess there was some confusion
2016-05-27T16:42:21 <colinclark> Infusion isn\'t really a widget library
2016-05-27T16:42:31 <colinclark> so the question of "Infusion or Photon" doesn\'t really make much sense
2016-05-27T16:42:46 <gloob> and fluid?
2016-05-27T16:42:55 <colinclark> I\'m not sure what that means
2016-05-27T16:42:59 <colinclark> Fluid is a community
2016-05-27T16:43:02 <gloob> I still have some confussion about fluid and infusion
2016-05-27T16:43:06 <colinclark> like this: http://fluidproject.org/
2016-05-27T16:43:08 <gloob> that\'s right
2016-05-27T16:43:17 * lliskovoi joined the channel
2016-05-27T16:43:23 <colinclark> Infusion is a JavaScript application framework
2016-05-27T16:43:25 <colinclark> like this: http://fluidproject.org/infusion.html
2016-05-27T16:43:53 <gloob> ok, got it
2016-05-27T16:44:01 <gloob> but reading infusion description is what confuse me
2016-05-27T16:44:02 <gloob> Good interfaces should be easy to use and easy to build. Infusion takes the pain out of developing accessible, high performance, clean and nimble front-ends for applications that want to do more. Our approach is to leave you in control - it\'s your interface, using your markup, your way.
2016-05-27T16:44:13 <colinclark> yes, well
2016-05-27T16:44:16 <gloob> so
2016-05-27T16:44:24 <gloob> it\'s a system to create ui toolkits?
2016-05-27T16:44:31 <colinclark> if you\'re interesting in contributing new copy, we welcome pull requests :)
2016-05-27T16:44:35 <colinclark> It\'s an application framework
2016-05-27T16:44:36 <gloob> hahaha
2016-05-27T16:44:44 <colinclark> it\'s a set of libraries and tools for building apps
2016-05-27T16:44:46 * lliskovoi has quit
2016-05-27T16:44:47 <gloob> don\'t tempt the beast
2016-05-27T16:44:50 <colinclark> hahaha
2016-05-27T16:45:01 <gloob> ok
2016-05-27T16:45:06 <gloob> so somehow like an electron
2016-05-27T16:45:06 <colinclark> most notably, for handling the relationships between components in an application
2016-05-27T16:45:08 <gloob> right?
2016-05-27T16:45:10 <colinclark> no
2016-05-27T16:45:16 <colinclark> nothing like electron, thankfully
2016-05-27T16:45:22 * lliskovoi joined the channel
2016-05-27T16:45:26 <colinclark> something like a, I don\'t know, Ember or Angular or Backbone
2016-05-27T16:45:34 <gloob> aha, ok
2016-05-27T16:45:53 <gloob> more like ember probably
2016-05-27T16:45:57 <colinclark> a bit, yes
2016-05-27T16:45:59 <gloob> but ok
2016-05-27T16:46:01 <gloob> ok ok
2016-05-27T16:46:08 <colinclark> it\'s the part that takes care of instantiating components, managing events, handling models and views
2016-05-27T16:46:11 <colinclark> that kind of thing
2016-05-27T16:46:13 <colinclark> we do have a few widgets
2016-05-27T16:46:15 <gloob> gotcha
2016-05-27T16:46:27 <colinclark> but people most often than not use other widgets
2016-05-27T16:46:40 <colinclark> maybe wrap them up so they can fire Infusion events and participate in the model system
2016-05-27T16:46:50 <gloob> so, how this mix with gpii
2016-05-27T16:46:54 <colinclark> we have wrappers for a number of jQuery UI widgets, for example
2016-05-27T16:47:00 <gloob> that\'s what is missing in my mental map
2016-05-27T16:47:08 <colinclark> well, Infusion is something that we\'ve found useful to the GPII
2016-05-27T16:47:25 <colinclark> so it\'s used extensively throughout the autopersonalization framework
2016-05-27T16:47:28 <colinclark> and to good effect
2016-05-27T16:47:44 <colinclark> you might think of Infusion and th GPIi as cousins or something
2016-05-27T16:48:03 <gloob> yes, I understand that one born based in one needs in the another one
2016-05-27T16:48:12 <gloob> need*
2016-05-27T16:50:22 <colinclark> yup
2016-05-27T16:50:34 <colinclark> Infusion is something we use a lot in the GPII

2016-05-27T15:42:37 <avtar> Bosmon7, colinclark: just confirming that gpii/windows still needs node.js 32-bit and not 64-bit?
2016-05-27T15:43:28 <colinclark> that\'s an interesting question, avtar
2016-05-27T15:43:54 <colinclark> Disturbingly, sgithens suggested that we may well have problems that arise only on 64-bit Windows 10
2016-05-27T15:44:14 <colinclark> but the thing that worries me is that all of this seems just "lore"
2016-05-27T15:44:36 <colinclark> oh i just read your not more closely
2016-05-27T15:44:43 <colinclark> I think we should be fine with any version of Node.js now
2016-05-27T15:44:48 * alanharnum joined the channel
2016-05-27T15:44:53 <colinclark> whichever is appropriate for the architecture
2016-05-27T15:44:55 <colinclark> of the VM
2016-05-27T15:47:08 <avtar> ok we had pinned the build scripts to the 32-bit version but google is suggesting that that means we might need a 32-bit release of python https://github.com/node-ffi/node-ffi/issues/280#issuecomment-182280279
2016-05-27T15:47:44 <colinclark> i can\'t be sure, avtar, but I think it\'s reasonable, in the abstract, to use the versions appropriate for the architecture of the VM
2016-05-27T15:47:56 <avtar> ok i\'ll give that a shot
2016-05-27T15:48:00 <avtar> thanks
2016-05-27T15:58:45 <Justin_o> My navigating issue with VoiceOver was solved by resetting all the VoiceOver preferences. I guess I must have changed something by accident

2016-05-27T15:59:21 <Justin_o> jhung: also the alert in a static element seems to work.. still don\'t get it in FF and Chrome with VoiceOver, but it seems to work everywhere else.

2016-05-27T16:10:36 <colinclark> I have a couple of questions about the installer if you have a second
2016-05-27T16:10:44 <gloob> shoot
2016-05-27T16:11:05 <colinclark> Will SILO\'s installer automatically install the Windows hotfix required on some versions of Windows for high contrast mode?
2016-05-27T16:11:45 * gtirloni has quit
2016-05-27T16:12:58 <gloob> https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-1712
2016-05-27T16:12:59 <gloob> no
2016-05-27T16:13:13 <gloob> in fact, its the first time I hear that need :(
2016-05-27T16:13:29 <colinclark> gloob: https://github.com/gpii/windows#gpii-for-windows
2016-05-27T16:13:35 * sepidehshahi has quit
2016-05-27T16:13:36 <colinclark> It\'s been in the README for a long time
2016-05-27T16:13:39 <colinclark> Second question
2016-05-27T16:13:46 <colinclark> How will we handle builds with the installer?
2016-05-27T16:14:00 <colinclark> Presumably the installer will install binaries onto the user\'s system
2016-05-27T16:14:16 <colinclark> thus avoiding the need to install a Windows build toolchain on a user\'s computer
2016-05-27T16:14:29 <colinclark> so the question I was thinking about yesterday as I was testing with VMs and the like
2016-05-27T16:14:46 <gloob> probably that hotfixes stuff is more interesting in the "Installer AT on demand" thing
2016-05-27T16:14:57 <colinclark> gloob: no, it\'s required for the system simply to work
2016-05-27T16:15:10 <colinclark> if that hotfix isn\'t installed, at least on Windows 7 and 8, the GPII won\'t work correctly
2016-05-27T16:15:24 <colinclark> Regarding builds and binaries, will we have some kind of CI-integrated Windows build bots that build versions of the GPII binaries for each OS and architecture?
2016-05-27T16:15:39 <colinclark> i.e. built versions for Windows 7, 8, 10 for both 32-bit and 64-bit?
2016-05-27T16:15:46 <colinclark> and if so, how will this be done?
2016-05-27T16:16:06 <gloob> yes, I understand that, but when we are going to install in a controlled environment the administrators needs to validate what is going to be installed, anyhow I don\'t see so much problem to add that hotfixes to the installer
2016-05-27T16:16:25 <gloob> yes, through jenkins
2016-05-27T16:16:39 <colinclark> how will it work?
2016-05-27T16:16:40 <colinclark> who is implementing it?
2016-05-27T16:16:42 <gloob> and tested in vms with differents windows version
2016-05-27T16:16:44 <gloob> silo
2016-05-27T16:16:52 <gloob> with alfredo\'s help
2016-05-27T16:17:04 <colinclark> Did they receive any requirements or specifications on how this needs to be done?
2016-05-27T16:18:04 * gloob has quit
2016-05-27T16:18:13 <colinclark> I scared Alejandro away, apparently :)
2016-05-27T16:18:40 * gloob joined the channel
2016-05-27T16:18:59 <gloob> very rough as defined here https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-1731 and here https://wiki.gpii.net/w/Installers
2016-05-27T16:20:10 <gloob> meaning that we want windows 7, 8 and 10 support, x86 and x64 in the beginning
2016-05-27T16:20:31 <gloob> it should be integrated as jenkin job for every windows version to create the installer binaries
2016-05-27T16:21:08 <gloob> because it\'s everything so open I want them (silo) to have a dialogue with us for every requirement along the way
2016-05-27T16:22:00 <colinclark> I\'d like to make sure that either gtirloni_ or avtar are consulted
2016-05-27T16:22:07 <gloob> now they are checking how to use the gio\'s vm boxes (done through packer) to integrate with they automatic building
2016-05-27T16:22:07 <colinclark> hopefully they will produce some kind of proposed approach
2016-05-27T16:22:51 <gloob> sure, Alfredo is acting as a proxy and I know that he is finally consulting with gtirloni_and avtar
2016-05-27T16:23:09 <gloob> the current approach is the same they are building for gpii core
2016-05-27T16:23:44 <gloob> but, for sure we will add gtirloni_and avtar or anyone on demand, sure
2016-05-27T16:23:51 <avtar> win10 x64 is what we currently use but it would be awesome to offer more environments
2016-05-27T16:24:00 <gloob> absolutely
