2016-05-24T15:49:47 <Justin_o> he created a repo on GitHub
2016-05-24T15:52:50 <danayo> thanks Justin_o
2016-05-24T15:53:12 <colinclark> alanharnum: Your GPII demo summary looks great
2016-05-24T15:53:16 <colinclark> sounds like it will be a fun demo

2016-05-24T15:54:02 <danayo> but alanharnum, what will you wear?
2016-05-24T15:54:02 <alanharnum> 90 seconds is a good constraint for "elevator pitch" level of information
2016-05-24T15:54:18 <alanharnum> danayo: I\'ve actually been instructed to wear mostly black if possible
2016-05-24T15:54:38 <danayo> :)

2016-05-24T19:28:15 <PaliwalSparsh> @alanharnum Please can you have a look at this https://github.com/PaliwalSparsh/Discovery-Cat
2016-05-24T19:47:01 <Justin_o> alanharnum: did you see that ^
2016-05-24T19:48:47 <alanharnum> Paliwalsparsh: neat - that\'s a good beginning wrapper
2016-05-24T19:50:21 <PaliwalSparsh> alanharnum Justin_o : This is what we aim to achieve please have a look at it https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/tree/master/resources/Project%20Templates/Basic
2016-05-24T19:52:30 <PaliwalSparsh> In phaser each level is a state and all we need to do is create a object for that state that includes all the details of the level, and attach them to the that.game object which I have created till now in the Discovery-Cat.
2016-05-24T19:53:20 <alanharnum> I think that looks like a pretty good start to an Infusion component that wraps Phaser, PaliwalSparsh - you\'ve got the use of events/listeners/invokers, the configuration details definable as part of the component, etc
2016-05-24T19:53:20 * amatas joined the channel
2016-05-24T19:53:31 <alanharnum> nice work!
2016-05-24T19:53:53 <PaliwalSparsh> happy to hear that :) Thankyou for all the help
2016-05-24T19:55:43 * kasparnet joined the channel
2016-05-24T20:02:18 <PaliwalSparsh> alanharnum: Next what I was going to do that i was going to implement all the levels of the game by defining each level as a subcomponent to the fluid.phaser.game thereitself, but I guess Justin_o had some concerns
2016-05-24T20:02:19 <PaliwalSparsh> https://botbot.me/freenode/fluid-work/2016-05-24/?msg=66618811&page=1
2016-05-24T20:02:30 <PaliwalSparsh> this is the conversation we had
2016-05-24T20:04:33 * clown_mtg has quit
2016-05-24T20:04:57 <alanharnum> Yeah, I\'d agree with Justin_o - you\'d want to keep the wrapper clean of things related to your specific game like that.
2016-05-24T20:05:36 <alanharnum> Rather, you\'d want another component that uses that wrapper as a grade, or similar.
2016-05-24T20:08:17 <alanharnum> it also might or might not be appropriate to implement game levels as subcomponents like that - it depends on what the intended interactions are, and what data each level needs to contain.

2016-05-24T13:01:14 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: hello, starting to look over your repo https://github.com/PaliwalSparsh/Discovery-Cat
2016-05-24T13:01:37 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: i\'ll mention things here as I see them.
2016-05-24T13:02:09 <PaliwalSparsh> great
2016-05-24T13:02:14 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: comments aren\'t valid in JSON, which is why you are getting those red highlights for them in GitHub https://github.com/PaliwalSparsh/Discovery-Cat/blob/master/.jshintrc
2016-05-24T13:04:03 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: you may want to mention phaser and javascript in your keywords
2016-05-24T13:06:16 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: you should add a license, we\'ve been using BSD-3 lately. Make sure to add this to the package.json and license file to the repo.
2016-05-24T13:08:11 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: infusion-all.js includes jQuery. You don\'t need to add it separately.
2016-05-24T13:09:53 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: it\'s probably better to keep your code organized with directories.. for example instead of src/phaser-infusion.js you should do src/js/phaser-infusion.js for example.. this might have to be expanded even more depending on what code you add. Similarly, in lib you should put directories for the the library, and then by type of file.. so
2016-05-24T13:09:53 <Justin_o> src/lib/infusion/js/infusion-all.js
2016-05-24T13:10:17 <Justin_o> also make sure you add the licences for each of these in their directories as well
2016-05-24T13:14:15 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: you don\'t have to do the fluid_2_0_0 version namespace as you are making use of infusion and not adding to Infusion. https://github.com/PaliwalSparsh/Discovery-Cat/blob/master/src/phaser-infusion.js#L1 You should be able to just bind against fluid directy as you\'ll be pulling it in and this namespace is already defined.
2016-05-24T13:15:09 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: you could leave this as fluid_2_0_0 if you only want to work with Infusion 2.0.0 but you may want to just switch this to "fluid"
2016-05-24T13:16:33 <Justin_o> I\'d suggest not using an ID here. Use a class instead, it will be scoped to the container you use when initializing the component. Also by using a class, someone could create a page that has multiple games on it. Which might be necessary for some integrations.
2016-05-24T13:19:12 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: "onCreate" events are automatically added and fired by the framework. You don\'t need to do that https://github.com/PaliwalSparsh/Discovery-Cat/blob/master/src/phaser-infusion.js#L23
2016-05-24T13:23:21 <PaliwalSparsh> I used onCreate with the intention to create the game object as soon as i would instantiate the fluid.phaser.game component in the "index.html", but would surely change it for the whatever the correct practice is.
2016-05-24T13:24:01 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: that\'s fine, you just don\'t need to have it in the events block
2016-05-24T13:24:47 * anvk joined the channel
2016-05-24T13:26:25 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: also you should use a namespace on your event listener. That way it can be overridden if needed and also for setting priorities / order of event listeners.
2016-05-24T13:26:49 <Justin_o> so instead of just writing onCreate: "fluid.phaser.game.createGameObject"
2016-05-24T13:27:43 <Justin_o> you\'d write something like "onCreate.createGameObject": "fluid.phaser.game.createGameObject"
2016-05-24T13:29:06 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: i don\'t think you\'d want to add the specific game features here. https://github.com/PaliwalSparsh/Discovery-Cat/blob/master/src/phaser-infusion.js#L28-L33
2016-05-24T13:29:37 <Justin_o> I think you want to keep this as a wrapper to make use of phaser through infusion. Then you could use an instance of this when actually creating your game.
2016-05-24T13:29:42 <Justin_o> PaliwalSparsh: did that make sense?

2016-05-24T13:54:21 <PaliwalSparsh> @Justin_o I was about to add all the features and parts here as subcompenents only and finally add them all to the main that.game object I created. I guess this would need a discussion then.
2016-05-24T13:54:35 <PaliwalSparsh> with "that.game object I created" I meant "that.game which is created(onCreate) on instantiating fluid.phaser.game".
