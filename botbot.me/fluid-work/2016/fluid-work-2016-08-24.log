b'2016-08-24T15:45:21 <Bosmon> But I imagine this can\'t always be achieved
2016-08-24T15:46:45 <Bosmon> Justin_o - given the prefs framework is sufficiently schematised, my suggestion is that you shift this work into Builder.js
2016-08-24T15:46:53 <Bosmon> Even though this is already quite a mess
2016-08-24T15:47:21 <Bosmon> It\'s not really clear that we have a way, from within the implementation of a panel, to discover information about its primary and aux schema?
2016-08-24T15:48:24 <Bosmon> Justin_o - do you know why this namespace is "fluid.prefs.constructed"?

2016-08-24T15:51:41 <Justin_o> Bosmon: so the example i sent is used by the grade version of the prefs framework
2016-08-24T15:51:52 <Bosmon> Yes
2016-08-24T15:52:24 <Bosmon> I think we need to rethink this so-called "grade version" since the implementation really needs the schematic information available
2016-08-24T15:53:31 <Bosmon> Is it really not available?
2016-08-24T15:53:40 <Bosmon> I\'ve somewhat forgotten what the workflow of AuxBuilder.js really is

2016-08-24T16:54:55 <Justin_o> Bosmon: regarding the grade version of the prefs framework, it does have better performance as you can skip all of the schema parsing
2016-08-24T16:55:14 <Bosmon> Justin_o - have you evaluated the performance increase? : P
2016-08-24T16:55:26 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes, actually ;)

2016-08-24T16:58:32 <Bosmon> Justin_o - that\'s interesting
2016-08-24T16:58:32 <Justin_o> Bosmon: well that was specifically with the page enhancer, so doesn\'t include the prefs editor
2016-08-24T16:58:47 <Justin_o> which you might be more interested in
2016-08-24T16:59:24 <Bosmon> Looks like about 80ms extra time in "scripting"
2016-08-24T17:00:02 <Bosmon> I think your "fastest out of 10 runs" methodology might lead to more noise in the measurements
2016-08-24T17:00:30 <Bosmon> A median approach is more standard in these cases - for example, discard the fastest 1 or 2 fastest and slowest measurements and average the rest
2016-08-24T17:00:42 <Justin_o> Bosmon: why so?
2016-08-24T17:00:48 <Justin_o> i guess i\'d have liked to have run it 1000 times or more but it took too long for each run and was manual
2016-08-24T17:01:07 <gloob> Bosmon: ok, I don\'t know if we are going to need the meeting anyway
2016-08-24T17:01:18 <gloob> Bosmon: need to check the full case
2016-08-24T17:01:25 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i use the fastest to try to remove the times my computer was doing something that slowed it down
2016-08-24T17:01:26 <gloob> Bosmon: so probably is ok

2016-08-24T17:03:16 <Bosmon> 1000 is rather overkill
2016-08-24T17:03:23 <Bosmon> Justin_o - here is a "best practices" guide :)

2016-08-24T17:03:32 * gtirloni_ has quit
2016-08-24T17:03:35 <Bosmon> You are trying to maximise the value of your data collection
2016-08-24T17:03:47 <Bosmon> So throwing away 90% of the data is inefficient
2016-08-24T17:03:51 * gtirloni_ joined the channel
2016-08-24T17:04:14 <Bosmon> Some kind of median or percentile-based scheme maximises the value of the data whilst being resistant to outliers
2016-08-24T17:04:42 <Bosmon> The idea of "it was doing something that slowed it down" only captures some of the potential variability in the process you are trying to measure

2016-08-24T12:54:50 <cindyli> nitkul: infusion has different but connected naming conventions for namespaces used in the code and in html

2016-08-24T12:57:41 * danayo joined the channel
2016-08-24T12:57:45 <cindyli> for instance, if your code is using namespace such as "fluid.myProject", the css namespaces used in the html has 2 forms. one would use "flc-" namespaces which are for js code to identify html elements. the other would be "fl-" which is for styling selectors
2016-08-24T12:57:50 <cindyli> nitkul: ^

2016-08-24T14:10:06 <kasparne_> ANTWARRNNING!
2016-08-24T14:10:28 <kasparne_> So I managed to overwrite the defaults of the prefs editor
2016-08-24T14:10:42 <kasparne_> but I got a different problem now
2016-08-24T14:11:06 <kasparne_> .. the preferences I want to use, are requested from the preferences server
2016-08-24T14:11:18 <kasparne_> which is asynchronous
2016-08-24T14:11:37 <kasparne_> the way I had implemented things were like so (in my new grade):
2016-08-24T14:11:49 <kasparne_> distributeOptions: {
2016-08-24T14:11:52 <kasparne_> record: {
2016-08-24T14:11:52 <kasparne_> expander: {
2016-08-24T14:11:52 <kasparne_> func: "{that}.loadTokenPreferences",
2016-08-24T14:11:52 <kasparne_> args: []
2016-08-24T14:11:54 <kasparne_> }
2016-08-24T14:11:57 <kasparne_> },
2016-08-24T14:11:58 <kasparne_> target: "{that}.options.members.initialModel.preferences"
2016-08-24T14:12:00 <kasparne_> },
2016-08-24T14:12:12 <kasparne_> but in loadTokenPreferences, I\'m doing an ajax call to the prefs server, which is asynchronous
2016-08-24T14:12:40 <kasparne_> ... is there a simple/clever way to get values from promises/async functions in default/distributeOptions blocks?

2016-08-24T14:14:28 <Bosmon> kasparne_ - of course not
2016-08-24T14:15:19 <Justin_o> Bosmon: would you like to take a look at this PR to fix an issue with fluid-grunt-eslint https://github.com/fluid-project/fluid-grunt-eslint/pull/1
2016-08-24T14:15:28 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, I will look at it
2016-08-24T14:15:41 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks, it\'s pretty small so hopefully won\'t take long
2016-08-24T14:16:08 <Bosmon> kasparne_ - you\'ll have to stick your fetch up here
2016-08-24T14:16:17 <Bosmon> Which is where we stuff all asynchronous stuff in the prefs framework
2016-08-24T14:16:40 <Bosmon> And then override the giant BOILING BLOCK at https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/preferences/js/PrefsEditor.js#L79 to wait on one more thing
2016-08-24T14:17:09 <Bosmon> There is now one more thing in the world preventing me from rewriting the framework but perhaps I will still get to it someday
2016-08-24T14:20:31 <kasparne_> Bosmon: awesome - thanks Bosmon
2016-08-24T14:25:34 <godfrey_> hi danayo and sepidehshahi: we took a look through the comments and made some changes. If you have time could you please take another look through the edits.

2016-08-24T15:12:49 <Justin_o> we\'ll likely use fluid-publish for releasing infusion 2.0

2016-08-24T15:28:12 <cindyli> avtar: problems resolved. "vagrant up" now starts all node instances. also the additional data loading works perfectly. thanks for the fix
2016-08-24T15:29:20 <avtar> awesome :)
2016-08-24T15:30:06 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i have a listener namespace question
2016-08-24T15:30:21 <Justin_o> so if i declare a listener like this
2016-08-24T15:30:32 <Justin_o> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/TTOB8xKh/
2016-08-24T15:30:38 <Bosmon> Hey, avtar, colinclark - how completely awesome is it - that we have a COMPLETELY UPDATED WINDOWS 10 box, that runs and passes all our architecture tests?
2016-08-24T15:30:54 <colinclark> it is very awesome
2016-08-24T15:30:57 <avtar> Bosmon: really awesome :D
2016-08-24T15:31:04 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i assume that this actually creates a listener on the component on the left side with the specified namespace
2016-08-24T15:31:05 <Bosmon> Yes, I think that\'s right
2016-08-24T15:31:09 <Bosmon> Justin_o - that\'s correct, yes
2016-08-24T15:31:11 <colinclark> avtar: you know you rock, right?
2016-08-24T15:31:35 <avtar> one is glad to be of service
2016-08-24T15:31:47 <Justin_o> Bosmon: so i have a case where it\'s in a grade that gets added to lots of subcomponents.. so i can\'t namespace it because they all just override each other instead of adding new ones
2016-08-24T15:32:49 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i take it that in that specific case it doesn\'t make sense to use a namespace, but i suppose it\'s not always obvious how grades may be used and could cause an issue with this form of listener definition
2016-08-24T15:33:47 <Bosmon> Justin_o - well, this is actually a pretty interesting issue

2016-08-24T15:44:44 <Bosmon> Justin_o - it\'s sufficiently interesting I\'ve written it up as https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5948
2016-08-24T15:45:15 <Bosmon> My first suggestion is to achieve all of this via model listeners binding to local bits of model
