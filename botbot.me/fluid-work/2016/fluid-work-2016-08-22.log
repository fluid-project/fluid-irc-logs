2016-08-22T20:27:31 <simonjb> I enjoy also in bilingual signage like in Ottawa last week -- Centre Shaw Centre
2016-08-22T20:27:32 <Bosmon7> Our Greek colleagues on C4A introduced us to this classical quantity named "philotimo" which is apparently "better than decency"
2016-08-22T20:28:04 <Bosmon7> Yes, I was excited when visiting LA to find signs to "The La Brea Tar Pits"

2016-08-22T20:52:36 <avtar> fluid-everyone: the license for the idi windows 10 vagrant box will expire in 4 days so a new box needs to be built to replace the old one. during that provisioning process a few critical packages such as the windows 8.1 sdk and build tools (required by node-gyp) fail to get installed using chocolatey because the files are being served by microsoft without
2016-08-22T20:52:36 <avtar> tls (oracle is doing the same with their jre)
2016-08-22T20:53:28 <avtar> it\'s possible to workaround it by disabling verification for select packages https://www.pastery.net/jmywvn/raw/
2016-08-22T20:54:48 <avtar> i should clarify, non-tls urls are being used by ms and oracle chocolatey packages
2016-08-22T20:56:39 <colinclark> that is quite a drag, avtar
2016-08-22T20:56:42 <avtar> we can raise this issue with package maintainers but in the meantime we\'ll need to use this "--allow-empty-checksums" option to get a box ready before the license expires
2016-08-22T20:56:50 <colinclark> windows needs a real pacakge manager, doesn\'t it?
2016-08-22T20:56:55 <avtar> yup
2016-08-22T20:57:28 <colinclark> so why wasn\'t this a problem before, avtar?
2016-08-22T20:59:38 <avtar> colinclark: i\'ll have to confirm after the box is built but my guesses would be either chocolatey\'s behaviour changed or (more likely) package manifests were updated with non-https urls

2016-08-22T21:05:40 <colinclark> so any proposals on what to do, avtar?
2016-08-22T21:06:23 * sepidehshahi has quit
2016-08-22T21:08:53 <avtar> for now we\'ll probably need to use the http urls so that the new box will contain all the bits required for ci jobs
2016-08-22T21:09:45 <colinclark> yeah, it makes sense

2016-08-22T21:20:05 <Bosmon7> alanharnum - I didn\'t mean you to rename the function, but one of its arguments
2016-08-22T21:20:15 <Bosmon7> You had an argument named "promise" which is actually "a function returning a promise"

2016-08-22T21:34:58 <colinclark> avtar: You\'d think they\'d accompany this fix with, well, you know, some community support and incentives
2016-08-22T21:35:31 <colinclark> I guess it\'s just a lot easier to make an executive decision and push it to your repository than to work with your community to address its systemic issues

2016-08-22T18:59:02 <Justin_o> any thoughts on that?
2016-08-22T18:59:16 <alanharnum> hm
2016-08-22T18:59:41 <alanharnum> i agree it doesn\'t look great
2016-08-22T19:00:09 <alanharnum> the text above it in the table should probably be in a paragraph or similar
2016-08-22T19:01:47 <Justin_o> alanharnum: you might be able to just adjust the margins when it is in a table
2016-08-22T19:02:21 <alanharnum> yeah it\'s
2016-08-22T19:02:33 * bens__ has quit
2016-08-22T19:03:13 <alanharnum> i could put in an additional directive when it\'s inside a table, but worry that was CSS dependency hell lies
2016-08-22T19:04:02 <alanharnum> and wrapping the text in paragraph tags changes the font style
2016-08-22T19:05:42 <Justin_o> alanharnum: intersting about the paragraph styling.. maybe it\'s a foundation.css thing
2016-08-22T19:05:47 <alanharnum> nope
2016-08-22T19:06:04 <Justin_o> alanharnum: i\'d hope that making the change to the note style in the table wouldn\'t cause too much issue though...

2016-08-22T19:48:13 <Bosmon7> Since the branch is now polluted by having both of our work in it, one of you could take it on
2016-08-22T20:02:56 <simonjb> thanks Bosmon7 -- just reading https://github.com/substack/node-resolve/issues/106 now
2016-08-22T20:03:18 <Bosmon7> Cheers simonjb
2016-08-22T20:03:23 <simonjb> so it looks like it\'s a little different from what I was first seeing -- that it involves CWD
2016-08-22T20:03:23 <Bosmon7> It\'s a truly appalling issue
2016-08-22T20:03:33 <Bosmon7> simonjb - it is the same issue that you were seeing
2016-08-22T20:03:36 <Bosmon7> Just a bit more fully characterised
2016-08-22T20:03:47 <simonjb> yes
2016-08-22T20:04:18 <Bosmon7> "it just so happens" that in all the trial sequences we had tried, the shell\'s cwd just happened to be the project itself that had infusion as a dependency
2016-08-22T20:04:27 <simonjb> right
2016-08-22T20:04:42 <simonjb> very interesting
2016-08-22T20:04:49 <Bosmon7> And as a result the bogus resolve logic would resolve to that particular infusion, that is, what we called "ourselves"
2016-08-22T20:05:10 <Bosmon7> But with the resolve bug in place, we could in theory resolve to any infusion in the entire filesystem
2016-08-22T20:05:22 <Bosmon7> Just by having our parent as our cwd : P
2016-08-22T20:05:27 <Bosmon7> its parent
2016-08-22T20:05:51 <simonjb> is there any way that this is on purpose?
2016-08-22T20:05:56 <simonjb> seems unlikely
2016-08-22T20:06:01 <Bosmon7> No
2016-08-22T20:06:23 <Bosmon7> For a start, i) it could only happen on Windows, and then ii) it is totally contrary to the documented behaviour for node module resolution
2016-08-22T20:06:45 * bens__ joined the channel
2016-08-22T20:06:50 <Bosmon7> It stems from the "node resolve" developer being ignorant as to the meaning of a path like "c:vagrant" as opposed to "c:\\vagrant" on Windows
2016-08-22T20:06:58 <Bosmon7> of course any sane person would assume these to be the same
2016-08-22T20:07:32 <Bosmon7> But as anyone who has been using this insane shell since the days of MS-DOS 3.3 knows, they are not
2016-08-22T20:08:40 <Bosmon7> Well, actually "c:node_modules" is the kind of path in question
2016-08-22T20:09:01 <simonjb> yes, you have per-drive cwd right? am I remembering right?
2016-08-22T20:09:09 <Bosmon7> simonjb - yes, that\'s correct
2016-08-22T20:09:25 <simonjb> and without the leading \'\\\' it\'s relative to the cwd for that drive?
2016-08-22T20:09:32 <Bosmon7> simonjb - exactly
2016-08-22T20:09:36 <Bosmon7> It\'s total, total insanity
2016-08-22T20:09:37 <simonjb> :(
2016-08-22T20:09:48 <Bosmon7> The kind of insanity that comes from "assisting people to save keystrokes sometimes" : P
2016-08-22T20:10:03 <Bosmon7> I feel that COFFESCRIPT is an example of the same kind of insanity, but there it is : P
2016-08-22T20:10:33 <simonjb> so you could do stuff like copy *.* b:
2016-08-22T20:10:54 <simonjb> and copy to the current dir of your second floppy
2016-08-22T20:11:24 <Bosmon7> Yes exactly
2016-08-22T20:11:28 <Bosmon7> That is precisely what you would do :)
2016-08-22T20:11:50 <simonjb> it\'s amazing that we still use drive letters in Windows

2016-08-22T20:12:01 <Bosmon7> Yes it is

2016-08-22T20:12:34 <simonjb> it makes some sense when they map to physical devices like floppy disk drives
2016-08-22T20:12:35 <Bosmon7> At one point I had drives up to X: continuously

2016-08-22T20:22:46 <Bosmon7> Yes, Greek-derived words are always more stylish than Latin

2016-08-22T14:15:27 <the-t-in-rtf> Sorry, still wrapping up the previous meeting.
2016-08-22T14:15:28 <the-t-in-rtf> Just a minute.
2016-08-22T14:15:55 <avtar> ok
2016-08-22T14:18:31 <the-t-in-rtf> @avtar, your room?
2016-08-22T14:19:43 <colinclark> hey look, avtar\'s back
2016-08-22T14:19:46 <colinclark> so great :)
2016-08-22T14:20:14 <the-t-in-rtf> oh, wait.  I have a room!
2016-08-22T14:20:27 <the-t-in-rtf> I have opened my room.
2016-08-22T14:20:40 <the-t-in-rtf> @avtar @gtirloni, my Vidyo room is open.
2016-08-22T14:21:14 <amatas> the-t-in-rtf, I see the room closed
2016-08-22T14:22:33 <avtar> the-t-in-rtf: same
2016-08-22T14:22:36 <the-t-in-rtf> I invited all three of you.
2016-08-22T14:22:39 <avtar> colinclark: hi :)
2016-08-22T14:22:52 <gtirloni> the-t-in-rtf: in your room, the leftmost icon to show participants, then you\'ll see a little lock icon on the bottom left corner. OR if you\'ve not joined your room, right click it from the contact list and it should show the lock icon too
2016-08-22T14:22:54 <the-t-in-rtf> is it the little lock?
2016-08-22T14:23:05 <the-t-in-rtf> I just clicked the little lock a minute ago.
2016-08-22T14:23:11 <gtirloni> it\'s open now
2016-08-22T14:23:20 <the-t-in-rtf> sorry, rookie mistake.
2016-08-22T14:23:26 <amatas> room pin required :(
2016-08-22T14:24:20 <gtirloni> right click room, click the "..." button, it should show options to remove/set the pin

2016-08-22T14:45:11 <alanharnum> Justin_o: nope - the FLUID-5936 PR fixes some testing bugs and reliability issues, but doesn\'t change the "public" interface in any way
2016-08-22T14:45:31 <Justin_o> alanharnum: great thanks.. i\'m looking at the Infusion-Docs PR now.. hope to get it in today
2016-08-22T14:45:39 <alanharnum> thanks Justin_o
2016-08-22T14:45:51 <gtirloni> the-t-in-rtf: we\'re in your room
2016-08-22T14:46:17 <alanharnum> I think the FLUID-5936 PR may be good to go in as well now if Bosmon / Bosmon7 doesn\'t have further comments.
2016-08-22T14:47:05 <Justin_o> alanharnum: okay.. I guess I\'ll leave that one to Bosmon to merge then

2016-08-22T15:29:14 <Bosmon7> Hey, avtar, the-t-in-rtf, colinclark, etc.
2016-08-22T15:29:20 <colinclark> hiya
2016-08-22T15:29:29 <Bosmon7> The last time I checked, I was told that our CI now runs Infusion\'s browser tests
2016-08-22T15:29:38 <Bosmon7> But the-t-in-rtf now tells me that avtar tells him that it doesn\'t
2016-08-22T15:29:48 <Bosmon7> So I thought I\'d get us all together to get a clear story on this
2016-08-22T15:30:20 <avtar> Bosmon7: fluid\'s ci server doesn\'t run browser tests
2016-08-22T15:30:33 <Bosmon7> ok
2016-08-22T15:30:53 <avtar> https://github.com/fluid-project/ci-service/pull/3
2016-08-22T15:32:21 <Bosmon7> avtar - does it work?
2016-08-22T15:32:59 <avtar> Bosmon7: one sec, at stand up
2016-08-22T15:38:08 <the-t-in-rtf> @Bosmon7 @avtar, I was talking about getting TAP output from jqUnit running in node.
2016-08-22T15:38:29 <the-t-in-rtf> I already have an approach to getting TAP from QUnit and jqUnit in the browser.
2016-08-22T15:39:03 <Bosmon7> It seems bizarre that the two would be very different
2016-08-22T15:39:08 <the-t-in-rtf> @avtar and I discussed a few approaches, including qunit-tap, which doesn\'t work with our forked version of QUnit (again, on the node side).
2016-08-22T15:40:47 * sepidehshahi has quit
2016-08-22T15:41:53 <the-t-in-rtf> It\'s a good point about Testem, will have to revisit their approach to extracting QUnit output again.
2016-08-22T15:42:15 <the-t-in-rtf> I did verify that you can simply add a listener to log events in QUnit, which I believe is what they did also?
2016-08-22T15:42:23 <the-t-in-rtf> on the browser side, that works fine.

2016-08-22T15:55:37 <Justin_o> we were hoping to get that in for Infusion 2.0, does that still make sense?
