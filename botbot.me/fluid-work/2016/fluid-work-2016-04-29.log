2016-04-29T13:27:05 <PaliwalSparsh> @cindyli Hi
2016-04-29T13:27:14 <cindyli> hi, PaliwalSparsh
2016-04-29T13:27:38 <cindyli> great that you contact us. how is it going?
2016-04-29T13:28:18 <PaliwalSparsh> @cindyli It is going good right now I am having my exams after 7th I will get in full force with the project
2016-04-29T13:28:38 <PaliwalSparsh> I always wondered is everyone here from OCAD University
2016-04-29T13:28:45 <cindyli> thanks for letting us know, PaliwalSparsh
2016-04-29T13:30:22 <cindyli> not really, PaliwalSparsh. some are from OCADU, some are from other parts in the world :) but we work together on this or that project :)
2016-04-29T13:30:54 <cindyli> did you contact your mentor, PaliwalSparsh?
2016-04-29T13:32:38 <PaliwalSparsh> @cindyli Yes I contacted danayo told her about everything on the very first working day after result. I had todays day free I have a next exam 2 days from now so thought should come on IRC.
2016-04-29T13:32:56 <cindyli> that's great. thanks, PaliwalSparsh
2016-04-29T13:33:12 <PaliwalSparsh> Are you from OCAD
2016-04-29T13:33:16 <cindyli> yes
2016-04-29T13:33:24 <PaliwalSparsh> Great :)
2016-04-29T13:33:38 <PaliwalSparsh> You must be doing your masters
2016-04-29T13:33:52 <PaliwalSparsh> I saw this inclusive as a MDes subject
2016-04-29T13:34:07 <PaliwalSparsh> **inclusive design
2016-04-29T13:34:41 <cindyli> nah, i work as a software developer. yes, our research centre does have a master program on inclusive design

2016-04-29T13:37:03 <PaliwalSparsh> This is one great of a community I have worked before this in many opensource projects there is either one guy or two mainting the project. That's why I was curious thanks for telling this.
2016-04-29T13:38:40 <cindyli> no problem, PaliwalSparsh. one step to be involved in the community is get to know the community. ;)

2016-04-29T13:56:08 <jhernandez> clown: hey
2016-04-29T13:56:12 <jhernandez> mmm
2016-04-29T13:56:13 <jhernandez> not sure
2016-04-29T13:56:20 <clown> :-)
2016-04-29T13:56:46 <jhernandez> are you a friend of webrtc free solutions?
2016-04-29T13:56:55 <jhernandez> I think we can use appear.in
2016-04-29T13:57:05 <clown> what's wrong with webrtc?
2016-04-29T13:57:11 <clown> just curious.
2016-04-29T13:57:13 <jhernandez> nothing
2016-04-29T13:57:23 <jhernandez> (at least from my side) :P
2016-04-29T13:57:26 * clown clicks on appear.in
2016-04-29T13:57:42 <jhernandez> it's free and up to 8 people
2016-04-29T13:57:51 <clown> wow\xe2\x80\xa6
2016-04-29T13:57:56 <clown> and, it supports video.
2016-04-29T13:58:02 <clown> got a room name?
2016-04-29T13:58:04 <amatas> clown, jhernandez lets give a try: https://appear.in/gpii-linux
2016-04-29T13:58:11 <clown> thanks amatas.
2016-04-29T13:58:35 <amatas> avtar, are you around?
2016-04-29T14:01:25 <avtar> amatas: yup
2016-04-29T14:03:00 <colinclark> simonjb, michelled, Bosmon, cindyli: My Vidyo room in 5 minutes?
2016-04-29T14:03:06 <colinclark> I'm just running slightly behind this morning
2016-04-29T14:03:07 <Bosmon> colinclark - ok
2016-04-29T14:03:12 <Bosmon> me too
2016-04-29T14:03:16 <cindyli> sure
2016-04-29T14:03:19 <simonjb> sure

2016-04-29T14:03:49 * lliskovoi has quit
2016-04-29T14:05:54 <simonjb> colinclark and Bosmon: I was thinking about some convenience code that I have in nexus-demos: https://github.com/simonbates/nexus-demos/tree/master/src
2016-04-29T14:06:22 <colinclark> yes
2016-04-29T14:06:24 <simonjb> the code is more widely useful than the demos
2016-04-29T14:06:30 <colinclark> yes, it's very useful
2016-04-29T14:06:46 <simonjb> I was thinking of maybe creating a new repo nexus-client
2016-04-29T14:07:12 <simonjb> for code that is useful for software that integrates with the nexus
2016-04-29T14:07:30 <simonjb> it could also go into the nexus repo itself
2016-04-29T14:07:45 * kasparne_ joined the channel
2016-04-29T14:08:08 <simonjb> I'm thinking code like this (functions for constructing peers and making nexus connected components) will grow
2016-04-29T14:08:20 <simonjb> such as adding disconnect handling logic
2016-04-29T14:09:02 <colinclark> yes
2016-04-29T14:09:03 <simonjb> do you have any preferences regarding a separate repo vs the main nexus repo?
2016-04-29T14:09:11 <colinclark> I think it makes sense to have a separate repository for it
2016-04-29T14:09:28 <colinclark> and presumably we may end up making things like this for several languages
2016-04-29T14:09:52 <simonjb> yes, agreed on the several languages
2016-04-29T14:10:25 <simonjb> I could maybe abstract some Java code that I will use for AsTeRICS
2016-04-29T14:10:42 <simonjb> okay, that's a good argument for a separate repo
2016-04-29T14:10:43 <simonjb> thanks
