2016-03-04T20:26:43 <jhung> alanharnum: Sorry it took so long, but I\'m done looking over your sonification page. I can\'t shake the feeling that there should be a "Do you even sonify, bro?" section. Like links to tools, technology, other examples.
2016-03-04T20:27:10 <alanharnum> jhung: yeah, i think that\'s a reasonable suggestion
2016-03-04T20:27:29 <alanharnum> jhung: though I won\'t call it that ;)

2016-03-04T17:28:13 <Justin_o> bens__: i just did that too, if you haven\'t already :)
2016-03-04T17:28:13 <Justin_o> https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-1627?filter=10801
2016-03-04T17:28:36 <bens__> oh Justin_o looks like I beat you too it by 1 https://issues.gpii.net/issues/?filter=10800
2016-03-04T17:28:37 <bens__> :)
2016-03-04T17:28:56 <Justin_o> bens__: :) we\'ll go with your then
2016-03-04T17:29:31 <bens__> Justin_o, I was going to suggest the opposite in case your JIRA account is longer lasting than mine
2016-03-04T17:30:26 <Justin_o> bens__: bens__ i just deleted mine filter.. um.. let me see if i can grab yours
2016-03-04T17:32:02 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2016-03-04T17:32:57 <bens__> Justin_o, per https://confluence.atlassian.com/jira/managing-users-185729439.html - filters of a user are deleted when the user is deleted. I\'ll keep my account open but if there is an auto-purge of inactive users that would break the link
2016-03-04T17:32:58 <Justin_o> bens__: i just took over ownership of the filter you created
2016-03-04T17:33:15 <Justin_o> so it should be okay now
2016-03-04T17:33:19 <bens__> Justin_o, ok great

2016-03-04T17:36:17 <Justin_o> bens__: great.... i\'m going to be heading offline now... feel free to e-mail me if anything comes up.
2016-03-04T17:36:36 <bens__> Justin_o, will do. thanks again and have a great weekend
