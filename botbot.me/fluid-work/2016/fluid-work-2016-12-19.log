2016-12-19T15:56:54 <Bosmon> Hi there Justin_o
2016-12-19T15:57:04 <Bosmon> So I was just rolling a dev release of Infusion for the-t-in-rtf
2016-12-19T15:57:49 <Bosmon> And I wonder if I worryingly observing that it seems to have displaced our main release as the latest dist version in npm\'s eyes
2016-12-19T15:58:10 <Bosmon> $ npm view infusion dist.tarball
2016-12-19T15:58:10 <Bosmon> https://registry.npmjs.org/infusion/-/infusion-2.0.0-dev.20161219T154515Z.0f2ccc8.tgz
2016-12-19T15:58:30 <Bosmon> So I notice that we do this step as part of our fluid-publish dev workflow:
2016-12-19T15:58:32 <Bosmon> Executing Command: npm dist-tag add infusion@2.0.0-dev.20161219T154515Z.0f2ccc8 dev
2016-12-19T15:58:38 <Bosmon> Have we done the right thing here?
2016-12-19T15:59:01 <Bosmon> I guess I\'m not really clear on what npm\'s idiom is for declaring the "latest" release of something
2016-12-19T16:00:20 <the-t-in-rtf> I also have a question.  Why isn\'t that something like 2.0.1-dev.xxx
2016-12-19T16:00:23 <the-t-in-rtf> ?
2016-12-19T16:00:59 <Bosmon> Well, that\'s also a very good question
2016-12-19T16:01:01 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: yes, it should have been updated to something like 3.0.0-dev.xxx
2016-12-19T16:01:16 <Justin_o> but it isn\'t because we haven\'t updated the version number in infusion yet
2016-12-19T16:01:20 <Bosmon> I guess following the release there should have been a bump in version number
2016-12-19T16:01:21 <Justin_o> we should probably do that ASAP
2016-12-19T16:01:26 <Bosmon> But this raises a huge question to me
2016-12-19T16:01:28 <Justin_o> Bosmon: exactly
2016-12-19T16:01:35 <Bosmon> How do we know waht the next release of Infusion is actually going to be?
2016-12-19T16:01:45 <Bosmon> Will it be 2.0.1, 2.1.0 or 3.0.0?
2016-12-19T16:01:59 <Justin_o> Bosmon: it is strange that it is showing up as the latest release though, i thought it would have shown 2.0.0 still
2016-12-19T16:02:11 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yah, that\'s always the question i guess
2016-12-19T16:02:18 <Justin_o> and i\'m not sure the answer
2016-12-19T16:02:40 <Justin_o> before it was easier because we were mostly doing point releases, but now we\'re probably going to be release major releases more often
2016-12-19T16:02:45 <Bosmon> My random guess, based on what might go in to it on current projections, is that it should be 2.1.0
2016-12-19T16:03:17 <the-t-in-rtf> yes, my point is that it seems odd for pre-2.0.0 dev releases and post-2.0.0 dev releases to share the same leader.
2016-12-19T16:03:24 <Justin_o> Bosmon: but if we do that we\'ll have to make sure that we don\'t commit and backwards incompatible changes
2016-12-19T16:03:25 <the-t-in-rtf> leader = leading material
2016-12-19T16:03:30 <Justin_o> or at least bump the speculated version up at the time
2016-12-19T16:03:44 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: yah, that\'s a mistake
2016-12-19T16:03:54 <Justin_o> because we didn\'t bump the version number in infusion after the release was tagged
2016-12-19T16:03:55 <Bosmon> Since if we released the FLUID-5585 fix for the-t-in-rtf, I don\'t think this could count as a point fix
2016-12-19T16:04:25 <Bosmon> As you know, my opinion is that semver is bunk : P
2016-12-19T16:04:38 <Justin_o> Bosmon:  what do you mean by point there?
2016-12-19T16:04:42 <Bosmon> GIven it is impossible to match the wording of its criteria onto something which you can do in practice
2016-12-19T16:04:49 <the-t-in-rtf> I can confirm that yarn outdated at least considers the tag as newer than 2.0.0
2016-12-19T16:05:05 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I mean "my feeling" is that this change is too big to be declared 2.0.1
2016-12-19T16:05:29 <Bosmon> Given we already considered it too big to disrupt our release process by forcing us to restart our testing
2016-12-19T16:05:33 <Bosmon> But in practice all it does is fix a bug
2016-12-19T16:06:20 <Bosmon> Ok
2016-12-19T16:06:42 <Bosmon> THis suggests to me that we should take this golden opportunity to fix our policy on naming dev releases
2016-12-19T16:06:53 <Bosmon> And to name them after the PREVIOUS release :)
2016-12-19T16:07:02 <Bosmon> This at least leaves us with nothing to do with respect to our current problem
2016-12-19T16:07:12 <Bosmon> Of "trying to guess what the next release will be called"
2016-12-19T16:07:19 <Bosmon> And it also solves our "outdated" problem
2016-12-19T16:07:37 <Justin_o> Bosmon: regarding dist tag https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/dist-tag
2016-12-19T16:07:59 <Justin_o> Bosmon: it makes things confusing though, but i guess that\'ll clear up over time
2016-12-19T16:08:08 <Justin_o> in terms of all our other dev releases
2016-12-19T16:08:20 <Justin_o> can you send a proposal for that to the list
2016-12-19T16:08:29 <Bosmon> Justin_o - ok - so can we retrospectively apply the "latest" tag to the releases?
2016-12-19T16:08:33 <Bosmon> to the release I mean?
2016-12-19T16:08:39 <Justin_o> Bosmon: also, can you join our Infusion review session at the community meeting time this wednesday
2016-12-19T16:08:47 <Justin_o> lots of Infusion related things to discuss
2016-12-19T16:08:50 <Bosmon> oh wow
2016-12-19T16:09:11 <Bosmon> That might be a bit tough .....
2016-12-19T16:09:13 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i think it should have been done automatically, so i\'m a bit surprised that things aren\'t working
2016-12-19T16:09:18 <Bosmon> I can try
2016-12-19T16:09:22 <Bosmon> It\'s at 2.30 EST?
2016-12-19T16:09:52 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes that\'s right
2016-12-19T16:10:16 <Bosmon> Justin_o - looks like it wasn\'t: $ npm dist-tag ls infusion
2016-12-19T16:10:16 <Bosmon> dev: 2.0.0-dev.20161219T154515Z.0f2ccc8
2016-12-19T16:10:16 <Bosmon> latest: 2.0.0-dev.20161219T154515Z.0f2ccc8
2016-12-19T16:10:18 <Justin_o> Bosmon:  i sent an e-mail to the work list last week, with some things we\'ll be discussing, but we can talk about this as well
2016-12-19T16:10:44 <Justin_o> Bosmon:  here are the dist-tag docs https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/dist-tag
2016-12-19T16:10:54 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I got this command from them :)
2016-12-19T16:11:27 <Bosmon> Ok
2016-12-19T16:11:28 <Justin_o> Bosmon:  "Publishing a package sets the latest tag to the published version unless the --tag option is used. For example, npm publish --tag=beta."
2016-12-19T16:11:32 <Bosmon> So looks like fluid-publish is faulty
2016-12-19T16:11:40 <Bosmon> We have a great opportunity to make another fix during this review :)

2016-12-19T16:13:26 <Bosmon> Justin_o - just the line you quoted there
2016-12-19T16:13:30 <Bosmon> We don\'t do what they say
2016-12-19T16:13:46 <Bosmon> Thankfully since we now echo commands to the console this is easy to see :)
2016-12-19T16:14:01 <Bosmon> This is my recent log from fluid-publish:
2016-12-19T16:14:02 <Bosmon> Executing Command: npm publish
2016-12-19T16:14:02 <Bosmon> Executing Command: npm dist-tag add infusion@2.0.0-dev.20161219T154515Z.0f2ccc8 dev
2016-12-19T16:14:14 <Bosmon> So the first command will pollute the "latest" tag
2016-12-19T16:14:24 <Justin_o> Bosmon: we\'re missing the "--tag" part of the command?
2016-12-19T16:14:26 <Bosmon> And the 2nd one adds the "dev" tag on top of the existing one, after the fact
2016-12-19T16:14:29 <Bosmon> Justin_o - right
2016-12-19T16:14:36 <Justin_o> :(
2016-12-19T16:15:02 <Justin_o> well at least the bug in the fluid-publish is easy to fix
2016-12-19T16:15:06 <Justin_o> not sure about the cleanup in npm though
2016-12-19T16:15:15 <Bosmon> I\'m sure we can just move the tag now
2016-12-19T16:15:30 <Bosmon> Justin_o - not to worry, this is what the review cycle is for : P
2016-12-19T16:15:36 <Justin_o> Bosmon: you mean move it back to the actual release
2016-12-19T16:15:38 <Bosmon> I guess this is the first time we have cut a release of a major project
2016-12-19T16:15:40 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes
2016-12-19T16:15:48 <Bosmon> And some things can only really be tested by doing them :)
2016-12-19T16:15:50 <Justin_o> Bosmon: true thanks for catching it
2016-12-19T16:16:20 <Bosmon> Ever since Kettle moved to proper releases I never cut a further dev release of it
2016-12-19T16:16:31 <Bosmon> So we never got to observe the effect of running fluid-publish after a proper releases
2016-12-19T16:16:32 <Bosmon> release
2016-12-19T16:17:13 <Justin_o> Bosmon: would you like me to fix this in my current PR for fluid-publish
2016-12-19T16:17:45 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes please
2016-12-19T16:17:49 <Justin_o> i see you already left a comment there :)
2016-12-19T16:17:50 <Bosmon> I\'ve added a review comment to that effect
2016-12-19T16:18:00 <Bosmon> Ok, and it looks like I\'ve successfully managed to move the tag
2016-12-19T16:18:11 <Bosmon> $ npm dist-tag ls infusion
2016-12-19T16:18:11 <Bosmon> dev: 2.0.0-dev.20161219T154515Z.0f2ccc8
2016-12-19T16:18:11 <Bosmon> latest: 2.0.0
2016-12-19T16:19:06 <Bosmon> And the front page on npm now agrees: https://www.npmjs.com/package/infusion
2016-12-19T16:19:27 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks for fixing that.. in terms of this fix, now i\'m confused again
2016-12-19T16:19:44 <Justin_o> Bosmon: this is the add command "npm dist-tag add <pkg>@<version> [<tag>]"
2016-12-19T16:19:59 <Justin_o> it doesn\'t use the --tag portion, that was in the npm install
2016-12-19T16:20:20 <Justin_o> although the description is further confusion "add: Tags the specified version of the package with the specified tag, or the --tag config if not specified."
2016-12-19T16:20:27 <Bosmon> Justin_o - do you mean "in the npm publish"?
2016-12-19T16:20:31 <Bosmon> And it wasn\'t
2016-12-19T16:20:40 <Justin_o> i mean in the dist-tag doc
2016-12-19T16:20:46 <Bosmon> Yes
2016-12-19T16:20:54 <Bosmon> You said "[16:20] <Justin_o> it doesn\'t use the --tag portion, that was in the npm install"
2016-12-19T16:20:59 <Bosmon> I think you meant "in the npm publish"?
2016-12-19T16:21:28 <Justin_o> Bosmon: ah i see, now.. so the dist-tag command is correct, but because we already published it set it to latest
2016-12-19T16:21:34 <Bosmon> Justin_o - right
2016-12-19T16:21:35 <Justin_o> so we actually need to move the tagging to the publish step
2016-12-19T16:21:37 <Justin_o> got it
2016-12-19T16:21:43 <Bosmon> It is in that line of the docs you pasted about 10 minutes back

2016-12-19T17:34:02 <the-t-in-rtf> @simonjb, it\'s a good list, I\'d be happy if you just covered battery charging and I/O\xe2\x80\xa6 ;)
2016-12-19T17:34:18 <the-t-in-rtf> the rest is just sweet gravy.
2016-12-19T17:34:30 <the-t-in-rtf> Do the Irish also make gravy with Whiskey?
2016-12-19T17:34:36 <the-t-in-rtf> (the Scots do)
2016-12-19T17:35:12 <simonjb> the-t-in-rtf: I don\'t think I\'ve ever had any but I think there\'s a high probability that it exists :)
2016-12-19T17:36:20 <the-t-in-rtf> need to find a more canonical source, but the two recipes I googled make it sound like a pan gravy where you use the whiskey to deglaze the pan and then add cream
2016-12-19T17:36:33 <the-t-in-rtf> sounds nicer than the Scots version, which starts with a white sauce.
2016-12-19T17:36:44 <the-t-in-rtf> Then again, that\'s for Haggis, which produces no pan gravy.
