b'2016-06-17T22:41:17 <Bosmon> We don\'t have a clear way to control them from outside the system, but we have them
2016-06-17T22:41:25 <gloob> ok
2016-06-17T22:41:31 <gloob> the system its in place
2016-06-17T22:41:47 <Bosmon> http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/CoreAPI.html#fluid-setlogging-loglevel-
2016-06-17T22:41:49 <colinclark> meaning, in this particular case, we don\'t have the ability to easily toggle verbose logging on
2016-06-17T22:41:51 <Bosmon> Here is the API
2016-06-17T22:42:08 <Bosmon> I imagine we need a general, declarative way to encode this, via the command line or env
2016-06-17T22:42:11 <colinclark> like node tests\\UnitTests.js --fluid.logLevel=HOLY_A_LOT
2016-06-17T22:42:20 <gloob> env better or just parameters
2016-06-17T22:42:28 <gloob> i prefer env
2016-06-17T22:42:32 <gloob> or both
2016-06-17T22:42:38 <gloob> env is going to be useful for the ops guys
2016-06-17T22:42:46 <colinclark> yeah
2016-06-17T22:42:52 <gloob> but also they are more HIDDEN
2016-06-17T22:42:54 <gloob> ahhhhh
2016-06-17T22:43:03 <Bosmon> ok
2016-06-17T22:43:08 <colinclark> ok, i hate to hit the road before you guys
2016-06-17T22:43:10 <colinclark> since it\'s so late there
2016-06-17T22:43:13 <gloob> there?
2016-06-17T22:43:14 <gloob> xD
2016-06-17T22:43:19 <Bosmon> So remind me of the phenomenology of this "2nd time" thing?
2016-06-17T22:43:19 <colinclark> but darcie\'s going to kill me if i don\'t get home
2016-06-17T22:43:25 <gloob> and you are talkng with a british and a spanish
2016-06-17T22:43:26 <Bosmon> Who has seen it, under what conditions?
2016-06-17T22:43:31 <colinclark> I have seen it
2016-06-17T22:43:33 <colinclark> consistently
2016-06-17T22:43:34 <colinclark> in Vagrant
2016-06-17T22:43:44 <colinclark> Provision a fresh box with "vagrant up"
2016-06-17T22:43:52 <colinclark> run the UNIT TESTS first
2016-06-17T22:43:54 <colinclark> they\'ll fail
2016-06-17T22:44:05 <gloob> colinclark: theoritically I should be dead by now
2016-06-17T22:44:06 <colinclark> run \'em again, they\'ll consistently pass
2016-06-17T22:44:15 <colinclark> you\'ll see gloob\'s theories in the log, a few minutes ago
2016-06-17T22:44:21 <Bosmon> And it is the high contrast that will fail?
2016-06-17T22:44:25 <gloob> yes
2016-06-17T22:44:26 <gloob> first
2016-06-17T22:44:27 <colinclark> yep
2016-06-17T22:44:27 <gloob> not seconf
2016-06-17T22:44:28 <Bosmon> ok
2016-06-17T22:44:32 <colinclark> gloob: DON\'T DIE!
2016-06-17T22:44:32 <gloob> fix incoming
2016-06-17T22:44:36 <Bosmon> I think gloob\'s theories sound reasonable
2016-06-17T22:44:44 <gloob> colinclark: not by myself, my wife...
2016-06-17T22:44:48 <Bosmon> In theory we can destroy both these issues before midnight GMT :)
2016-06-17T22:44:53 <gloob> so it sounds pretty familiar to me, your case
2016-06-17T22:44:54 <colinclark> ha!
2016-06-17T22:44:56 <gloob> xDDD
2016-06-17T22:45:04 <colinclark> gloob: :)
2016-06-17T22:45:08 <Bosmon> For me, my girlfriend is asleep already :)
2016-06-17T22:45:24 <colinclark> fianc\xc3\xa9, no less!
2016-06-17T22:45:27 <colinclark> that\'s the best time to code
2016-06-17T22:45:28 <Bosmon> I\'ll issue a pull fixing the registryResolver tests now
2016-06-17T22:45:30 <colinclark> when the partner is asleep
2016-06-17T22:45:39 <colinclark> thanks, Bosmon
2016-06-17T22:45:44 <colinclark> I can merge it tomorrow if I get some time
2016-06-17T22:45:45 <Bosmon> colinclark - and what did you see on my 1848 branch?
2016-06-17T22:45:49 <colinclark> well
2016-06-17T22:45:55 <colinclark> the screenshots should be pretty clear
2016-06-17T22:46:06 <Bosmon> I could never see any of them
2016-06-17T22:46:10 <colinclark> it actually legitimately can\'t find the actual legitimate node-jqunit
2016-06-17T22:46:15 <colinclark> oh really?
2016-06-17T22:46:21 <colinclark> on the Github pull request?
2016-06-17T22:46:33 <Bosmon> Oh sorry
2016-06-17T22:46:45 <Bosmon> I haven\'t checked my mail since sitting down : P
2016-06-17T22:46:47 <Bosmon> No worries
2016-06-17T22:46:57 <colinclark> I would have pasted the actual output, but I don\'t think there\'s clipboard support in VBox
2016-06-17T22:47:03 <colinclark> without some extra guest additions
2016-06-17T22:47:05 <colinclark> so I used screenshots
2016-06-17T22:47:39 <colinclark> I can make you a pull request if you want with the removal of the junk in build.bat
2016-06-17T22:48:16 <colinclark> I am going to merge minogian\'s stuff now, just so it\'s not hanging in my personal clone
2016-06-17T22:48:22 <Bosmon> ok
2016-06-17T22:48:33 <Bosmon> Didn\'t I destroy all those .bat files in my pull?
2016-06-17T22:48:39 <colinclark> not that particular one
2016-06-17T22:48:42 <Bosmon> They seemed to be bound to incredibly obsolete stuff
2016-06-17T22:48:43 <colinclark> that one is run by the provisioner
2016-06-17T22:48:45 <Bosmon> Ah
2016-06-17T22:48:50 <colinclark> it is new
2016-06-17T22:48:56 <colinclark> but duplicated some of the grunt-gpii functionality
2016-06-17T22:49:02 <colinclark> for reasons I once mentioned to you
2016-06-17T22:49:07 <colinclark> related to symlinks in windows
2016-06-17T22:49:11 <Bosmon> I see build.cmd
2016-06-17T22:49:13 <Bosmon> YOu mean that one?
2016-06-17T22:49:29 <colinclark> no
2016-06-17T22:49:30 <colinclark> https://github.com/GPII/windows/blob/master/provisioning/build.bat
2016-06-17T22:49:32 <Bosmon> Ah ok
2016-06-17T22:49:35 <colinclark> That file still exists
2016-06-17T22:49:38 <colinclark> and powers the windows build
2016-06-17T22:49:42 <Bosmon> I always assumed that .bat files only ran in DOS :)
2016-06-17T22:49:44 <colinclark> :)
2016-06-17T22:49:53 <colinclark> what\'s DOS? :P
2016-06-17T22:50:00 <colinclark> Don\'t I use DOS all the time?
2016-06-17T22:50:06 <Bosmon> I don\'t know
2016-06-17T22:50:09 <colinclark> whenever I open that horrible terminal window in Windows 10?
2016-06-17T22:50:11 <Bosmon> Don\'t you have 17 bits of a bus? : P
2016-06-17T22:50:32 <colinclark> I have a bus?!
2016-06-17T22:50:35 <colinclark> anyway, you can blast lines 4-8 of that file
2016-06-17T22:51:17 <Bosmon> Yes, ok
2016-06-17T22:52:54 <gloob> umhhhh, the question is the unicode vs key codes thing
2016-06-17T22:52:58 <gloob> and POINTERS
2016-06-17T22:53:21 <gloob> unicode in windows is uint16 and key map are uchar
2016-06-17T22:53:36 <gloob> this should be fixed with all the other changes
2016-06-17T22:55:13 <gloob> I think is better to have a consistent system to manage the string pointers in the structs than a dirty fix now to achieve the 00:00 GMT deadline
2016-06-17T22:55:16 <gloob> :)
2016-06-17T22:55:34 <gloob> I will check in Monday probably
2016-06-17T22:55:47 <gloob> but the problems is that one, there\'s the two actions together
2016-06-17T22:55:51 <gloob> the get and the set
2016-06-17T22:56:05 <gloob> https://github.com/GPII/windows/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/spiSettingsHandler/test/testHighContrast.json#L3 GET
2016-06-17T22:56:11 <gloob> https://github.com/GPII/windows/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/spiSettingsHandler/test/testHighContrast.json#L4 SET
2016-06-17T22:56:26 <colinclark> seems reasonable, gloob
2016-06-17T22:56:34 <Bosmon> gloob - these don\'t work in a consistent way?
2016-06-17T22:56:44 <gloob> no
2016-06-17T22:56:53 <gloob> the get is getting blank
2016-06-17T22:57:01 <gloob> and the set, instead of using the value
2016-06-17T22:57:15 <gloob> or maybe although using it, its not working and setting as blank
2016-06-17T22:57:35 <Bosmon> blank === the empty string?
2016-06-17T22:57:40 <gloob> yes
2016-06-17T22:57:45 <Bosmon> ok well
2016-06-17T22:57:45 <gloob> null
2016-06-17T22:57:52 <Bosmon> null !== the empty string
2016-06-17T22:57:59 <gloob> probably is null
2016-06-17T22:58:00 <Bosmon> Anyway, we have a plausible mechanism of action for this bug
2016-06-17T22:58:10 <Bosmon> It is only a "matter of time" before we track it down :)
2016-06-17T22:58:17 <gloob> yeps
2016-06-17T22:58:27 <gloob> so, gentlemen
2016-06-17T22:58:30 <gloob> good night
2016-06-17T22:58:38 * gloob hides
2016-06-17T22:58:55 <colinclark> g\'night gloob
2016-06-17T22:59:00 <colinclark> thanks for your help
2016-06-17T22:59:33 <colinclark> Bosmon: I\'m going to hit the road now too
2016-06-17T22:59:51 <colinclark> see you sometime this weekend, for sure
2016-06-17T23:00:27 * wannabeCitizen has quit
2016-06-17T23:34:17 * wannabeCitizen joined the channel
2016-06-17T23:38:37 * colinclark joined the channel
2016-06-17T23:47:14 * colinclark has quit
'

b'2016-06-17T22:23:05 <gloob> killing 64bits
2016-06-17T22:23:07 <gloob> apps
2016-06-17T22:23:10 <gloob> anyway
2016-06-17T22:23:14 <gloob> back to high contrast
2016-06-17T22:23:24 <gloob> one of the problems we are having with the implementation of windows
2016-06-17T22:23:37 <gloob> its some weird way to use array of strings as pointers
2016-06-17T22:23:43 <colinclark> right
2016-06-17T22:23:51 <gloob> this fails in 32, 64 and 3 trillions of bits
2016-06-17T22:23:55 <colinclark> hahaha
2016-06-17T22:24:03 <gloob> so
2016-06-17T22:24:09 <gloob> what\'s happening here
2016-06-17T22:24:09 <gloob> is
2016-06-17T22:24:14 <gloob> in the first run
2016-06-17T22:24:26 <gloob> the expected is blank string
2016-06-17T22:24:30 <colinclark> yes
2016-06-17T22:24:38 <gloob> for whatever reason it set to blank
2016-06-17T22:24:56 <gloob> (whatever reason is that the pointer is pointing to other place)
2016-06-17T22:25:01 <colinclark> right
2016-06-17T22:25:03 <gloob> so next run
2016-06-17T22:25:05 <gloob> match
2016-06-17T22:25:10 <gloob> blank with blank
2016-06-17T22:25:17 <gloob> THAT IS ALL THE TRICK
2016-06-17T22:25:18 <colinclark> seems plausible
2016-06-17T22:25:29 <colinclark> ok
2016-06-17T22:25:29 <gtirloni> is it possible to run a test and ignore the result?
2016-06-17T22:25:50 <gloob> well, you need some expected to compare the assertion
2016-06-17T22:25:56 <gloob> to ASSERT actually
2016-06-17T22:26:04 <gtirloni> can we run without the assert?
2016-06-17T22:26:06 <gtirloni> it\'d be better to run this test once, ignore it, and run it again right after
2016-06-17T22:26:17 <gloob> I think better is jsut fixing it
2016-06-17T22:26:22 <gloob> but from my point of view
2016-06-17T22:26:23 <colinclark> me too :)
2016-06-17T22:26:24 <gloob> is not important
2016-06-17T22:26:30 <gloob> we can delay it and assign to me
2016-06-17T22:26:32 <gloob> is under control
2016-06-17T22:26:56 <colinclark> Bosmon: Just to confirm, we definitely have a test running, erroring, and not being reported as a failure
2016-06-17T22:26:57 <gloob> I think that CI clarification, jqunit are more important
2016-06-17T22:27:08 <gloob> Bosmon: the jqunit ones?
2016-06-17T22:27:12 <gloob> sorry, colinclark ?
2016-06-17T22:27:14 <colinclark> yes
2016-06-17T22:27:15 <colinclark> that one
2016-06-17T22:27:18 <gloob> huhuhu
2016-06-17T22:27:20 <gloob> pretty solid
2016-06-17T22:27:21 <gloob> xD
2016-06-17T22:27:28 <Bosmon> Ok
2016-06-17T22:27:34 <Bosmon> So I just did a fresh, clean checkout
2016-06-17T22:27:39 <colinclark> I\'m going to file an issue about it
2016-06-17T22:27:40 <Bosmon> And I got 42/42 UnitTests.js pass
2016-06-17T22:27:45 <colinclark> lucky you :)
2016-06-17T22:27:50 <colinclark> I get that the second time, yes
2016-06-17T22:27:56 <colinclark> and you\'ll see the error above
2016-06-17T22:27:58 <Bosmon> However I *DO* get the fatal jqUnit error
2016-06-17T22:28:02 <colinclark> but it doesn\'t count as a failure
2016-06-17T22:28:05 <colinclark> yep, great!
2016-06-17T22:28:06 <gloob> https://github.com/GPII/windows/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/spiSettingsHandler/test/testHighContrast.json#L12
2016-06-17T22:28:17 <gloob> this needs to be changed to an array
2016-06-17T22:28:21 <gloob> and it will be fixed
2016-06-17T22:28:26 <gloob> FUCK Im going to fix it
2016-06-17T22:28:39 <colinclark> gloob: DO IT, SEVILLA!
2016-06-17T22:28:49 <Bosmon> Yes, this is quite tough
2016-06-17T22:29:14 <gloob> by the way
2016-06-17T22:29:16 <Bosmon> Given that the error occurs before jqUnit has loaded in the opinion of the tests, it\'s hard to get it reported
2016-06-17T22:29:17 <gloob> colinclark: unrelated
2016-06-17T22:29:39 <Bosmon> It\'s part of the penalty we pay for not having node-jqUnit simply being a part of Infusion, which it really should be
2016-06-17T22:29:42 <gloob> colinclark: are you taking into consideration in the security work the implications of implicit code in the payloads?
2016-06-17T22:29:47 <gloob> it;s pretty dangerous
2016-06-17T22:29:52 <gloob> we are creating some kind of operative system here
2016-06-17T22:30:01 <colinclark> implicit code in the payloads?
2016-06-17T22:30:02 <Bosmon> gloob - shush :)
2016-06-17T22:30:20 <gloob> https://github.com/GPII/windows/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/spiSettingsHandler/test/testHighContrast.json#L12
2016-06-17T22:30:24 <Bosmon> Of course we are taking it into consideration.... it\'s been one of the key issues in the design of the whole system
2016-06-17T22:30:29 <gloob> actions, params, etc...
2016-06-17T22:30:39 <gloob> Bosmon: great
2016-06-17T22:30:48 <gloob> just to share my concerns
2016-06-17T22:31:01 <gloob> I, absolutely, wasn\'t doubt it about!
2016-06-17T22:31:04 <Bosmon> gloob - it\'s why these payloads consist of JSON rather than arbitrary JS code
2016-06-17T22:31:17 <Bosmon> It means that an automated security audit is at least possible
2016-06-17T22:31:38 <gloob> fantastic
2016-06-17T22:31:39 <Bosmon> But it would be impossible not to have this information encoded somehow, given the system has to be capable of an ESSENTIALLY ARBITRARY ACTION on the user\'s system!
2016-06-17T22:31:49 <Bosmon> I mean, think about it.... the system has to be capable of doing ABSOLUTELY ANYTHING
2016-06-17T22:31:51 <gloob> yes, it\'s neat
2016-06-17T22:31:54 <Bosmon> And yet it has to be somehow securable
2016-06-17T22:32:00 <gloob> but dangerous
2016-06-17T22:32:02 <gloob> great great
2016-06-17T22:32:08 <gloob> in one week I understand all this
2016-06-17T22:32:11 <gloob> thing
2016-06-17T22:32:16 <gloob> hehehe
2016-06-17T22:32:20 <Bosmon> An ordinary system would have integrators write "plugins" in native code
2016-06-17T22:32:37 <Bosmon> Which would then all have to be individually reviewed, signed and certified before they could be incorporated into the system
2016-06-17T22:32:48 <gloob> yes, makes more sense using a meta language
2016-06-17T22:32:51 <gloob> defined by us
2016-06-17T22:32:55 <Bosmon> Whereas in our system we are absolutely clear where all the risks are
2016-06-17T22:32:56 <gloob> and under control for automatic review, etc...
2016-06-17T22:33:01 <Bosmon> They lie in the settings handlers
2016-06-17T22:33:13 <Bosmon> Which we only communicate to using defined JSON payloads which can then be checked against a schema
2016-06-17T22:33:31 <Bosmon> Which, like lemon-soaked paper napkins will one day arise
2016-06-17T22:33:49 <gloob> aleluja
2016-06-17T22:34:00 <gloob> good good good
2016-06-17T22:34:16 <colinclark> this was one of the early things we debated with Gregg in particular
2016-06-17T22:34:26 <colinclark> who originally had a vision of vendors writing plugins for the GPII
2016-06-17T22:34:42 <colinclark> and we knew, knowing the market, that they\'d end up claiming this code was proprietary
2016-06-17T22:35:08 <colinclark> and the risk would be that people would come along, as "AT developers" (quotes intentional) and have uncontrollable access to the GPII
2016-06-17T22:35:23 <colinclark> no one could vet what their launchers and settings handlers would do
2016-06-17T22:35:33 <gloob> seems doable, meaning, they have a meta language to integrate if they need something extra need to extend gpii
2016-06-17T22:35:41 <colinclark> yes, perhaps eventually
2016-06-17T22:35:58 <colinclark> in the meantime, hopefully we can produce enough basic "actions" that can be vetted and reviewed
2016-06-17T22:36:03 <gloob> potentially if you extend gpii you are going to push it upstream
2016-06-17T22:36:28 <colinclark> yes
2016-06-17T22:36:31 <colinclark> exactly
2016-06-17T22:36:33 <colinclark> and then, in the solutions registry, ultimately an AT developer can only declare the sequence of actions, rather than writing "essentially arbitrary actions"
2016-06-17T22:36:46 <gloob> thanks for the explanation MATES
2016-06-17T22:37:04 <colinclark> Bosmon is sorry for shushing you :P
2016-06-17T22:37:12 <colinclark> he shushes me all the time
2016-06-17T22:37:18 <colinclark> SHUSH, PENGUIN
2016-06-17T22:37:25 <gloob> what means shushing
2016-06-17T22:37:44 <gloob> ah
2016-06-17T22:37:45 <gloob> shhh
2016-06-17T22:37:47 <gloob> shut up
2016-06-17T22:37:56 <colinclark> it\'s softer than "shut up"
2016-06-17T22:38:01 <gloob> onomatopeyic
2016-06-17T22:38:04 <colinclark> and perhaps more british :P
2016-06-17T22:38:05 <gloob> shushhhh
2016-06-17T22:38:09 <colinclark> yes
2016-06-17T22:38:17 <gloob> onomatopoeia
2016-06-17T22:38:26 <colinclark> ok, i better hit the road
2016-06-17T22:38:33 <gloob> Bosmon: TELL LIES
2016-06-17T22:38:43 <Bosmon> !
2016-06-17T22:38:47 <Bosmon> Ok
2016-06-17T22:38:57 <Bosmon> So fixing up this test reveals that the test WILL ACTUALLY FAIL
2016-06-17T22:39:01 <Bosmon> There should be FORTY-THREE TESTS
2016-06-17T22:39:07 <colinclark> :)
2016-06-17T22:39:09 <Bosmon> But still, this sheds no light on this "2nd time" phenomenon
2016-06-17T22:39:14 <colinclark> no
2016-06-17T22:39:20 <colinclark> as gloob says, it\'s a separate issue
2016-06-17T22:39:27 <colinclark> we have many, many problems here
2016-06-17T22:39:34 <gloob> 8 or 9
2016-06-17T22:39:38 <Bosmon> But at least fixing up the include for jqUnit shows that for every other kind of failure than a failure to include jqUnit, it will cause a test failure
2016-06-17T22:39:42 <gloob> all at the same time
2016-06-17T22:39:58 <colinclark> Bosmon: I think we need to shush our logs a bit
2016-06-17T22:40:02 <colinclark> what are your thoughts?
2016-06-17T22:40:10 <Bosmon> Yes, we can get rid of all the initial verbiage to start with
2016-06-17T22:40:14 <colinclark> I ran those tests a dozen times, and never even noticed
2016-06-17T22:40:15 <Bosmon> That\'s just some very old infusion logging
2016-06-17T22:40:23 <colinclark> gloob is just more observant than me
2016-06-17T22:40:32 <Bosmon> Well, but these tests are hardly even verbose by our general standards
2016-06-17T22:40:47 <gloob> I would like to have debug levels
2016-06-17T22:40:52 <Bosmon> gloob - we have them
2016-06-17T22:40:56 <gloob> for the tests?
2016-06-17T22:41:07 <gloob> so by default just ok or fail
2016-06-17T22:41:13 <colinclark> yeah, I agree
'

b'2016-06-17T22:09:34 <gloob> oh yes
2016-06-17T22:09:38 <colinclark> ok
2016-06-17T22:09:41 <gloob> sweet
2016-06-17T22:09:44 <colinclark> so this error is occurring?
2016-06-17T22:09:48 <Bosmon> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/package.json#L26
2016-06-17T22:09:54 <gloob> so probably is stopping that tests
2016-06-17T22:09:54 <Bosmon> This is the dependency that this is trying to bind to
2016-06-17T22:09:56 <gloob> it never run
2016-06-17T22:10:08 <colinclark> but the tests are reporting as passing!
2016-06-17T22:10:14 <colinclark> at least the second time around :P
2016-06-17T22:10:14 <Bosmon> colinclark - how! where!
2016-06-17T22:10:19 <gloob> probably is not executing at all
2016-06-17T22:10:20 <colinclark> why is this machinery all junk!? :P
2016-06-17T22:10:25 <colinclark> dude
2016-06-17T22:10:30 <colinclark> Bosmon
2016-06-17T22:10:31 <colinclark> dude
2016-06-17T22:10:45 <colinclark> the tests claim to pass sometimes :P
2016-06-17T22:10:49 <Bosmon> Yes
2016-06-17T22:10:54 <colinclark> you just have to run them twice
2016-06-17T22:11:04 <colinclark> this is just all chaos
2016-06-17T22:11:04 <gloob> are you sure?
2016-06-17T22:11:12 <Bosmon> Yes well
2016-06-17T22:11:24 <colinclark> I tested this at least a dozen times yesterday
2016-06-17T22:11:29 <Bosmon> Let me start with a clean checkout of windows master in my VM and see if we can guess what is happening
2016-06-17T22:11:42 <gloob> fuuuu
2016-06-17T22:11:52 <gloob> but don\'t dig so much
2016-06-17T22:11:54 <colinclark> :)
2016-06-17T22:11:59 <gloob> because some errors are fixed in my branch
2016-06-17T22:12:10 <gloob> this is pretty chaotic
2016-06-17T22:12:13 <gloob> in one side we have
2016-06-17T22:12:18 <Bosmon> Pass the 2nd time.....
2016-06-17T22:12:27 <gloob> 1) the jqunit case
2016-06-17T22:12:34 <colinclark> Bosmon: PASS THE SECOND TIME :)
2016-06-17T22:12:36 <Bosmon> Yes
2016-06-17T22:12:39 <gloob> 2) the highcontrast
2016-06-17T22:12:57 <gloob> 3) the probably we are not running testRegistryResolver.js tests
2016-06-17T22:13:07 <colinclark> yes
2016-06-17T22:13:07 <gloob> 4) the 64 bits environment happy errors
2016-06-17T22:13:08 <Bosmon> It\'s possible we have a random race condition, but I can\'t imagine i) what it is, and ii) how it could be conditioned by run number
2016-06-17T22:13:22 <colinclark> plus 5) Bosmon\'s GPII-1848 branch doesn\'t work in vagrant
2016-06-17T22:13:35 <colinclark> and 6) Bosmon can\'t successfully run the Linux vagrant VM
2016-06-17T22:13:39 <gloob> hohoho
2016-06-17T22:13:48 <Bosmon> gloob - the test CERTAINLY attempts to run: https://github.com/GPII/windows/blob/master/tests/UnitTests.js#L19
2016-06-17T22:13:48 <gloob> and 7) CI is not returning consistent results
2016-06-17T22:13:52 <Bosmon> YOu can see it right here
2016-06-17T22:13:53 <colinclark> yes
2016-06-17T22:13:58 <colinclark> #7 is quite significant
2016-06-17T22:14:13 <colinclark> Bosmon: My gut is that it\'s not a race condition
2016-06-17T22:14:14 <Bosmon> OK, CI doesn\'t return consistent results, but colinclark has seen some?
2016-06-17T22:14:14 <gloob> Bosmon: yes, but they are FATALing at start
2016-06-17T22:14:25 <Bosmon> colinclark - in a local vagrant?
2016-06-17T22:14:30 <colinclark> Bosmon: well, i should clarify here
2016-06-17T22:14:38 <colinclark> CI seems to be failing consistently...
2016-06-17T22:14:42 <colinclark> i.e. consistently with itself
2016-06-17T22:14:44 <colinclark> HOWEVER
2016-06-17T22:14:49 <gloob> not with others
2016-06-17T22:14:51 <colinclark> with completely different errors than in my local vagrant box
2016-06-17T22:14:53 <colinclark> so
2016-06-17T22:14:58 <gloob> and mine
2016-06-17T22:15:03 <colinclark> for now, we need to get our local vagrant setup working
2016-06-17T22:15:07 <gloob> so it\'s consistent in its own world
2016-06-17T22:15:11 <gloob> its pretty crazy
2016-06-17T22:15:11 <gloob> xD
2016-06-17T22:15:17 <colinclark> I provisioned about a dozen versions of the box yesterday, Bosmon
2016-06-17T22:15:21 <colinclark> Just to prove:
2016-06-17T22:15:30 <colinclark> 1. The SPI high contrast test fails
2016-06-17T22:15:34 <colinclark> 2. It only fails the first time
2016-06-17T22:15:35 <gloob> tht\'s fixed
2016-06-17T22:15:41 <colinclark> 3. It passes every other time
2016-06-17T22:15:47 <gloob> I know why
2016-06-17T22:15:52 <colinclark> gloob: Where is it fixed? :)
2016-06-17T22:15:58 <gloob> in my mind
2016-06-17T22:16:02 <colinclark> hahaha
2016-06-17T22:16:05 <colinclark> hahahahahaha
2016-06-17T22:16:06 <gloob> the problem is
2016-06-17T22:16:12 <gloob> do you want the rationale?
2016-06-17T22:16:17 <gloob> or better the patch?
2016-06-17T22:16:21 <gloob> crap I was thinking to go bed
2016-06-17T22:16:27 <colinclark> hahaha
2016-06-17T22:16:27 <gloob> rationale, then
2016-06-17T22:16:31 <colinclark> rationale\'s fine
2016-06-17T22:16:35 <gloob> the question is
2016-06-17T22:16:36 <colinclark> it\'s friday night
2016-06-17T22:16:42 <colinclark> we\'re not going to fix everything tonight
2016-06-17T22:16:51 <Bosmon> Yes
2016-06-17T22:16:51 <gloob> well
2016-06-17T22:16:55 <gloob> WHY NOT
2016-06-17T22:16:57 <gloob> ok, not
2016-06-17T22:16:57 <Bosmon> I feel we can get to the bottom of the windows issues at least
2016-06-17T22:17:03 <gloob> highcontrast
2016-06-17T22:17:07 <gloob> the question here is
2016-06-17T22:17:07 <colinclark> my goal is just to know what\'s going on :)
2016-06-17T22:17:07 <Bosmon> Not that one
2016-06-17T22:17:09 <gloob> let me check some code
2016-06-17T22:17:14 <Bosmon> We can get to the bottom of the jqUnit issue
2016-06-17T22:17:20 <Bosmon> That will have a consistent and comprehensible cause
2016-06-17T22:17:24 <colinclark> yes
2016-06-17T22:17:24 <Bosmon> Given it lies 100% in our own code
2016-06-17T22:17:27 <colinclark> yes
2016-06-17T22:17:35 <colinclark> i\'ll just reproduce what gloob is seeing
2016-06-17T22:17:38 <colinclark> i\'m sure it\'ll be there
2016-06-17T22:17:39 <Bosmon> The code which is in windows master "should never work"
2016-06-17T22:17:44 <Bosmon> Not even on the 2nd run :)
2016-06-17T22:17:49 <colinclark> yes
2016-06-17T22:17:53 <colinclark> so I assume what I\'ll see is this:
2016-06-17T22:17:57 <colinclark> 1. The error will appear
2016-06-17T22:18:01 <colinclark> 2. It won\'t cause a test failure
2016-06-17T22:18:22 <colinclark> that\'s what you see, right gloob?
2016-06-17T22:18:28 <Bosmon> !!!!!
2016-06-17T22:18:47 <colinclark> I mean, our tests output SO MUCH STUFF
2016-06-17T22:19:02 <colinclark> ok, 41/42 tests pass
2016-06-17T22:19:06 <colinclark> just like I always see the first time
2016-06-17T22:19:23 <Bosmon> And which one has failed?
2016-06-17T22:19:32 <colinclark> my friend
2016-06-17T22:19:49 <colinclark> "SpiSettingsHandler test - testHighContrast"
2016-06-17T22:20:02 <Bosmon> But you haven\'t seen the jqUnit failure?
2016-06-17T22:20:07 <colinclark> I don\'t know yet
2016-06-17T22:20:11 <colinclark> I\'m using a windows terminal :)
2016-06-17T22:20:14 <colinclark> and there\'s a ton of logs in it
2016-06-17T22:20:19 <gloob> so
2016-06-17T22:20:22 <gloob> colinclark: Bosmon
2016-06-17T22:20:26 <gloob> looks carefully this https://apps.litio.org/highcontrast_lies.png
2016-06-17T22:20:27 <gtirloni> Bosmon, are you running `vagrant up` from within cygwin?
2016-06-17T22:20:30 <colinclark> yes, ok, so I can confirm
2016-06-17T22:20:38 <colinclark> gloob is right
2016-06-17T22:20:41 <colinclark> so am I, now
2016-06-17T22:20:42 <Bosmon> gtirloni - usually, yes
2016-06-17T22:21:01 <Bosmon> Ok
2016-06-17T22:21:03 <Bosmon> Everything is hosed
2016-06-17T22:21:05 <colinclark> how does one clear a windows terminal?
2016-06-17T22:21:06 <Bosmon> I can\'t start any of my VMs
2016-06-17T22:21:14 <Bosmon> What in heck is going on
2016-06-17T22:21:19 <colinclark> we are cursed
2016-06-17T22:21:23 <gtirloni> Bosmon, my sugestion is to run it outside then. we\'re not using rsync. vagrant may be thinking it\'s in a broken posix environment and fallbacks to rsync (because it may think vbox shared folder is not working, SMB is not available, etc)
2016-06-17T22:21:25 <colinclark> cls!
2016-06-17T22:21:34 <Bosmon> gtirloni - ok, interesting point
2016-06-17T22:21:39 <Bosmon> colinclark - yes, just like in SUPERMAN II :)
2016-06-17T22:22:08 <gloob> colinclark: looks at it
2016-06-17T22:22:11 <gloob> carefully
2016-06-17T22:22:16 <colinclark> yes
2016-06-17T22:22:17 <colinclark> I see
2016-06-17T22:22:22 <gloob> what you see
2016-06-17T22:22:23 <colinclark> the test errors
2016-06-17T22:22:32 <colinclark> but it doesn\'t count as a failure
2016-06-17T22:22:36 <colinclark> by the way, to add to the fucking chaos
2016-06-17T22:22:38 <colinclark> sorry to swear
2016-06-17T22:22:42 <colinclark> sgithens is right
2016-06-17T22:22:51 <colinclark> it looks like we can\'t kill the magnifier anymore :(
2016-06-17T22:23:00 <gloob> that\'s 8th problem
2016-06-17T22:23:05 <colinclark> indeed

2016-06-17T21:38:32 <gloob> ah
2016-06-17T21:38:40 <gloob> yes
2016-06-17T21:38:42 <gloob> outside
2016-06-17T21:38:50 <gloob> release page of github?
2016-06-17T21:39:04 <gloob> like https://github.com/GPII/windows/releases
2016-06-17T21:39:13 <gloob> or maybe developer space?
2016-06-17T21:39:16 <gloob> gpii space?
2016-06-17T21:39:21 <gloob> it is a good question
2016-06-17T21:39:49 <avtar> Bosmon, colinclark: i tried https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/74 but i can\'t get the unit tests to run http://pastie.org/pastes/10881486/text because node-jqunit isn\'t available
2016-06-17T21:39:57 <colinclark> yeah
2016-06-17T21:40:00 <colinclark> I commented on the issue
2016-06-17T21:40:03 <colinclark> with hot screenshots
2016-06-17T21:40:19 <avtar> ah
2016-06-17T21:40:21 <colinclark> https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/74#issuecomment-226878521
2016-06-17T21:40:22 <avtar> so you did
2016-06-17T21:40:32 <colinclark> I can\'t get this installer to actually work
2016-06-17T21:40:37 <colinclark> it seems it did create an installer
2016-06-17T21:40:38 <gloob> screenshots are so 90s
2016-06-17T21:40:47 <colinclark> I\'m a 90s guy these days
2016-06-17T21:41:10 <avtar> colinclark performs the running man all the way to the office
2016-06-17T21:41:30 <avtar> it\'s quite something
2016-06-17T21:41:31 <gloob> is it induced by the dedupe deletion?
2016-06-17T21:44:59 <colinclark> it shoudn\'t be an issue
2016-06-17T21:45:01 <colinclark> deduping
2016-06-17T21:45:04 <colinclark> but something is up there
2016-06-17T21:45:11 <colinclark> I really have to stop reviewing our Windows code
2016-06-17T21:45:19 <colinclark> this stuff is just completely confusing :)
2016-06-17T21:45:25 <colinclark> I\'m not sure our Listeners should have been merged
2016-06-17T21:45:32 <colinclark> there are a lot of inconsistencies
2016-06-17T21:45:43 <gloob> that\'s true
2016-06-17T21:45:47 <gloob> pretty weak
2016-06-17T21:45:49 <gloob> now
2016-06-17T21:45:51 <colinclark> but, however it happens, it does appear that an installer is automatically generated
2016-06-17T21:45:56 <colinclark> as part of the CI builds
2016-06-17T21:46:07 <colinclark> it\'s not a particularly functional installer, as far as I can tell
2016-06-17T21:47:00 <colinclark> but I guess the best I can say is that it resembles something working
2016-06-17T21:47:04 <colinclark> and presumably has always been like this
2016-06-17T21:47:42 <colinclark> gloob: I think the biggest thing now is just for us to make sure that the new installer gives users the ability to optionally not install one or more listeners
2016-06-17T21:47:53 <colinclark> and that when we do have the new installer rocking, we remove this Inno stuff
2016-06-17T21:48:01 <gloob> great
2016-06-17T21:48:04 <colinclark> in the meantime, I\'m going to merge this
2016-06-17T21:48:09 <gloob> awesome
2016-06-17T21:48:21 <colinclark> avtar: Are you reasonably confident I\'m not going to be merging virus-ridden DLLs?
2016-06-17T21:48:31 <colinclark> or is there something I should do to double-check?
2016-06-17T21:48:56 <gloob> I recommend also to revert the dedupe commit and check with ci?
2016-06-17T21:49:08 <gloob> Im having the same problem in windows/master
2016-06-17T21:49:29 <colinclark> ?!
2016-06-17T21:49:36 <colinclark> Can you elaborate, gloob?
2016-06-17T21:49:47 <colinclark> deduping Infusion hasn\'t been necessary for quite a while
2016-06-17T21:49:53 <colinclark> certainly since we merged the big branch
2016-06-17T21:50:11 <gloob> the jqunit stuff is pretty new
2016-06-17T21:50:17 <gloob> I didn\'t see it before last merge
2016-06-17T21:50:19 <gloob> no?
2016-06-17T21:50:20 <avtar> colinclark: i\'ve scanned the listeners directory with bitdefender (same av software that generated the false positive for the listener executable) and it didn\'t yell at me
2016-06-17T21:50:28 <colinclark> ok
2016-06-17T21:50:40 <gloob> let me check in my machine again
2016-06-17T21:50:44 <gloob> my laptop is pretty slow
2016-06-17T21:50:56 <gloob> dear apple, please release the new mbp
2016-06-17T21:51:01 <colinclark> so is my brain
2016-06-17T21:51:59 <avtar> colinclark, gloob: i need to head to the suburbs soon but i\'ll be online later, sending emails
2016-06-17T21:52:08 <gloob> When I run try to run the unit or acceptance tests, I get an error saying jqUnit can\'t be found. If I manually add node-jqunit to the windows repo\'s devDependencies, I receive an error complaining about multiple infusions and advising me to dedupe.
2016-06-17T21:52:17 <gloob> colinclark: you said that
2016-06-17T21:52:17 <colinclark> yes
2016-06-17T21:52:33 <colinclark> that\'s the error I get when I use Bosmon\'s branch
2016-06-17T21:52:44 <colinclark> PR #74
2016-06-17T21:52:53 <colinclark> it shouldn\'t happen on master
2016-06-17T21:54:32 <gloob> I get this in windows/master right now
2016-06-17T21:56:18 <colinclark> hmm
2016-06-17T21:58:04 <Bosmon> Hi colinclark, avtar etc.
2016-06-17T21:58:08 <colinclark> hello Bosmon
2016-06-17T21:58:17 <Bosmon> I\'ve been consistently unable to get the vagrant VM to work for the linux repo
2016-06-17T21:58:24 <colinclark> ok
2016-06-17T21:58:28 <colinclark> what\'s your experience?
2016-06-17T21:58:36 <Bosmon> A somewhat familiar problem, a failure during rsync
2016-06-17T21:58:45 <Bosmon> I thought we\'d considered that this wasn\'t a winner, as a file-sharing strategy?
2016-06-17T21:58:53 <colinclark> ha
2016-06-17T21:58:54 <colinclark> "we"
2016-06-17T21:59:24 <Bosmon> Yes, by "we" I mean specifically the people I had involved, rather than my typical vague usage :)
2016-06-17T21:59:30 <colinclark> I can\'t remember the state of all that, Bosmon
2016-06-17T21:59:48 <colinclark> I just remember that avtar had to make some fairly significant changes to the way we were syncing files
2016-06-17T21:59:53 <colinclark> in order to accomodate your cygwin setup
2016-06-17T21:59:56 <Bosmon> I remember avtar saying that he had abandoned attempts to make rsync work with respect to windows hosts
2016-06-17T22:00:02 <colinclark> yes
2016-06-17T22:00:08 <colinclark> he\'s off now
2016-06-17T22:00:08 <gloob> http://www.awesomescreenshot.com/showImage?img_id=1336233
2016-06-17T22:00:28 <Bosmon> gloob - if you\'re getting "dedupe" warnings, it means you must still be bound to some very old dependencies
2016-06-17T22:00:50 <colinclark> Bosmon: Your new branch PR is also evoking them, sadly
2016-06-17T22:00:51 <gloob> Im getting the jqunit error
2016-06-17T22:00:57 <gloob> in windows/master
2016-06-17T22:00:58 <Bosmon> node-jqunit shouldn\'t be added to windows
2016-06-17T22:01:07 <Bosmon> It is meant to exist only as a dependency of universal
2016-06-17T22:01:10 <colinclark> indeed
2016-06-17T22:01:19 <colinclark> I guess that was the case
2016-06-17T22:01:21 <gloob> ok, so it doesn\'t hurts
2016-06-17T22:01:25 <colinclark> however the tests do not run :)
2016-06-17T22:01:31 <gloob> the tests runs for me
2016-06-17T22:01:31 <colinclark> as you can see in my first screenshot
2016-06-17T22:02:11 <Bosmon> Ok, so one of you can run the tests, and one of you can\'t?
2016-06-17T22:02:17 <colinclark> no
2016-06-17T22:02:24 <colinclark> let\'s simplify here
2016-06-17T22:02:30 <colinclark> gloob is having problems with master
2016-06-17T22:02:47 <gloob> excessive simplification
2016-06-17T22:03:01 <colinclark> I am having problems with your GPII-1848 branch
2016-06-17T22:03:26 <gloob> the only problem Im having with the windows/master is the jqunit include
2016-06-17T22:03:33 <gloob> the rest is fine, or works as expected
2016-06-17T22:03:40 <Bosmon> Just for general reference, before we buckle down to this problem, here are the problems I am having with linux in master: http://pastie.org/10881502
2016-06-17T22:03:40 <gloob> the problem we have is in the CI platform
2016-06-17T22:03:43 <colinclark> What does that mean, the jqunit include?
2016-06-17T22:03:58 <gloob> the same fatal error in your first screenshot
2016-06-17T22:04:11 <gloob> that appears in my screenshot here http://www.awesomescreenshot.com/showImage?img_id=1336233
2016-06-17T22:04:13 <colinclark> Off a fresh, unmodified master branch?
2016-06-17T22:04:16 <gloob> yes
2016-06-17T22:04:24 <gloob> but it runs the tests anyway
2016-06-17T22:04:28 <colinclark> gloob: I just don\'t want to give that site access to my google account :P
2016-06-17T22:04:30 <gloob> besides that fatal error
2016-06-17T22:04:35 <gloob> dont tell me that
2016-06-17T22:04:39 <colinclark> hahaha
2016-06-17T22:04:41 <gloob> that you need login
2016-06-17T22:04:45 <Bosmon> Hi - I can\'t see your awesomescreenshot because it requires me to have a Google+ account : P
2016-06-17T22:04:45 <gloob> that\'s pretty crap
2016-06-17T22:05:06 <gloob> afu
2016-06-17T22:05:08 <colinclark> you\'d think they\'d only require you to sign up to post images
2016-06-17T22:05:15 <gloob> pretty innocent
2016-06-17T22:05:22 <gloob> let me upload somewhere
2016-06-17T22:05:28 <colinclark> Bosmon: I think unfortunately we\'ll have to wait for avtar to help with the Linux VM
2016-06-17T22:05:31 <colinclark> which means Monday
2016-06-17T22:05:36 <Bosmon> It\'s ok, looks like I can create a non-bound account
2016-06-17T22:05:36 <Bosmon> sec
2016-06-17T22:06:10 <Bosmon> Ok
2016-06-17T22:06:16 <Bosmon> I\'ve got an account and I still can\'t see your image
2016-06-17T22:06:26 <Bosmon> I am immediately becoming unfond of this site : P
2016-06-17T22:07:01 <colinclark> gloob: I\'m just testing on upstream/master here
2016-06-17T22:07:14 <colinclark> just to make sure I can\'t reproduce your issue before I merge minogian\'s branch
2016-06-17T22:07:18 <Bosmon> So, colinclark - you are only having problems with my 1848 branch, or you\'re having problems with master as well?
2016-06-17T22:07:22 <gloob> https://apps.litio.org/css/jqunit.png
2016-06-17T22:07:36 <colinclark> Bosmon: master is fine, as far as I can tell
2016-06-17T22:07:45 <colinclark> I\'ve been vagrant upping all day
2016-06-17T22:07:51 <colinclark> but maybe gloob\'s found something weird
2016-06-17T22:08:00 <colinclark> I briefly had a moment of terror that I\'d merged your branch
2016-06-17T22:08:09 <colinclark> Bosmon: Question for you, unrelated
2016-06-17T22:08:11 <colinclark> but since you\'re here
2016-06-17T22:08:35 <colinclark> to what extent can you imagine that the SPI "fails the first time" issue might have also existed on Windows 7?
2016-06-17T22:08:45 <colinclark> and we just never noticed it because we weren\'t regularly destroying VMs?
2016-06-17T22:08:45 <gloob> the high contrast?
2016-06-17T22:08:46 <Bosmon> This line in trunk is faulty: https://github.com/GPII/windows/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/registryResolver/test/testRegistryResolver.js#L21
2016-06-17T22:08:53 <Bosmon> "this should never work"
2016-06-17T22:09:10 <Bosmon> So I\'m quite interested how anyone is seeing this work at all
2016-06-17T22:09:21 <Bosmon> This module was renamed "node-jqunit" some time ago
2016-06-17T22:09:24 <colinclark> gloob: you win :)

2016-06-17T19:52:56 <colinclark> gtirloni: no kidding
2016-06-17T19:53:03 <colinclark> my entire computer crashed the other day
2016-06-17T19:53:16 <colinclark> I\'ve literally never seen 0 bytes free on my disk until then
2016-06-17T19:53:27 <colinclark> though I\'m fairly convinced it was Firefox\'s fault, not our love of automation
2016-06-17T19:53:43 <gtirloni> the windows box in indeed very big.. unfortunately i don\'t see a way around that
2016-06-17T19:53:54 <gtirloni> the linux boxes are pretty minimal though (<600MB)
2016-06-17T19:54:57 <colinclark> gtirloni: they\'d be even tinier if alpine or atomic were viable
2016-06-17T19:55:01 <colinclark> the linux ones
2016-06-17T19:55:08 <colinclark> although I guess in this case we\'re testing the real deal
2016-06-17T19:55:17 <colinclark> i.e. a linux box that humans can use :)
2016-06-17T19:55:22 <gtirloni> i keep trying to think of alternatives bug they all come back to each developer getting a physical machine with win10/linux and OS refreshes over the network... in other words, massive headaches
2016-06-17T19:55:31 <gtirloni> yeah
2016-06-17T19:55:32 <colinclark> yup
2016-06-17T19:55:53 <colinclark> I\'ve realized how much of this particular wave of automation really is dependent on the model of a company buying all their employees the same laptop
2016-06-17T19:56:12 <colinclark> whereas in open source you have so much diverse hardware and OSes
2016-06-17T19:56:15 <gtirloni> for microservices, containers will be enough i think.. specially if docker for win/mac Beta gets released so it\'s a more seamless experience
2016-06-17T19:56:21 <colinclark> including the Microsoft Twins, avtar and Bosmon
2016-06-17T19:56:55 <colinclark> gtirloni: yup, I think it\'s going to be good--the new Docker
2016-06-17T19:57:27 <colinclark> I was saying to simonjb that we should still look into some kind of lightweight container or VM for distributing the Nexus
2016-06-17T20:04:49 <avtar> ms twins...
2016-06-17T20:04:50 <avtar> :|
2016-06-17T20:08:31 <gtirloni> avtar, you should say something about "macOS" becoming iOS
2016-06-17T20:09:29 <colinclark> ha
2016-06-17T20:10:43 * wale joined the channel
2016-06-17T20:12:09 <alanharnum> colinclark: the nexus is a pretty perfect case for containerization
2016-06-17T20:12:16 <avtar> gtirloni: https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=76236#p356231
2016-06-17T20:12:49 <alanharnum> since it\'s a distributed architecture anywy
2016-06-17T20:13:13 <avtar> we do provide a fairly small amount of vram to the win10 guest https://github.com/GPII/windows/blob/master/Vagrantfile#L26
2016-06-17T20:13:27 <colinclark> alanharnum: I\'m glad you agree
2016-06-17T20:13:43 <gtirloni> avtar, i cant go higher than that here though
2016-06-17T20:15:12 <gtirloni> avtar, maybe w/ 3d accel enabled i can
2016-06-17T20:17:45 * anvk has quit
2016-06-17T20:18:27 <avtar> perhaps this is a moot point if c2100s are going to be used as build nodes instead of the mac minis
2016-06-17T20:18:53 <avtar> in which case they won\'t be great hosts to depend on for 3d accelerated VMs
2016-06-17T20:20:42 <gtirloni> i think they have some PCIe slots that could hold a few gtx 1080\'s
2016-06-17T20:26:09 <avtar> i guess colinclark is always talking about 1080s
2016-06-17T20:27:02 <colinclark> if only there was a mac that shipped with them
2016-06-17T20:30:00 <gtirloni> this could be our default dev laptop -- http://www.razerzone.com/gaming-systems/razer-blade

2016-06-17T21:00:05 <cindyli> Bosmon and wannabeCitizen, i issued two pull request, one is on infusion repo to move the resource loader out of the prefs framework into the core framework, also added a test case to demonstrate how to use the resource loader - https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/721
2016-06-17T21:00:27 <cindyli> the other is the documentation for it: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/pull/90
2016-06-17T21:00:51 <cindyli> can you guys review them? thanks
2016-06-17T21:01:34 <wannabeCitizen> I can definitely review the documentation cindyli since I\xe2\x80\x99m probably a good litmus test as a learner. However, maybe Bosmon should review the framework change?
2016-06-17T21:02:05 <cindyli> wannabeCitizen: you probably can have a look on the test case to see if it\'s learner friendly ;)
2016-06-17T21:02:18 <cindyli> the similar case is included in the doc tho
2016-06-17T21:17:07 <gloob> colinclark: ey
2016-06-17T21:17:17 <colinclark> quick question for you
2016-06-17T21:17:35 <gloob> shoot
2016-06-17T21:17:36 <colinclark> I filed this while working on minogian\'s pull request: https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-1851
2016-06-17T21:17:56 <colinclark> I just want to make sure a) I\'m thinking reasonably and b) that this is fully roadmapped for the SILO team
2016-06-17T21:18:12 <colinclark> the a) part is, does it make sense to keep an installer we don\'t use in the repo?
2016-06-17T21:18:29 <gloob> I saw that, and I\'m with you
2016-06-17T21:18:32 <colinclark> and the b) part is, will the new WiX installer include the ability for someone to, for example, not install one or both of the listeners?
2016-06-17T21:18:37 <gloob> if we start to add stuff that is easy to do
2016-06-17T21:18:38 <gloob> well
2016-06-17T21:18:45 <gloob> it would looks like maven
2016-06-17T21:18:50 <gloob> about b
2016-06-17T21:18:53 <colinclark> MAVEN!
2016-06-17T21:18:56 <colinclark> I so don\'t miss that
2016-06-17T21:18:59 <gloob> they have abstract topics
2016-06-17T21:19:04 <colinclark> ok
2016-06-17T21:19:15 <colinclark> I don\'t know much about Windows
2016-06-17T21:19:15 <gloob> so, I will talk with them next Monday
2016-06-17T21:19:20 <colinclark> but on the Mac I can often go into a "Customize" mode
2016-06-17T21:19:25 <gloob> I think there\'s some confusion
2016-06-17T21:19:29 <colinclark> and uncheck some stuff that I don\'t want
2016-06-17T21:19:36 <colinclark> I can imagine that some stuff is required--you\'d have to install it
2016-06-17T21:19:37 <colinclark> most stuff
2016-06-17T21:19:45 <colinclark> but that the listeners would be something you could choose not to install
2016-06-17T21:20:15 <gloob> yes, but not to be installed doesn\'t means not to be compiled and tested
2016-06-17T21:20:20 <colinclark> yes
2016-06-17T21:20:22 <gloob> in the same way we do with everything
2016-06-17T21:20:23 <colinclark> exactly
2016-06-17T21:20:32 <gloob> so, I fully agree with your issue
2016-06-17T21:20:33 <colinclark> avtar: I think I\'m going to start dreaming of "vagrant up"
2016-06-17T21:20:36 <gloob> I wll link with the master issue
2016-06-17T21:20:41 <gloob> link it*
2016-06-17T21:20:47 <colinclark> looking at the code, he might well be building it during the provisioning stage
2016-06-17T21:20:53 <colinclark> it may be that avtar and I were confused
2016-06-17T21:21:04 <gloob> probably
2016-06-17T21:21:14 <avtar> i\'ve been confused in the past
2016-06-17T21:21:19 <avtar> i try to avoid it now
2016-06-17T21:21:19 <colinclark> https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/71/files#diff-4ef0516c2bb699b581a8764bfafd89efR6
2016-06-17T21:21:25 <colinclark> I\'m ALWAYS CONFUSED
2016-06-17T21:21:26 <gloob> avtar: recently, you mean?
2016-06-17T21:21:47 <avtar> i didn\'t mean recently but i guess you\'re saying something now
2016-06-17T21:21:52 <avtar> and i\'m kinda confused
2016-06-17T21:22:01 <colinclark> hahaha
2016-06-17T21:22:01 <gloob> to be confused is good, it means that you are evaluating different options
2016-06-17T21:22:09 <avtar> gloob and his zesty comebacks
2016-06-17T21:22:11 <avtar> i\'m a fan
2016-06-17T21:22:14 <avtar> :D
2016-06-17T21:22:18 <colinclark> mondo gloob!
2016-06-17T21:22:27 <gloob> best channel for your childrens!
2016-06-17T21:22:31 <colinclark> :)
2016-06-17T21:22:39 <colinclark> I bet gtirloni\'s cats watch it too
2016-06-17T21:23:04 <colinclark> maybe we should start a "vagrant up" support group
2016-06-17T21:23:09 <gloob> hahaha
2016-06-17T21:23:19 <colinclark> i\'m guessing we\'ve all be provisioning a lot of virtual machines in the past 48 hours
2016-06-17T21:23:24 <colinclark> all been
2016-06-17T21:23:35 <gloob> now I\'m digging in my adiction
2016-06-17T21:23:36 <avtar> i kinda lost count
2016-06-17T21:23:41 <colinclark> Sadly my attempt with Bosmon\'s hot new branch was a failure
2016-06-17T21:23:45 <gloob> and doing vagrant snapshot push and pop
2016-06-17T21:23:50 <colinclark> ooh
2016-06-17T21:23:53 <colinclark> advanced vagrant
2016-06-17T21:23:57 <avtar> yeah, snapshots are hot
2016-06-17T21:24:02 <colinclark> wow
2016-06-17T21:24:03 <colinclark> when?
2016-06-17T21:24:05 <colinclark> when are they hot?
2016-06-17T21:24:32 <gloob> now
2016-06-17T21:24:37 <gloob> it\'s happening
2016-06-17T21:24:38 <colinclark> do you take a snapshot right after you\'ve provisioned the VM or something?
2016-06-17T21:24:49 <gloob> after provisioning
2016-06-17T21:24:50 <avtar> colinclark: when there\'s a point in a process that you are unsure of then it\'s great to comment that and everything else after it out, create a snapshot, and then continue provisioning
2016-06-17T21:24:51 <gloob> AND BEST PART
2016-06-17T21:24:55 <gloob> before running unit tests
2016-06-17T21:24:57 <gloob> !!
2016-06-17T21:25:09 <avtar> if things don\'t work out like you wanted you can restore the snapshot and vagrant up to restore it
2016-06-17T21:25:19 <avtar> and mainly before running tests like gloob mentioned
2016-06-17T21:25:27 <gloob> by the way, I have localized the problem with high contrast
2016-06-17T21:25:28 <gloob> is coming
2016-06-17T21:25:33 <colinclark> oh wow!
2016-06-17T21:25:39 <gloob> it\'s funny funny
2016-06-17T21:25:51 <avtar> gloob: how funny?
2016-06-17T21:26:37 <gloob> like the third sequel of scary movies
2016-06-17T21:27:17 <gloob> anyway, it seems under control
2016-06-17T21:27:37 <gloob> my plan is to update the issue in jira, create new pr, add text and text and ping Bosmon
2016-06-17T21:31:14 <colinclark> I guess I really am confused
2016-06-17T21:31:22 <colinclark> It looks to me like the installers have indeed been built
2016-06-17T21:31:43 <colinclark> from a single incantation of our holy chant
2016-06-17T21:31:49 <gloob> yes, there\'s some previous work done
2016-06-17T21:32:30 <colinclark> there are such marvellous windmills out there to tilt at
2016-06-17T21:32:55 <gloob> for which reason?
2016-06-17T21:36:55 <colinclark> any reason
2016-06-17T21:36:56 <colinclark> that\'s why they\'re windmills
2016-06-17T21:37:06 <colinclark> does anyone know where the installer goes when it is built?
2016-06-17T21:37:39 <gloob> yes, we created the new repo for it
2016-06-17T21:37:54 <gloob> in fact you created it, colinclark :)
2016-06-17T21:37:59 <gloob> let me look for it
2016-06-17T21:38:03 <colinclark> hahaha
2016-06-17T21:38:04 <colinclark> no no
2016-06-17T21:38:07 <colinclark> not that one
2016-06-17T21:38:08 <colinclark> THIS one

2016-06-17T14:08:50 <Justin_o> avtar: hello
2016-06-17T14:08:59 <avtar> hey Justin_o
2016-06-17T14:09:18 <Justin_o> avtar: hi, i\'m trying to add source maps to infusion for the infusion-all file
2016-06-17T14:09:49 <Justin_o> avtar: i\'ve been having mixed results so far, but something I\'m finding today is that if i run my code through the vagrant vm web server, the map files don\'t work
2016-06-17T14:10:03 <Justin_o> but if i run it from MAMP it works.. at least in FF
2016-06-17T14:10:14 <Justin_o> i wonder if they aren\'t being encoded properly or if something else is happening
2016-06-17T14:10:24 <Justin_o> any thoughts on that
2016-06-17T14:12:46 <gtirloni> Justin_o, do you see any errors in the network tab of devtools?
2016-06-17T14:12:56 * cindyli1 joined the channel
2016-06-17T14:13:21 <avtar> Justin_o: sorry, my mouse died
2016-06-17T14:14:06 <avtar> what gtirloni said and also is your work in a repo that i could try?
2016-06-17T14:15:26 <Justin_o> avtar, gtirloni: the code is in this branch https://github.com/jobara/infusion/tree/FLUID-5832
2016-06-17T14:15:54 <Justin_o> there are two different versions of the source maps, 1) for source builds ( grunt --source=true ) and one for minified ( grunt )
2016-06-17T14:16:08 <Justin_o> they are made by different systems, so you\'d need to test both
2016-06-17T14:17:09 <Justin_o> for testing i\'m running the unpacking the built zip file, opening the uploader demo, and replacing all the js imports that link files from the src directory to use the single infusion-all.js file
2016-06-17T14:17:59 <Justin_o> avtar, gtirloni: i\'ll double check if there are errors.. i didn\'t see much yesterday, but in some case in chrome would get "failed to parse" errors for the map even though the file was at the specified path
2016-06-17T14:19:58 <avtar> Justin_o: ok
2016-06-17T14:20:29 <avtar> just a heads-up that i\'ll probably be able to look at this on monday
2016-06-17T14:20:59 <Justin_o> avtar: okay, i\'m almost done for the day anyways, will you be in the office?
2016-06-17T14:21:17 <avtar> on monday? yes
2016-06-17T14:21:36 <Justin_o> gtirloni, avtar: by the way, tried again getting "Failed to parse SourceMap: http://localhost:8888/infusion/products/infusion/infusion-all.js.map" error in chrome\'s console when run from the vagrant vm web server
2016-06-17T14:22:09 <Justin_o> nothing shows up in the network tab when it works and when it doesn\'t
2016-06-17T14:22:50 <Justin_o> avtar: if we don\'t figure things out before hand, did you want to pair with me on it on monday?
2016-06-17T14:23:00 <avtar> sure
2016-06-17T14:24:41 <Justin_o> avtar: thanks
2016-06-17T14:34:21 <Justin_o> Bosmon2: hello, do you think this PR is still relevant.. should i bring it up-to-date for more review? https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/566

2016-06-17T14:50:24 <Bosmon> We should mothball it until the projects that require it become active again
2016-06-17T14:50:33 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay
2016-06-17T14:50:41 <Justin_o> Bosmon: what does mothball mean again?
2016-06-17T14:50:54 <Bosmon> It means we put a marker with that name on the pull request :)
2016-06-17T14:50:55 <Justin_o> and do we have a wiki page or something to explain all the PR tags?
2016-06-17T14:51:06 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i got that, but what does it actually mean :)

2016-06-17T14:53:14 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks, we should create a wiki page to explain all the PR labels

2016-06-17T16:26:43 <gloob> did you or gtirloni finds any new hint?
2016-06-17T16:26:57 <gloob> find*
2016-06-17T16:27:00 <avtar> yes
2016-06-17T16:27:04 <gloob> YES
2016-06-17T16:27:29 * bens joined the channel
2016-06-17T16:27:55 <avtar> the most current info we have at hand is that disabling 3d acceleration http://pastie.org/10880998 results in a more stable virtualized windows environment
2016-06-17T16:29:07 <gloob> it seems so lateral
2016-06-17T16:30:17 <avtar> which results in more predictable behaviour where the gpii.tests.windows.killProcess test is concerned https://ci.gpii.net/job/windows-unit-tests/13/console.html (that\'s with 3d accel disabled)
2016-06-17T16:30:37 <avtar> it appears to be a issue with virtualbox https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/10879
2016-06-17T16:31:11 <avtar> gtirloni is in the process of building a new box with the latest vbox guest additions to see if that makes a difference
2016-06-17T16:31:18 <avtar> otherwise i\'ll post what we know so far to the arch list
2016-06-17T16:32:06 <gloob> I still thinks that some environment vars are not well setted or something is not equal than in the dev boxes
2016-06-17T16:32:19 <gloob> because the jqunit problem
2016-06-17T16:32:58 <gloob> maybe there\'s some node packages intalled through apt or whatever packager manager use the distro where jenkins live?
2016-06-17T16:33:04 <gloob> any npm install -g?
2016-06-17T16:33:17 <gloob> anyway, yes, some discussion would be worth
2016-06-17T16:33:50 <gloob> amatas gives me his roles for creating the jenkins instances
2016-06-17T16:34:00 <gloob> but at the moment is low priority for me
2016-06-17T16:34:06 <avtar> gloob: but i see the "Cannot find module \'jqunit\'" error in VMs on my local machine as well
2016-06-17T16:34:15 <gloob> oh yes?
2016-06-17T16:34:23 <avtar> quite reliably
2016-06-17T16:34:35 <gloob> it\'s gpii/windows master, right?
2016-06-17T16:34:39 <avtar> yup
2016-06-17T16:34:48 <gloob> ok, I\'ll try with that
2016-06-17T16:35:33 <avtar> i would suggest creating a snapshot of the vm right after it\'s provisioned so that you can try different solutions without waiting for it to provision all over again
2016-06-17T16:35:41 <gloob> yes

2016-06-17T17:42:07 <Bosmon> Cool
2016-06-17T17:52:22 <Bosmon> wannabeCitizen - did my answers on the mailing list make sense?

2016-06-17T18:38:12 <colinclark> I\'m longing for a weekend when I can sit in IRC
2016-06-17T18:38:14 <colinclark> and hack
2016-06-17T19:04:07 <colinclark> simonjb: There seems to be some detail about Ableton Link here: http://ableton.github.io/linkkit/
2016-06-17T19:05:34 <simonjb> thanks colinclark I\'ll take a look
2016-06-17T19:06:30 <colinclark> This slide deck from Roger Dannenberg is on the OSC site: http://opensoundcontrol.org/files/dannenberg-clocksync.pdf
2016-06-17T19:07:18 <colinclark> It focuses on clock synchronization, I guess because that\'s the only way to make OSC timestamps viable
2016-06-17T19:07:37 <colinclark> presumably something like NTP is still subject to inaccuracies based on latency between the client and the NTP server
2016-06-17T19:15:00 <simonjb> colinclark: this seems like a good starting point on NTP: https://www.eecis.udel.edu/~mills/ntp/html/warp.html
2016-06-17T19:15:23 <colinclark> thanks
2016-06-17T19:15:38 <colinclark> I remember implementing osc.js\' NTP timestamps was pretty mind-bending at the time

2016-06-17T19:37:51 <avtar> that\'s a good looking package.json :P
2016-06-17T19:38:59 <avtar> will gpii/linux be next to get the grunt-gpii removal treatment?

2016-06-17T19:43:12 <colinclark> apparently it took a bit of effort to get it to not fill up his C: \\ drive
2016-06-17T19:46:39 <gtirloni> it worries me developers are working with just a few megabytes of free space

2016-06-17T00:01:57 <avtar> even more so than jenkins
2016-06-17T00:02:00 <gloob> isn't that enough?
2016-06-17T00:02:08 <avtar> you didn't look up 'twss'?
2016-06-17T00:02:14 <gloob> nope
2016-06-17T00:02:19 <gtirloni> you shouldn't
2016-06-17T00:02:25 <gtirloni> don't play avtar's games
2016-06-17T00:02:27 <gloob> magic work
2016-06-17T00:02:29 <gloob> word
2016-06-17T00:02:32 <avtar> you performed the wrong google search
2016-06-17T00:02:35 <avtar> or bing
2016-06-17T00:02:36 <avtar> whatever
2016-06-17T00:02:58 <avtar> python's getting installed
2016-06-17T00:03:04 <gloob> twss is the history of my life
2016-06-17T00:03:13 <avtar> you did look it up
2016-06-17T00:03:19 <avtar> and now that pleases me
2016-06-17T00:03:45 <avtar> the salad betrayal has been forgotten
2016-06-17T00:03:47 * yzen joined the channel
2016-06-17T00:03:51 <gloob> nah, its ok
2016-06-17T00:03:52 <gtirloni> i regret looking that up years ago, the jokes never stopped since then
2016-06-17T00:04:13 <gloob> I cannot afford for my personal plane yet
2016-06-17T00:05:15 <avtar> gotta have goals
2016-06-17T00:05:17 <gloob> gtirloni: I live with my wife and my daughter, imagine the meaning of twss
2016-06-17T00:05:40 <gloob> I'm lost, I'm sold
2016-06-17T00:06:32 <avtar> we're almost there
2016-06-17T00:06:42 <gloob> is it running?
2016-06-17T00:06:52 <gloob> the internal links man
2016-06-17T00:07:03 <gloob> could I apply for a vpn or something?
2016-06-17T00:07:24 <avtar> gloob: that's actually a great idea
2016-06-17T00:07:34 <avtar> alfredo has some automation for openvpn
2016-06-17T00:07:36 <gloob> well, better than fix that no
2016-06-17T00:07:44 <gloob> but it will fixed it
2016-06-17T00:07:44 <gloob> xD
2016-06-17T00:07:52 <gloob> TO BE HONEST
2016-06-17T00:08:02 <gtirloni> modsecurity is coming to save the world, no more double jenkins addresses
2016-06-17T00:08:12 <gloob> oh yes, it's coming
2016-06-17T00:08:42 <gtirloni> sadly, it's up to me to make that a reality so our chances of survival aren't that great
2016-06-17T00:08:45 <gtirloni> but i'm trying :)
2016-06-17T00:09:06 <avtar> gloob: do you have a static ip?
2016-06-17T00:09:12 <gloob> no
2016-06-17T00:09:18 <gloob> but I have a fixed domain
2016-06-17T00:09:34 <gloob> with a volatile ip
2016-06-17T00:09:41 <gloob> that gets updated
2016-06-17T00:09:44 <gloob> etc etc
2016-06-17T00:09:49 * yzen has quit
2016-06-17T00:11:11 <gtirloni> i think there is a module for nginx that can resolve domain names so we can allow that (instead of an IP). it requires recompiling nginx.. which i'm already doing for modsecurity so let's see how that goes. we should have something up in a week or so
2016-06-17T00:11:13 <gloob> I have some server that could use as a proxy
2016-06-17T00:11:36 <gtirloni> ah a server works, you can `ssh -L` to create a tunnel and access jenkins through that
2016-06-17T00:11:44 <gloob> in example
2016-06-17T00:12:01 <gloob> axon.litio.org
2016-06-17T00:12:42 <gtirloni> ssh -L 9000:ci-int.gpii.net:443 axon.litio.org  .... then you access https://localhost:9000 for jenkins
2016-06-17T00:12:44 <gtirloni> something like that
2016-06-17T00:12:51 <gloob> yes
2016-06-17T00:13:03 <gloob> for me is fine
2016-06-17T00:13:23 <gloob> I have irssi running on that machine among other useless stuff
2016-06-17T00:13:41 <gloob> so I have always a ssh+tmux connection
2016-06-17T00:13:50 <gtirloni> cool, i've allowed that IP then
2016-06-17T00:13:56 <gloob> thank you, sir
2016-06-17T00:14:00 <gtirloni> yw!
2016-06-17T00:14:06 <gloob> np
2016-06-17T00:14:33 <gloob> from now? =)
2016-06-17T00:14:45 <gtirloni> yep, you can try
2016-06-17T00:14:49 <gloob> trying
2016-06-17T00:15:54 <avtar> i think vbox needs to be restarted on the build node
2016-06-17T00:16:19 <gtirloni> avtar, that's fine, we messed a lot with it today. i think we should call it a day.. it's pretty late already
2016-06-17T00:16:29 <gtirloni> we can try again tomorrow with a clear mind
2016-06-17T00:16:34 <gloob> gtirloni: ty again, now it runs flawless and without hair loss
2016-06-17T00:16:41 <gtirloni> gloob, cool
2016-06-17T00:17:03 <gtirloni> gloob, btw, i'm a big fan of your kids tv channel in brazil: http://mundogloob.globo.com/
2016-06-17T00:17:15 <gloob> arghhhh
2016-06-17T00:17:16 <gloob> no
2016-06-17T00:17:30 <gloob> there's some hardcoded linking
2016-06-17T00:17:44 <gloob> or I tunneling through 80 or wont work
2016-06-17T00:17:53 <gtirloni> it's sending you to ci-int... ? maybe you can mess with /etc/hosts in your machine to point ci-int.gpii.net to 127.0.0.1
2016-06-17T00:17:54 <gloob> gtirloni: hahaha, cool, I receive some free mentions
2016-06-17T00:18:11 <gloob> gtirloni: but in that case I need to bridge to 80
2016-06-17T00:18:18 <gloob> that I dislike it so much
2016-06-17T00:18:22 <gtirloni> ah, it's pointing to 80.. crappy
2016-06-17T00:18:23 <gloob> anyway
2016-06-17T00:18:27 <gloob> we will see
2016-06-17T00:18:28 <gtirloni> ok, we can take a look at this tomorrow
2016-06-17T00:18:30 <gloob> thank you gaus
2016-06-17T00:18:32 <avtar> gloob: same issue though
2016-06-17T00:18:33 <gtirloni> my brain is shutting down
2016-06-17T00:18:36 <gloob> avtar: the dinner is still not clear
2016-06-17T00:18:49 <gtirloni> gloob avtar: thank you for staying late troubleshooting crazy stuff!
2016-06-17T00:19:00 <gtirloni> cya

2016-06-17T00:20:30 <avtar> https://ci.gpii.net/job/windows-unit-tests/11/console.html
2016-06-17T00:20:40 <gloob> ty
2016-06-17T00:20:57 <gloob> ok, we can reproduce the weirdness
2016-06-17T00:21:02 <gloob> let's see tomorrow
2016-06-17T00:21:32 <gloob> what amazed me is the error 5
