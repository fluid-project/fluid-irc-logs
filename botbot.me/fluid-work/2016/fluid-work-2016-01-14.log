2016-01-14T20:12:46 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i filed a couple of prefs framework JIRAS https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5841 and https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5842
2016-01-14T20:14:22 <Bosmon> Thanks, Justin_o
2016-01-14T20:14:26 <Bosmon> FLUID-5842 is interesting
2016-01-14T20:19:50 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yah, i\'m not sure how much of an issue that will be in general. However, if you look in the channel earlier today I had to recommend using "{prefsEditor}.model.preferences.gpii_firstDiscovery_language"
2016-01-14T20:19:59 <Justin_o> to get access to the language model value
2016-01-14T20:20:05 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes
2016-01-14T20:20:22 <Bosmon> Presumably the utilities that the builder uses to compute preferences paths are public
2016-01-14T20:20:38 <Justin_o> Bosmon: some modifications in the language enactor might also solve this particular issue though.
2016-01-14T20:21:25 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes they are, but still probably not convenient to use in code as you\'d also have to figure out what preference type you are trying to access.
2016-01-14T20:21:44 <Bosmon> Justin_o - what do you mean by "what preference type"?
2016-01-14T20:22:26 <Justin_o> Bosmon: for example https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/preferences/js/StarterSchemas.js#L71
2016-01-14T20:22:58 <Bosmon> Ah yes
2016-01-14T20:23:03 <Bosmon> The "common grade name" : P
2016-01-14T20:23:37 <Bosmon> We should have utilities to search these too
2016-01-14T20:24:33 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes, that would be good
2016-01-14T20:32:13 <Justin_o> anastasiac, cindyli: where did we leave off with the name for the prefs framework gpii integration server repo
2016-01-14T20:33:56 <cindyli> Justin_o: we were talking if this server should be named as infusion-server or more specific for the prefs framework use
2016-01-14T20:34:40 <Justin_o> cindyli: ah yes, i think calling it prefsServer will be confusing with the actual gpii preference server, so i\'d like to avoid that
2016-01-14T20:35:02 <Justin_o> cindyli: and i guess there was a question of what this does.. is it an infusion web server or something specific to connecting it to gpii for example
2016-01-14T20:35:05 <Justin_o> i think it\'s the latter
2016-01-14T20:37:52 <cindyli> that\'s true, but potentially the repo can be used for any other cases when serving up infusion thru a web server is needed. i agree for now the code in there will solely be for gpii connection, Justin_o
2016-01-14T20:38:36 <Justin_o> well it\'ll be for both
2016-01-14T20:38:48 <Justin_o> but the main purpose will be for connecting to GPII
2016-01-14T20:42:35 <Justin_o> cindyli: okay, so if we make it a generic server for serving up infusion, i want to make sure that the name doesn\'t make people think it is a server implemented infusion.. that is, i don\'t want to confuse it with kettle
2016-01-14T20:42:37 <Justin_o> if you know what i mean
2016-01-14T20:43:19 <cindyli> that\'s a good point, Justin_o
2016-01-14T20:47:41 <Justin_o> anastasiac: what do you think infusion-server is?
2016-01-14T20:47:58 <Justin_o> or infusion-web-server
2016-01-14T20:48:19 <anastasiac> Justin_o: I suggested that name after discussion with cindyli about what is being served up
2016-01-14T20:48:43 <anastasiac> my understanding from the conversation was that it\xe2\x80\x99s a server serving up infusion, so: infusion-server
2016-01-14T20:48:44 <Justin_o> anastasiac: ah, so you aren\'t a good person to ask then ;)
2016-01-14T20:49:10 <anastasiac> ah, now I understand the purpose of the question
2016-01-14T20:49:17 <anastasiac> and no, I\xe2\x80\x99m not the best person
2016-01-14T20:49:34 <anastasiac> maybe michelled could opine?
2016-01-14T20:56:24 <michelled> Justin_o: yeah, I\'m not sure I understand what the difference is between Kettle and infusion-server
2016-01-14T20:57:08 <Justin_o> michelled: that\'s what i was afraid of ;(
2016-01-14T20:57:26 <Justin_o> michelled: any suggestions on the name
2016-01-14T20:58:12 <michelled> unfortunately not. Bosmon, do you have a suggestion?
2016-01-14T20:58:57 <Bosmon> What is "a generic server for serving up infusion"?
2016-01-14T20:59:44 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I think the question that michelled is asking is... what *IS* this thing you are talking about? : P
2016-01-14T20:59:53 <michelled> :)
2016-01-14T20:59:58 <michelled> yes, you are right
2016-01-14T21:00:46 <Justin_o> Bosmon: for the prefs framework integration with the gpii preferences server we\'ll need to build some server side piece for communication with the security layer. We figure that, like we did for the first discovery tool, this server might as well also act as a web server for infusion.
2016-01-14T21:00:49 <Justin_o> michelled: ^
2016-01-14T21:01:12 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I think the role of this thing still isn\'t clear
2016-01-14T21:01:19 <Justin_o> cindyli was suggested that this really could just be used as a generic web server for serving up infusion regardless of gpii connection
2016-01-14T21:01:26 <Bosmon> Who might need a "web server for infusion"?
2016-01-14T21:01:39 <Bosmon> And how is this different from a server which serves up any other static content?
2016-01-14T21:02:06 <Justin_o> Bosmon: so this came up specifically for the communication with the gpii security layer
2016-01-14T21:02:25 <Bosmon> Ok well, you know what\'s coming next :)
2016-01-14T21:02:30 <Bosmon> What is "the GPII security layer"? : P
2016-01-14T21:02:38 <Justin_o> is simonjb around :)
2016-01-14T21:02:40 <Bosmon> I think I asked this question with respect to your docs pull .......
2016-01-14T21:03:08 <Justin_o> Bosmon: :) yes, you did
2016-01-14T21:03:28 <Bosmon> What facilities do you understand "The GPII security layer" to provide to you?
2016-01-14T21:03:48 <Justin_o> Bosmon: the oauth2 interface basically
2016-01-14T21:04:01 <Bosmon> Justin_o - which bit(s) of it specifically?
2016-01-14T21:04:47 <Justin_o> Bosmon: in this case it will be https://wiki.gpii.net/w/GPII_OAuth_2_Guide#Authorization_Code_Grant
2016-01-14T21:05:29 <Bosmon> Justin_o - ok - so could a more specific name for what you are referring to be the "authorization server"?
2016-01-14T21:05:35 <Justin_o> although right now this might support read only, and we\'ll need to be able write as well, but i think it\'s the same grant type
2016-01-14T21:06:36 <Justin_o> Bosmon: well i think there is an authorization server in gpii already, this would just be the piece that communicates between the prefs framework ( in a browser ) and the gpii\'s authorization server
2016-01-14T21:07:19 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I mean, when you say "communication with the GPII security layer", might you more specifically be meaning "communication with the GPII authorization server"?
2016-01-14T21:07:35 <Justin_o> Bosmon: ah yes
2016-01-14T21:10:10 <Bosmon> Justin_o - "ah yes" meaning "yes I mean that" or "I recognise what you are talking about"? : P
2016-01-14T21:12:47 <Justin_o> so much ambiguity :)
2016-01-14T21:12:54 <Justin_o> i mean, "yes i mean that"
2016-01-14T21:13:06 <Bosmon> cool ok
2016-01-14T21:13:29 <Bosmon> So can we make updates in your docs to reflect that, and then in this further conversation...
2016-01-14T21:13:44 <Bosmon> Ok, so, we need to build "some server side piece for communication with the auth server"
2016-01-14T21:13:51 <Bosmon> Is the reason we need to build this thing because of the SOP?
2016-01-14T21:15:45 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i believe it\'s to reduce the chance of the access token being compromised. simonjb could probably give a more accurate description
2016-01-14T21:16:11 <Bosmon> Ok
2016-01-14T21:16:35 <Bosmon> Do we have a sketch of such a thing, or an existing implementation that does something similar, or do we need to build it from scratch?
2016-01-14T21:19:09 * danayo joined the channel
2016-01-14T21:23:53 <Justin_o> Bosmon: we had some test implementations in with oauth2 stuff, i\'m not sure if they made it into universal when the security stuff was committed there. There was also that easeit integration, but i don\'t know where the code for that is
2016-01-14T21:24:07 <Bosmon> ok
2016-01-14T21:24:32 <Bosmon> Well, I suggest we need a meeting to spec out what this thing actually is
2016-01-14T21:24:48 <Bosmon> During which we could also deal with questions of factoring and naming, etc.
2016-01-14T21:25:20 <Justin_o> Bosmon: https://github.com/GPII/universal/tree/master/examples/gpii-oauth2-sample-client-passport
2016-01-14T21:25:27 <Justin_o> i think that\'s an example of a client
2016-01-14T21:25:56 <Justin_o> Bosmon:  sure did you want to meet today.. i\'ll be around for a bit longer today, i\'ll also be here tomorrow morning EST but away in the afternoon
2016-01-14T21:26:02 <Bosmon> Justin_o - a client for the authorization server, or a client for the thing that we are now proposing to build?
2016-01-14T21:26:06 <Bosmon> Tomorrow morning EST works for me
2016-01-14T21:26:16 <Bosmon> Can you collar simonjb too?
2016-01-14T21:26:22 <Justin_o> Bosmon: it\'s more an example of the thing we are trying to build
2016-01-14T21:26:39 <simonjb> Yep, I can definitely join
2016-01-14T21:26:49 <Justin_o> simonjb: thanks, i think we definitely need your input there
2016-01-14T21:27:05 <Bosmon> Awesome
2016-01-14T21:27:07 <Justin_o> cindyli: does that time work for you as well
2016-01-14T21:27:38 <Justin_o> Bosmon, cindyli, simonjb: would 9am EST work for everyone?
2016-01-14T21:27:53 <Bosmon> Justin_o - good for me
2016-01-14T21:28:01 <Bosmon> Anyone else you think could usefully attend?
2016-01-14T21:28:34 <simonjb> Justin_o: 9am is good for me
2016-01-14T21:29:18 <Justin_o> gtirloni, avtar: would any of you be interested in attending... it\'s probably something we\'ll need to serve up at some point for a demo, and maybe for production when we upgrade all our sites to use it
2016-01-14T21:29:48 <Justin_o> i would ask alan too, but i thin he\'s gone for the day already
2016-01-14T21:30:23 <avtar> Justin_o: sure i\'ll attend
2016-01-14T21:31:11 <cindyli> 9am is good for me too
2016-01-14T21:31:29 <gtirloni> Justin_o: count me in!

2016-01-14T21:37:48 <Bosmon> What did you learn about how uglify and concat interact?
2016-01-14T21:43:19 <michelled> well, when I used uglify to do both tasks, it all worked fine. When I tried to chain the two, the source maps were not generated correctly.
2016-01-14T21:47:28 <Bosmon> michelled - cool
2016-01-14T21:47:40 <Bosmon> michelled - might you be able to make our UIO integration meeting tomorrow morning?

2016-01-14T12:57:14 <kasparnet> alanharnum: in either case, we havent bumped into antyhing related to the servers
2016-01-14T12:58:08 <simonjb> hi kasparnet -- any issues regarding the security demo?
2016-01-14T12:58:28 <kasparnet> simonjb: nope! That was working quite well

2016-01-14T12:59:13 <kasparnet> thanks simonjb
2016-01-14T12:59:49 <alanharnum> kasparnet: ok - just let me know. if you can PM me your IP there I can see about adding that to the allowed IPs for the Jenkins server that manages the containers; that will let you self-service relaunch them should the need arise

2016-01-14T15:00:57 <anastasiac> jhung, I\xe2\x80\x99ll have a look at your fluidproject.org pull request this morning
2016-01-14T15:03:17 <jhung> anastasiac: thanks.
2016-01-14T15:03:42 <zamcnema> Justin_o: I\'m currently working on setting the current templateUrl using an expander in the options of the preview definition in the firstDiscoveryEditor. The expander calls stringTemplate to take the url for the preview content "../../content" and combine it with "{that}.model.lang" and ".html" to pick out the correct template based on the language selected.
2016-01-14T15:03:59 <zamcnema> Justin_o: he isssue is that I\'m receiving an undefined language because the language is set after everything is rendered using the afterReder.setLangOnHtml in the language panel section of panel.js and everything is rerendered again if you change the language.
2016-01-14T15:04:13 <zamcnema> Justin_o: Would it be possible to set the the templateUrl of the preview using a function in the afterRender section of the panel so that the language is available when the templateUrl is set? I\'m also concerned that this could result in the preview not having content.

2016-01-14T15:54:15 <jhung> @anastasiac I updated the pull req.
2016-01-14T15:54:30 <anastasiac> k
2016-01-14T16:07:36 <Justin_o> zamcnema: so the afterREnder.setLangOnHtml should be setting the value in the DOM, but it\'s pulling from the model value. "{that}.model.lang".
2016-01-14T16:08:12 <Justin_o> It\'s possible that the expander is resolving before the "{that}.model.lang" is set though. If that\'s the case you might need to source it internally in the preview component instead.
2016-01-14T16:10:25 <Justin_o> one way to do this would be to write a new function to take the place of fluid.prefs.preview.startLoadingContainer https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/preferences/js/PrefsEditor.js#L519-L526
2016-01-14T16:11:55 <Justin_o> you could just write your own function that will do most of what this function is doing, but does your string tempting as well. The preview should have model values already which you may be able to source the lang model value from, if it isn\'t there you might have to share it from the parent.
2016-01-14T16:12:46 <Justin_o> once you have your new function, in your preview configuration you\'d replace the "onCreate.startLoadingContainer" listener that.templateLoader.transformUR with your new function name
2016-01-14T16:13:12 <Justin_o> e.g. listeners: {"onCreate.startLoadingContainer": "yourNewFuncName"}
2016-01-14T16:13:17 <Justin_o> zamcnema: ^
2016-01-14T16:19:08 <zamcnema> Justin_o: okay i\'ll give that a shot
2016-01-14T16:19:18 <Justin_o> zamcnema: okay, let me know how it goes

2016-01-14T16:29:29 <zamcnema> Justin_o: where would I put the function since I am calling it in as a gradeName?
2016-01-14T16:29:55 <zamcnema> Justin_o: excuse me, as a type
2016-01-14T16:30:03 <Justin_o> zamcnema: i\'m looking into something else actually, i just recently noticed that you did https://github.com/zamcnema/first-discovery-previewpane/blob/master/node_modules/gpii-first-discovery/src/js/firstDiscoveryEditor.js#L72
2016-01-14T16:30:27 <anastasiac> jhung: one more comment on your pull request. Other than that, it looks good
2016-01-14T16:31:44 <Justin_o> zamcnema:  the reference to "{that}.model.lang" won\'t work here because the preview doesn\'t have that value, and "{that}" in this case refers to the preview component. In fact it is the lang panel and enactor that have this value.
2016-01-14T16:32:16 <Justin_o> the prefsEditor also knows about the language but it\'s at a different model value that\'s based off the type from the schemas

2016-01-14T17:13:11 <Justin_o> zamcnema: from what you originally sent me with the expander using the fluid.stringTemplate, if you change "{that}.model.lang" to "{prefsEditor}.model.preferences.gpii_firstDiscovery_language" it should work
2016-01-14T17:13:51 <Justin_o> unfortunately it requires you to know the model value that the preference is stored at
