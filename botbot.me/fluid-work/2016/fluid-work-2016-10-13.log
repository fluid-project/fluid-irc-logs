2016-10-13T14:55:23 <gtirloni> Justin_o, it\'s working here

2016-10-13T15:25:49 <the-t-in-rtf> http://isitdownforjustme.appspot.com/?url=wikipedia.com
2016-10-13T15:26:39 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, sorry for the late hit, but I use sites like that when something like that comes up.
2016-10-13T15:27:47 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: thanks tony, i did use that and it said it was okay but wanted to double check.. i think it\'s a certificate issue. It won\'t open in chrome or safari for me, but does in Firefox
2016-10-13T15:28:17 <Justin_o> i get this in Chrome if "You cannot visit en.wikipedia.org right now because this certificate has been revoked. Network errors and attacks are usually temporary, so this page will probably work later."
2016-10-13T15:28:54 <Justin_o> so not sure if it\'s a Safari and Chrome thing only or it is also regional. Or perhaps something to do with the network I\'m on
2016-10-13T15:29:07 <the-t-in-rtf> I would suspect it might have been regional.
2016-10-13T15:29:40 <Justin_o> yah that would make sense
2016-10-13T15:29:44 <the-t-in-rtf> oh, weird.
2016-10-13T15:30:01 <the-t-in-rtf> looking at the cert, it accepts it, but I see errors when inspecting it in Chrome.
2016-10-13T15:30:18 <Justin_o> oh
2016-10-13T15:30:26 <Justin_o> that\'s strange
2016-10-13T15:30:39 <the-t-in-rtf> firefox seems happy with it.
2016-10-13T15:31:33 <Justin_o> I wonder why your chrome accepts it with the errors.. maybe it\'s getting a different error than mine?
2016-10-13T15:33:42 <the-t-in-rtf> I may simply have not updated Chrome as recently, I start work earlier than you folds
2016-10-13T15:33:44 <the-t-in-rtf> k
2016-10-13T15:33:53 <the-t-in-rtf> opening the "about" menu triggered an update.
2016-10-13T15:34:15 <the-t-in-rtf> looks like I\'m on 53.0.2785 for a few seconds more.
2016-10-13T15:34:25 <the-t-in-rtf> yup, up to that plus .143 now
2016-10-13T15:34:42 * gtirloni_ joined the channel
2016-10-13T15:35:16 <the-t-in-rtf> still works.
2016-10-13T15:36:45 <cindyli> gtirloni_: in terms of the "stack size exceeded" error, with your pull request https://github.com/idi-ops/ansible-nodejs/pull/34 making into the master, can I consider this issue https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2059 is fixed and close it
2016-10-13T15:39:01 <cindyli> let me know if there are pending conversations around this fix.
2016-10-13T15:49:14 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: i also had a chrome update, i think i\'m 54 now, but i\'m still having the issue. Am talking to avtar now about it too as it worked for him. He thinks it might have something to do with Mac OS X
2016-10-13T15:51:22 <the-t-in-rtf> I\'ve read a couple of SE articles about SSL cert caching on a given machine.
2016-10-13T16:07:09 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf, avtar: seems like some others are starting to have that issue too https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7707006
2016-10-13T16:11:06 <Justin_o> and twitter feed for the issue from globalsign https://twitter.com/globalsign/status/786505261842247680?lang=da
2016-10-13T16:12:49 <Justin_o> gtirloni_: just to keep you in the loop regarding wikipedia not working for me. ^
2016-10-13T16:13:47 <avtar> Justin_o: https://support.globalsign.com/customer/portal/articles/1353318-view-and-or-delete-crl-ocsp-cache
2016-10-13T16:13:52 <avtar> "mac users may still suffer"
2016-10-13T16:14:03 <avtar> https://twitter.com/globalsign/status/786569217784983552
2016-10-13T16:16:55 <Justin_o> avtar: i can confirm that I\'m still suffering
2016-10-13T16:17:27 <avtar> Justin_o: we all are in some way or the other
2016-10-13T16:17:41 <Justin_o> avtar: sad but true
2016-10-13T16:17:42 <avtar> globalsign, the pointer of truth
2016-10-13T16:22:36 <the-t-in-rtf> unless I need a valid cert to open a beer, I think the suffering is done for the day at least on this end.
2016-10-13T16:23:03 <the-t-in-rtf> good luck on that end.
