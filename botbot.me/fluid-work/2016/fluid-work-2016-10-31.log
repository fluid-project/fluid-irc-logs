2016-10-31T13:02:58 <the-t-in-rtf> There is no ouchDB meeting, just the id mgmt one.
2016-10-31T13:03:10 <the-t-in-rtf> It\'s at 15:00 CET, i.e. in one hour
2016-10-31T13:03:22 <the-t-in-rtf> we changed to winter time over the weekend
2016-10-31T13:04:36 <alanharnum> ah - we don\'t change over until this weekend, hence the desync

2016-10-31T14:03:05 <the-t-in-rtf1> Hi, All.  Just installing the Vidyo update and then starting my room.
2016-10-31T14:04:27 <the-t-in-rtf1> @colin @Bosmon @alanharnum @simonjb  ^^^
2016-10-31T14:06:52 <lliskovoi> ewbjr: colinclark could we push back the meeting to a bit later in the day, around 4pm? If this is at all inconvenient we can stick with 2pm, just have a couple of things to wrap up and could use a bit of extra time.
2016-10-31T14:07:24 <the-t-in-rtf1> @cindyli we are starting the meeting if you\'re available
2016-10-31T14:08:43 <ewbjr> lliskovoi: that works for me, I was able to get the API called connected last night, so some extra time would be nice on my end to :)
2016-10-31T14:12:31 <colinclark> ok, 4 pm is fine with me too
2016-10-31T14:12:55 <lliskovoi> thanks ewbjr colinclark, see you at 4 :)

2016-10-31T19:17:35 <cindyli> gtirloni: i noticed an issue with running "grunt tests" with universal vagrant, which makes me think the fix for GPII-2060 is probably not sufficient. the issue is that, if i don\'t do "vagrant destroy; vagrant up" in between two "grunt tests" run, this error will be thrown by running node tests at the second time: http://pastebin.com/PgGUFF5E
2016-10-31T19:18:16 <cindyli> to work around it, vagrant needs to be re-provisioned after each use for running node tests
2016-10-31T19:18:48 <cindyli> i can consistently reproduce the issue with my pull request: https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/464
2016-10-31T19:19:05 <cindyli> i\'m going to try the master as the next
2016-10-31T19:19:52 <Justin_o> simonjb: I\'ve addressed the comment you left and updated the PR https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/771
2016-10-31T19:20:20 <simonjb> thanks Justin_o, I till take a look and merge it in

2016-10-31T19:20:56 <gtirloni> cindyli: ELF error means the split node_modules change is not in place
2016-10-31T19:21:39 <cindyli> gtirloni: i ran "npm install" on my host machine before "vagrant up"
2016-10-31T19:22:00 <gtirloni> that\'s okay. vagrant up (with split node_modules) will shadow/hide those OSX files
2016-10-31T19:22:42 <gtirloni> cindyli: `vagrant ssh -c "mount | grep node_modules"` -- could you paste the result of that?
2016-10-31T19:22:43 <cindyli> gtirloni: let me check if I\'m using the idi-ansible master
2016-10-31T19:23:44 * stegru joined the channel
2016-10-31T19:23:51 <cindyli> gtirloni: i\'m running "vagrant up" with the master branch. i guess you\'d like me to run this command with my own branch where the problem happens, right
2016-10-31T19:25:08 <Justin_o> simonjb: thanks
2016-10-31T19:26:20 <cindyli> waiting for the "grunt tests" on master to finish. once this is done, i will switch back to my branch and do "npm install; vagrant up" then that command
2016-10-31T19:27:00 <gtirloni> cindyli: what you\'re describing could happen if you delete the node_modules directory from outside the VM.. that breaks the bind mount inside the VM. when cleaning the outside node_modules directory on OSX.. do a `rm -rf node_modules/*` so the original dir stays in place
2016-10-31T19:28:31 <cindyli> gtirloni: do you have some time to vidyo so i can share my screen
2016-10-31T19:30:05 <gtirloni> cindyli: yes, i\'m available now
2016-10-31T19:30:11 <cindyli> thanks
2016-10-31T19:30:54 <cindyli> gtirloni: r u off vidyo?
2016-10-31T19:31:03 <gtirloni> cindyli: just opened the client
2016-10-31T19:31:10 <cindyli> ok. thanks
2016-10-31T19:50:25 <Justin_o> simonjb: could you please see if you can reproduce this issue on a windows machine https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6012

2016-10-31T20:17:30 <cindyli> danayo: michelled wants to know for the guideline cards, how many cards for each type?
2016-10-31T20:18:15 * gtirloni joined the channel
2016-10-31T20:19:17 <cindyli> she and Justin is physically cutting out those cards
2016-10-31T20:19:32 <cindyli> paper cards
2016-10-31T20:19:38 <danayo> not sure what you mean cindyli - each type?
2016-10-31T20:19:43 <danayo> like each cateogory?
2016-10-31T20:19:59 <cindyli> yes
2016-10-31T20:20:16 <danayo> is she worried that some are missing?
2016-10-31T20:20:18 <danayo> cindyli?
2016-10-31T20:20:44 <danayo> i would just have to count them cindyli
2016-10-31T20:22:31 <cindyli> danayo: michelled said she has random number of cards in a random order. she\'s trying to organize
2016-10-31T20:25:01 <cindyli> danayo: i think we have a site for those cards. do you think if it would be useful for her to directly compare to that
2016-10-31T20:25:14 <cindyli> can you send me the link to that site if we do have one
2016-10-31T20:26:33 <danayo> cindyli: https://guide.inclusivedesign.ca/

2016-10-31T20:28:29 <cindyli> we cannot figure out how many cards for each category by looking at the site
