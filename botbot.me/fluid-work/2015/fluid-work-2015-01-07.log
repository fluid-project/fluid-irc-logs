2015-01-07T14:48:31 <Justin_o> colinclark, kasparnet, michelled: i have a question about priorities for the oauth2 ui\'s. Should i focus on getting keyboard a11y, aria, and unit tests in place for the selection tree, or prioritize getting the preferences selection working with the mouse, and come back to the rest afterwards.
2015-01-07T14:49:01 <Justin_o> i\'m sort of asking this question as I\'ve run into some complications with using fluid.selectable to try to get keyboard a11y for the selection tree
2015-01-07T14:49:21 <colinclark> one sec, Justin_o
2015-01-07T14:49:27 <colinclark> we\'re all in a planning meeting for the review
2015-01-07T14:49:38 <colinclark> but I\'ll give you some advice as soon as I get a sec
2015-01-07T14:49:40 <Justin_o> sure, and just to be clear this is specifically for the review
2015-01-07T14:49:44 <Justin_o> colinclark: thanks

2015-01-07T15:32:12 <simonjb> avtar: hey, where are we meeting?
2015-01-07T15:32:22 <kasparnet> Justin_o, colinclark, michelled: I\'d vote for preferences selection working with mouse if that\'s easier.. For the review meeting we\'ll risk flunking on not having that funcationlity ready
2015-01-07T15:32:24 <colinclark> still in our review planning meeting
2015-01-07T15:32:38 <colinclark> kasparnet: I agree
2015-01-07T15:32:54 <kasparnet> (in the longer term, we might flunk on lack of keyboard accessiblity, so we shouldn\'t forget about that
2015-01-07T15:32:57 <kasparnet> )*
2015-01-07T15:33:59 <avtar> simonjb: we can meet in my vidyo room
2015-01-07T15:36:23 <Justin_o> kasparnet, colinclark: thanks.. i can probably get a suboptimal keyboard experience working for now.. tabbing to everything. Instead of the more proper arrowing around interaction.
2015-01-07T15:36:34 <colinclark> we will be demoing security ourselves, rather than having the EC reviewers try it out
2015-01-07T15:36:37 <colinclark> so suboptimal is fine
2015-01-07T15:37:09 <kasparnet> yes
2015-01-07T15:38:04 <kasparnet> and wild cheering   \\o/    for talking about how well to get things working instead of whether we\'ll get things working :)
2015-01-07T15:38:15 <avtar> kasparnet: any idea when you\'ll be free to chat?
2015-01-07T15:38:24 <kasparnet> avtar: 3 minutes
2015-01-07T15:38:37 <avtar> ok

2015-01-07T15:40:51 <colinclark> be there soon
2015-01-07T15:43:20 <kasparnet> avtar: are we meeting in your room?
2015-01-07T15:43:25 <avtar> yup
2015-01-07T15:46:53 * kasparne_ joined the channel
2015-01-07T15:47:26 <kasparne_> getting server connection errors

2015-01-07T15:49:33 <anastasiac> yzen: Happy 30th birthday!
2015-01-07T15:49:39 <yzen> :) thanks
2015-01-07T15:49:51 <avtar> kasparne_: is the vidyo desktop client generating that error or your browser?
2015-01-07T15:49:57 <anastasiac> big celebrations planned, yzen?
2015-01-07T15:49:59 <avtar> yzen: happy birthday :D
2015-01-07T15:50:00 <kasparne_> desktop client
2015-01-07T15:50:10 <yzen> avtar thanks
2015-01-07T15:50:14 <kasparne_> hey man - happy birthday yzen\'ovich
2015-01-07T15:50:19 <yzen> anastasiac very low key :)
2015-01-07T15:50:23 <anastasiac> :-)
2015-01-07T15:50:27 <Bosmon> Happy birthday ZENE\'EVICH : P
2015-01-07T15:50:34 <yzen> Bosmon thanks
2015-01-07T15:51:15 <avtar> kasparne_: alfredo, simon, and i have been chatting in that vidyo room but we can switch to skype instead
2015-01-07T15:51:31 <kasparne_> avtar: ok - so it complains if I modify the password to something wrong
2015-01-07T15:51:46 <kasparne_> but if I put the correct passwrod it complains about connectivity issues
2015-01-07T15:52:22 <colinclark> where are we meeting?
2015-01-07T15:52:37 <kasparne_> I can try the web client (if one such exist)
2015-01-07T15:53:13 <kasparne_> ok, reinstalling
2015-01-07T15:54:07 <simonjb> colinclark: avatar\'s vidyo room

2015-01-07T16:19:39 <Bosmon> slim_jim - JAWS accepts INI files
2015-01-07T16:20:20 <slim_jim> Bosmon: thanks - yes cunningly disguised :)
2015-01-07T16:20:40 <slim_jim> I thought you knocked up an example in a workshop?
