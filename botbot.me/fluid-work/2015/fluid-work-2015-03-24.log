2015-03-24T11:39:09 <Justin_o> Bosmon: hello, are you available for a few questions?
2015-03-24T11:48:56 <Bosmon> Sure, Justin_o
2015-03-24T11:49:00 <Bosmon> Isn\'t it the middle of the night? : P
2015-03-24T11:50:13 <Justin_o> Bosmon: haha, it\'s about 7:50 am here. I started at around 6:50am because i\'m working from home today :)
2015-03-24T11:51:18 <Justin_o> Bosmon: so i was looking into http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5606 because I\'m trying to update the Infusion in the first discovery tool and found that things were breaking because the tooltip component wasn\'t a relay component ( there seems to be more to it than just this, but that was at least part of the problem).
2015-03-24T11:52:04 <Justin_o> so i found that there are some TODO\'s in the tooltip component, but i\'m not exactly sure what the fixes for them are and if they need to be done with this update. I filed another jira that could use some elaboration
2015-03-24T11:52:12 <Justin_o> http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5607
2015-03-24T11:53:01 <Justin_o> Bosmon: here are my current changes related to FLUID-5606 https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/compare/master...jobara:FLUID-5606
2015-03-24T11:53:42 * kasparnet has quit
2015-03-24T11:54:09 <Justin_o> this seems to be enough to get it to be a relay component although I\'m finding that i have to use excludeSource: "init" in several places in the first discovery tool now and manually call the related listener handler with on onCreate event. This is because the tooltip isn\'t ready yet when the modelListener is called during the init process
2015-03-24T11:54:46 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, that happens a lot for the time being
2015-03-24T11:54:56 <Bosmon> We\'ll be able to fix it once we have the async ginger world
2015-03-24T11:55:12 <Bosmon> Manually calling the listener handler should be unnecessary though
2015-03-24T11:55:42 <Bosmon> Well, perhaps it is :(
2015-03-24T11:57:31 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay.. i\'ll keep going as is for that.. do my changes for FLUID-5606 look okay and would you be able to properly describe what\'s needed for FLUID-5607?
2015-03-24T11:58:22 <Bosmon> I think simply removing the if statement on line 31 is the most we can do for now
2015-03-24T12:01:05 <Bosmon> I\'m not quite sure what the comment on line 203 was imagining
2015-03-24T12:02:43 <Bosmon> You could update the comment to read something like "we could consider a more fine-grained scheme for this, listening to content and idToContent separately"
2015-03-24T12:04:20 * kasparnet joined the channel
2015-03-24T12:09:37 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay... thanks.. would you like those done as part of FLUID-5607 or FLUID-5606?
2015-03-24T12:10:01 <Justin_o> Bosmon: I was planning on putting off the FLUID-5607 work, but the FLUID-5606 i\'ll need to get in soon.

2015-03-24T12:30:08 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I think removing the if statement and updating the comment may as well be done immediately : P
2015-03-24T12:35:30 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yah, i was thinking the same thing.. should be small enough anyways..
2015-03-24T12:36:57 <Justin_o> Bosmon: also if you didn\'t see, cindyli and I put up some pull requests for you to look at regarding those updates to the prefs Framework we talked about when you were in Toronto

2015-03-24T14:02:41 <Justin_o> michelled: that should work for me. I have to leave around 1:20 though, but i think that should be long enough
2015-03-24T14:03:05 <michelled> ok, let\'s do that - anastasiac, cindyli, jhung: 12:30 for Floe planning today
2015-03-24T14:03:27 <anastasiac> works for me, michelled
2015-03-24T14:03:28 <cindyli> sure
2015-03-24T14:05:24 <anastasiac> michelled, are you coming in to the office, or joining the floe meeting from home?
2015-03-24T14:05:39 <michelled> I\'ll have to join from home - I\'m in meetings until 12:30
