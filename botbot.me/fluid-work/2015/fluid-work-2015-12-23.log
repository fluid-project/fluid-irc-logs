b'2015-12-23T18:25:22 <colinclark> avtar: I\'ve got to say...
2015-12-23T18:25:31 <colinclark> this is going to make reviewing GPII code SO MUCH EASIER
2015-12-23T18:25:33 <colinclark> thank you so much
2015-12-23T18:26:06 <avtar> :)
2015-12-23T18:26:29 <colinclark> avtar: I just made one comment on the pull request
2015-12-23T18:26:43 <colinclark> I guess it ultimately has to do with clarifying the expression "in your terminal"
2015-12-23T18:26:50 <colinclark> which I know realize means on the host
2015-12-23T18:27:01 <colinclark> Are you cool with adding something just to clarify this
2015-12-23T18:27:04 <colinclark> ?
2015-12-23T18:27:06 <avtar> sure
2015-12-23T18:27:07 <avtar> one sec
2015-12-23T18:27:18 <colinclark> Also, is there an equivalent command I can run on the universal image from the host?
2015-12-23T18:27:28 <colinclark> I realize I asked this question earlier, and perhaps I didn\'t fully understand
2015-12-23T18:28:06 <avtar> to be honest i\'m not sure why i didn\'t add grunt tasks as part of the universal changes
2015-12-23T18:28:37 <colinclark> sounds like an awesome new feature, avtar
2015-12-23T18:32:12 <colinclark> I\'m so excited about this new vagrant GPII provisioner
2015-12-23T18:32:52 <colinclark> I just keep running "grunt tests" over and over again
2015-12-23T18:33:03 <colinclark> except I type "grunt test" and then get an error, so then I type "grunt tests"
2015-12-23T18:33:19 <colinclark> they run so fast
2015-12-23T18:33:38 <colinclark> so michelled, in your long term plan, are you going to ditch Grunt entirely for Infusion?
2015-12-23T18:36:54 <michelled> yes, colinclark. but we aren\'t sure yet what we\'ll replace it with
2015-12-23T18:37:08 <colinclark> I guess npm scripts or maybe gulp?
2015-12-23T18:37:15 <colinclark> or some magical browserify stuff
2015-12-23T18:37:22 <michelled> likely the former
2015-12-23T18:37:37 <colinclark> cool
2015-12-23T18:37:37 <michelled> however, it will be interesting to see where gulp is when we are ready to tackle this

2015-12-23T18:44:50 <colinclark> build systems I think are starting to consolidate a bit in the JavaScript world
2015-12-23T18:50:16 <avtar> colinclark: i updated the gpii/linux pr
2015-12-23T18:50:39 <avtar> thanks for merging the universal one :D
2015-12-23T18:51:40 <colinclark> awesome
2015-12-23T18:51:44 <colinclark> i\'m going to merge this one, too!

2015-12-23T18:53:56 <colinclark> hahaha
2015-12-23T19:00:03 <michelled> I feel so uncomfortable. The stuff I did yesterday that *did not work* works today. The same change. but the thing is, is should have worked - I was pretty surprised yesterday that it wasn\'t and spent a lot of time confirming that it wasn\'t.
2015-12-23T19:00:24 <michelled> wow, that was so out of context in the channel :)
2015-12-23T19:00:38 <michelled> at least everyone who was at stand up know kind of what I\'m referring to

2015-12-23T19:08:31 <colinclark> it is a very poetic channel post :)
2015-12-23T19:10:15 <avtar> colinclark: if you get the chance could you please take a look at this pr as well? https://github.com/GPII/ci-service/pull/1
2015-12-23T19:10:22 <colinclark> yup
2015-12-23T19:10:30 <avtar> thanks
2015-12-23T19:11:59 <colinclark> I guess there\'s no easy way for me to test this, right, avtar?
2015-12-23T19:12:06 <avtar> no :/
2015-12-23T19:12:09 <colinclark> ok
2015-12-23T19:13:01 <colinclark> +1 on the documentation updates in this PR, avtar

2015-12-23T15:47:28 <michelled> they are *very* tasty :)
2015-12-23T15:47:34 <amatas> alanharnum, I\'d like to be in the IDRC office in moments like this
2015-12-23T15:49:20 <michelled> amatas: it\'s even warm today - above freezing :)
2015-12-23T15:50:24 <amatas> :D

2015-12-23T16:02:21 <colinclark> hey avtar
2015-12-23T16:02:24 <colinclark> how\'s it going?
2015-12-23T16:18:10 <avtar> colinclark: it\'s going well
2015-12-23T16:18:14 <avtar> yourself?
2015-12-23T16:18:52 <colinclark> Pretty good
2015-12-23T16:19:13 <colinclark> Still got a bit of Christmas shopping to do, which worries me
2015-12-23T16:19:24 <colinclark> so I figure I\'ll be doing a bit more work tomorrow, too :)
2015-12-23T16:19:34 <colinclark> I worked on your pull requests last night, though
2015-12-23T16:19:43 <avtar> awesome :D
2015-12-23T16:22:10 <colinclark> I wonder if you can tell me what shoud happen when I run "vagrant up" on the universal repository?
2015-12-23T16:22:24 <colinclark> What should I see? And do I need to do anything to make the testem tests run or anything?
2015-12-23T16:24:00 <avtar> it should download the fedora 22 box. once a vm is created using that box you should see fedora booting up. in your terminal you should see the vagrant progess followed by ansible provisioning the vm
2015-12-23T16:25:47 <avtar> regarding the tests, this is what jenkins runs https://github.com/avtar/ci-service/blob/GPII-1508/jenkins_jobs/universal.yml#L71
2015-12-23T16:26:17 <avtar> additionally the commands on lines 79 and 87 as well
2015-12-23T16:31:57 <colinclark> So from my perspective, I should see the VM pop up and that\'s about it?
2015-12-23T16:32:05 <colinclark> The tests don\'t run automatically--they\'re run by Jenkins?
2015-12-23T16:34:25 <colinclark> So for the purposes of functional testing, I should just see the box be provisioned and started
2015-12-23T16:34:25 <avtar> colinclark: yes
2015-12-23T16:34:29 <colinclark> ok
2015-12-23T16:34:55 <colinclark> One code question...
2015-12-23T16:34:56 <colinclark> https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/426/files#diff-23b6f443c01ea2efcb4f36eedfea9089R73
2015-12-23T16:35:08 <colinclark> This commented-out code; does it need to be there, or should it be deleted?
2015-12-23T16:36:21 <colinclark> avtar: ^
2015-12-23T16:42:59 <avtar> colinclark: it was included to provide a reason for why the service is getting restarted
2015-12-23T16:43:22 <colinclark> I\'m not sure I know what that means :)
2015-12-23T16:43:36 <avtar> you know what? neither do i :(
2015-12-23T16:44:19 <avtar> systemd doesn\'t provide a mechanism for sending notifications
2015-12-23T16:44:30 <avtar> other init replacements like upstart do
2015-12-23T16:45:50 <avtar> in a vagrant context we just want to know when the shared filesystem is available
2015-12-23T16:47:11 <colinclark> I guess the question is, does someone need to ever run those commands?
2015-12-23T16:47:12 <avtar> it\'s commented out right now because we aren\'t starting a nodejs process for universal
2015-12-23T16:47:38 <colinclark> In general, we tend to avoid leaving commented-out code in the system unless there\'s a really crucial reason
2015-12-23T16:47:47 <avtar> gotcha
2015-12-23T16:47:50 <colinclark> and if so, we typically file a JIRA about the issue and make sure there are comments around it
2015-12-23T16:48:03 <colinclark> but my impression is that if it\'s just there for future support, I\'d remove it
2015-12-23T16:48:09 <colinclark> tuck it away in your favourite text editor
2015-12-23T16:48:14 <colinclark> and put it back when you need it
2015-12-23T16:48:27 <avtar> sounds good, i\'ll update my pr
2015-12-23T16:48:28 <colinclark> minor details, but it does help to make the code navigable and intention clear within it
2015-12-23T16:48:30 <colinclark> ok cool
2015-12-23T16:48:34 <colinclark> and then I will merge it :)
2015-12-23T16:48:48 <avtar> i\'m a fan of minor details
2015-12-23T16:48:52 <colinclark> :) :)
2015-12-23T16:49:01 <colinclark> I\'ll put a quick comment on the pull request, just so this conversation is documented.
2015-12-23T16:52:27 <colinclark> Justin_o: I _think_ Bosmon2 is travelling up to the Lake District today
2015-12-23T16:52:39 <colinclark> so he might not be around to look at your pull request until after you\'ve left for the holiday
2015-12-23T16:52:56 <colinclark> but I don\'t know for sure
2015-12-23T17:01:03 <avtar> colinclark: the comments have been removed
2015-12-23T17:01:20 <colinclark> awesome, thanks
2015-12-23T17:01:25 <colinclark> I\'ll push it in a minute
2015-12-23T17:15:18 * alanharnum has quit
2015-12-23T17:16:01 <jhung> colinclark: I was wondering if we can kick up that conversation about having a 2nd version of John Travoltage sim.
2015-12-23T17:22:21 <jhung> Justin_o - can you make a gh-pages version of the John Travoltage sim?
2015-12-23T17:22:41 <Justin_o> i could i guess, i haven\'t pushed up all the code yet though
2015-12-23T17:22:47 <Justin_o> but i could do that today
2015-12-23T17:23:41 <colinclark> jhung: sure, let\'s rock it
2015-12-23T17:25:00 <jhung> colinclark: so I was thinking we should have two versions of the JT sim. One with all the bells and whistles (and a11y features added), and one which is an HTML representation of the sim.
2015-12-23T17:25:20 <colinclark> ok
2015-12-23T17:25:28 <colinclark> So what does it mean to have two versions, do you think?
2015-12-23T17:25:43 <colinclark> What\'s the relationship between the versions?
2015-12-23T17:26:06 <jhung> Sure, let me see if I can explain what I envision...
2015-12-23T17:27:24 <jhung> The HTML version would be a representation of what would be in the parallel DOM of the "full" version. It would have all the descriptions, sliders, etc. It could have other additional features such as a static image showing what the setting looks like, as well as UIO integrated.
2015-12-23T17:28:06 <jhung> We could even use what we know about metadata and give it information that will help with content matching.
2015-12-23T17:29:22 <Justin_o> jhung: http://jobara.github.io/john-travoltage-html/
2015-12-23T17:30:01 <jhung> perfect Justin_o. colinclark you can check out that url for the current implementation
2015-12-23T17:30:16 * Yan_Hu has left the channel
2015-12-23T17:30:58 <Justin_o> colinclark, jhung: the javascript is quite rough though... just working through the ideas still
2015-12-23T17:31:05 <colinclark> So will there be any relationship between the two versions?
2015-12-23T17:33:21 <jhung> I would hope so colinclark. I imagine the HTML version would somehow be used by PhET scenery to generate the parallel DOM.
2015-12-23T17:33:33 <colinclark> In what way, jhung?
2015-12-23T17:34:47 <jhung> From what I understand, phet uses a MVC scheme for their sims. We would have a single model and two views. Exactly how that\'d be done I\'m not quite sure. Perhaps Justin_o can help me out here.
2015-12-23T17:35:39 <colinclark> ok
2015-12-23T17:36:07 <colinclark> So Scenery has the ability to generate HTML "peers" for views it draws into a canvas
2015-12-23T17:36:22 <colinclark> It\'s a scene graph library
2015-12-23T17:36:39 <colinclark> so the idea is that it manages an object model that represents the states of all views drawn on screen
2015-12-23T17:37:45 <colinclark> and part of the work Jon Olson has been doing over the past while is to add support, as you probably know, for managing HTML "shadow DOM" as part of the scene graph\'s state
2015-12-23T17:38:14 <colinclark> So how does your idea relate to this?
2015-12-23T17:38:37 <colinclark> Is the idea that there would be some kind of mode where you could turn off the Canvas rendering of the scene graph and only render the HTML "peers?"
2015-12-23T17:39:00 <colinclark> Or are you envisioning a separate application of some kind?
2015-12-23T17:40:55 <jhung> originally I was thinking of a separate application - just an HTML file which can used and embedded much like the current sim HTML files. Switching view modes / peers is an excellent idea too which could be very useful.
2015-12-23T17:41:42 <colinclark> What\'s the advantage of the approach, do you think, jhung?
2015-12-23T17:42:07 <jhung> Which approach are you referring to colinclark?
2015-12-23T17:42:25 <colinclark> your idea of an HTML-only version
2015-12-23T17:43:29 <jhung> I\'m thinking content malleability and the ability to run on platforms that is less suited for an interactive sim (thinking e-ink EPUB platforms).
2015-12-23T17:45:32 <colinclark> Can you elaborate on the point about content malleability?
2015-12-23T17:49:12 <jhung> We would be able to perform transformations on the content similar to what we\'ve been doing in FLOE. That would be something that wouldn\'t be possible with the existing sim because all of the DOM information is visually hiddden.
2015-12-23T17:49:22 * michelled joined the channel
2015-12-23T17:49:50 * alanharnum joined the channel
2015-12-23T17:52:33 <colinclark> jhung: The thing to thinnk about, when we consider different "versions" of an application, is how to avoid the old problem of the "text only version"
2015-12-23T17:52:43 <colinclark> which really plagued the web in the early days
2015-12-23T17:53:07 <colinclark> so whatever this "version" is, you\'d want it to be integrally connected to the mainline of the sim
2015-12-23T17:53:13 <colinclark> rather than being a fork or a separate version
2015-12-23T17:53:46 <jhung> Fair point colinclark. I see it as one and the same. One with top-hat and tails, and one in sweats and bunny slippers.
2015-12-23T17:54:34 <Justin_o> alanharnum: did you try any of these endpoints https://wiki.gpii.net/w/Flow_Manager_API
2015-12-23T17:54:37 <Justin_o> for the flow manager
2015-12-23T17:55:38 <alanharnum> Justin_o: yeah - to be clear, the endpoints work, I just can\'t figure out which combination of OS + solution I need to use to see any of the set preferences, or if that\'s possible
2015-12-23T17:55:56 <jhung> I think whatever we do, we should do it in a way that makes it easy to maintain and integrates nicely with the existing sim. Maybe it\'ll just be the full sim but with a parameter to turn off the visuals.
2015-12-23T17:56:04 <Justin_o> alanharnum: you mean to enact the preferences on a GPII enabled machine?
2015-12-23T17:56:40 <alanharnum> Justin_o: to retrieve the preferences that would be relevant to a solution, yeah
2015-12-23T17:57:06 <colinclark> jhung: I can see that being a possibility, yes
2015-12-23T17:57:20 <colinclark> perhaps with some nice UIO-like personalization options for the simulation
2015-12-23T17:57:44 <colinclark> my impression, in regards to content malleability, is that we really need to pursue personalization of the visual presentation, too
2015-12-23T17:58:03 <colinclark> working to make high contrast, large-print versions of the sim, for example
2015-12-23T17:58:21 <colinclark> and that these personalizations should be under the control of the learner
2015-12-23T17:58:43 <colinclark> In the end, a text-only version can be helpful in some cases, perhaps like the e-ink example that you mentioned
2015-12-23T17:58:51 <jhung> colinclark: should we try to bring some of that into this round of PhET work, or do you think it\'s something for a later time?
2015-12-23T17:58:57 <colinclark> but there are so many really interesting use cases we don\'t want to lose sight of
2015-12-23T17:59:05 <jhung> re: graphic customization
2015-12-23T17:59:28 <colinclark> such as students with low vision collaborating with their peers who don\'t need visual alternatives
2015-12-23T18:00:09 <colinclark> jhung: We should definitely work with PhET to design and implement personalization, including support for different ways of making a sim easier to see and use
2015-12-23T18:00:30 <colinclark> Scenery may not yet be ready for it, but our designs can help set the future direction
2015-12-23T18:02:56 <jhung> colinclark: got it. Thanks for the feedback. I\'ll work on this idea some more.
2015-12-23T18:03:06 <colinclark> sounds awesome, jhung
2015-12-23T18:03:18 <colinclark> happy to chat any time about it
2015-12-23T18:20:40 <colinclark> avtar: Similar question for the Linux Vagrant provisioning...
2015-12-23T18:20:58 <colinclark> When I am finished running "vagrant up," should I see anything happen, or should any tests run automatically?
2015-12-23T18:21:10 <avtar> they don\'t run automatically
2015-12-23T18:22:29 <colinclark> can I run them?
2015-12-23T18:22:57 <colinclark> I see instructions on the new grunt tasks
2015-12-23T18:23:07 <colinclark> but being a Dinosaur Developer, I\'m just slightly confused
2015-12-23T18:23:12 <colinclark> Do I run the commands from the VM?
2015-12-23T18:24:15 <avtar> yup you can use \'grunt unit-tests\' and/or \'grunt acceptance-tests\'
2015-12-23T18:24:29 <colinclark> looks like I run them from my host, though, right?
2015-12-23T18:24:29 <avtar> on your host
2015-12-23T18:24:33 <colinclark> got it
2015-12-23T18:24:35 <colinclark> this rules
