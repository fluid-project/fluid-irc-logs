2015-10-23T14:49:42 <simonjb> hey Bosmon: can I get your advice on something? We would like to change our configs so that the untrusted flow manager runs on 8081. I currently have https://github.com/simonbates/universal/blob/GPII-1224/gpii/configs/untrusted.json which I will change to 8081. But we also have https://github.com/simonbates/universal/blob/GPII-1224/gpii/configs/cloudBased.development.all.local.json -- should I leave this as is and change the cloudBased
2015-10-23T14:49:43 <simonjb> port in the combined only? Or change the port in the cloudBased config?
2015-10-23T14:56:21 <Bosmon> simonjb - I guess it would be helpful if all of the various development configs ended up producing the same overall port for the endpoint that the user users
2015-10-23T14:56:28 <Bosmon> So we could have a uniform set of instructions on how to test them
2015-10-23T14:56:47 <Bosmon> So I imagine you can put a few "distributeOptions" definitions in your "glue" config to adjust these if necessary
2015-10-23T14:58:11 <simonjb> Bosmon: yep, that\'s reasonable, thanks -- I\'ll make the configs both use 8081 and then in the "glue" config, change the cloudBased port
2015-10-23T14:58:40 <Bosmon> simonjb - awesome, thanks

2015-10-23T17:38:00 <anastasiac> cindyli, if you have some time this afternoon, would you be able to review this page? http://acheetham.github.io/docs-first-discovery/serverConfig.html I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve got all the facts straight, but it would be good to know if I missed anything, or made a bad recommendation, and also whether or not you think it\xe2\x80\x99s clearly explained.
2015-10-23T17:47:24 <cindyli> sure. thanks, anastasiac
2015-10-23T17:52:41 <cindyli> anastasiac: the new tutorial looks great
2015-10-23T17:52:54 <anastasiac> oh, good :-)
2015-10-23T17:55:14 <anastasiac> cindyli: cae you see the jira issues displayed properly on the iteration page? it looks broken to me

2015-10-23T18:00:15 <cindyli> system upgrade?
2015-10-23T18:00:25 <anastasiac> thanks for checking. I\xe2\x80\x99ve pinged gjo
2015-10-23T18:17:05 <gtirloni> cindyli: yesterday\'s security patch reset the list of tls/ssl certificates that confluence knew about. i had to restore the original and it seems to be working now.
2015-10-23T18:17:22 <gtirloni> anastasiac cindyli: thanks for reporting that error!
2015-10-23T18:18:53 <cindyli> thanks, gtirloni
2015-10-23T18:42:51 <simonjb> hey Bosmon, do you have any time to chat with me about our dynamic grade kettle config building?
2015-10-23T18:43:33 <Bosmon> simonjb - sure
2015-10-23T18:44:11 <simonjb> Bosmon: awesome, what was the name of the shared code editor we used before?

2015-10-23T18:55:10 <Bosmon> simonjb - I forgot
2015-10-23T18:55:35 <anastasiac> thanks for the heads-up gtirloni, I\xe2\x80\x99m good (not editing right now)
2015-10-23T18:56:00 <cindyli> gtirloni: i\'m good too
2015-10-23T18:56:12 <simonjb> Bosmon: found it! http://collabedit.com/gusfp
2015-10-23T18:56:45 <simonjb> Bosmon: can we do vidyo also?
2015-10-23T18:58:56 <gtirloni> anastasiac cindyli: i\'m not seeing the errors anymore
2015-10-23T18:59:27 <cindyli> gtirloni: yes, links are back. thanks!
2015-10-23T18:59:58 <anastasiac> gtirloni: I\xe2\x80\x99m not seeing the problems I saw before, either. Thanks!

2015-10-23T20:18:11 <Bosmon> colinclark - yes
2015-10-23T20:18:13 <colinclark> I think once this marvellous new pull request is merged, I will go ahead and try it for the first time
2015-10-23T20:18:34 <Bosmon> It is relatively simple
2015-10-23T20:18:39 <Bosmon> You can, miraculously, type this:
2015-10-23T20:18:44 <Bosmon> npm install -g fluid-publish
2015-10-23T20:18:55 <Bosmon> And then.... from the thing you want to release... type
2015-10-23T20:18:58 <Bosmon> fluid-publish!
2015-10-23T20:19:09 <colinclark> ha!
2015-10-23T20:19:11 <colinclark> incredible
2015-10-23T20:19:16 <Bosmon> (minus the exclamation mark, clearly)
2015-10-23T20:19:32 <colinclark> if Justin_o were here, I\'d tell him how awesome this is
2015-10-23T20:20:04 <colinclark> [o__o]: Let it be stated, for the record, that Justin_o\'s fluid-publish micromodule is awesome :)

2015-10-23T21:47:27 <Bosmon> simonjb - that\'s absolutely fantastic!!
2015-10-23T21:52:31 <simonjb> yeah, thanks for all your help Bosmon
2015-10-23T21:52:57 <simonjb> the config we sketched together basically worked as is
2015-10-23T21:53:21 <simonjb> once I put the builder in place to construct the new grade
