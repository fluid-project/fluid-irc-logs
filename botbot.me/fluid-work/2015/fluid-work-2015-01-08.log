b'2015-01-08T19:53:43 <simonjb> so, if a user posted a decision without a selectedPreferences input, is that select all or select nothing?
2015-01-08T19:53:53 <simonjb> I wonder if maybe select all?
2015-01-08T19:54:36 <simonjb> I don\'t want to spend a huge amount of time on this as it really is a inbetween work-in-progress state but we do need to do something
2015-01-08T19:55:31 <simonjb> Justin_o and Bosmon: both your selections UI and your filtering code both handle {} and {"": true} as select nothing and select all respectively?
2015-01-08T19:56:31 <Bosmon> simonjb - yes
2015-01-08T19:56:35 <Justin_o> simonjb: you know in all this i realized i forgot to transform the model before saving it to the input.. so i have to go fix that.. sorry
2015-01-08T19:56:54 <simonjb> Bosmon: what about undefined? do you currently handle that?
2015-01-08T19:56:55 <Justin_o> simonjb: yes.. that\'s correct
2015-01-08T19:57:16 <Bosmon> simonjb - the code isn\'t written yet, but I wasn\'t planning to handle that
2015-01-08T19:57:22 <Bosmon> It can\'t be transmitted as JSON in any case
2015-01-08T19:57:54 <simonjb> Bosmon: ok, cool, I will ensure that authDecisions always have a selectedPreferences with a non-undefined value
2015-01-08T19:58:03 <Bosmon> Cheers!
2015-01-08T19:58:29 <simonjb> I will handle the undefined POST case and map it to one of those 2 binary cases
2015-01-08T19:59:04 <simonjb> Justin_o, Bosmon, cindyli1: thanks all
2015-01-08T20:02:29 <Justin_o> simonjb, Bosmon, cindyli1: I just updated my branch with the authorization setting the servers format of the model to the hidden input

2015-01-08T23:25:58 <avtar> Bosmon, colinclark: ping
2015-01-08T23:26:44 <Bosmon> Hi avtar
2015-01-08T23:28:11 <colinclark> heya
2015-01-08T23:28:29 <avtar> docker has an option that allows tagging or specifying version info for images https://docs.docker.com/reference/commandline/cli/#build doing so allows you to differentiate images based on how they were built https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/node/
2015-01-08T23:28:59 <avtar> i\'m creating an image for the universal repo that will get built whenever changes are merged
2015-01-08T23:29:37 <avtar> i have a question related to versioning these builds/images
2015-01-08T23:30:41 <avtar> i could follow semantic versioning but that might be fairly arbitrary since the universal repo doesn\'t appear to do the same
2015-01-08T23:31:01 <colinclark> We\'ve only ever cut one release of the GPII
2015-01-08T23:31:11 <colinclark> In this post-release era
2015-01-08T23:31:23 <avtar> would it be okay if we used timestamps YYYYMMDDHHMM for universal images?
2015-01-08T23:31:37 <colinclark> I don\'t see any reason why not
2015-01-08T23:31:46 <colinclark> It\'s more or less the strategy I used for years with Flocking
2015-01-08T23:31:52 <avtar> poiiifect
2015-01-08T23:31:53 <avtar> thanks
2015-01-08T23:32:01 <colinclark> I can tell when users have an old version by checking the date at the top of a built version of it :P
2015-01-08T23:32:08 <colinclark> it\'s pretty neanderthal
2015-01-08T23:32:22 <colinclark> in our case for the GPII, I can\'t think of anything more appropriate
2015-01-08T23:32:43 <colinclark> presumably as our daily build infrastructure grows, we\'ll build docker containers every day from the source anyway, right?
2015-01-08T23:32:59 <avtar> yes
2015-01-08T23:33:14 <avtar> and whenever dependencies deem it necessary
2015-01-08T23:33:35 <avtar> like node upgrades or shellshocks
2015-01-08T23:34:21 <colinclark> cool
2015-01-08T23:34:25 <colinclark> that seems reasonable
2015-01-08T23:34:36 <colinclark> A dumb question...
2015-01-08T23:34:51 <colinclark> There is a Docker runtime for Mac OS X, right?
2015-01-08T23:35:05 <colinclark> meaning I could take one of these hypothetical daily built Docker containers
2015-01-08T23:35:10 <colinclark> and fire it up directly on my Mac?
2015-01-08T23:35:29 <colinclark> relatively simulating what life would be like on the server?
2015-01-08T23:35:46 <avtar> somewhat directly
2015-01-08T23:35:54 <colinclark> how does it work?
2015-01-08T23:36:00 <avtar> they advocate the use of a vm https://docs.docker.com/installation/mac/
2015-01-08T23:36:01 <colinclark> Does it use Vagrant behind the scenes?
2015-01-08T23:36:07 <colinclark> ah
2015-01-08T23:36:35 <colinclark> So Boot2Docker is just a preconfigured VirtualBox instance
2015-01-08T23:36:59 <colinclark> Looks like there\'s a windows version now
2015-01-08T23:38:22 <avtar> i wonder if we should just use vagrant instead
2015-01-08T23:38:33 <colinclark> instead of B2D?
2015-01-08T23:38:48 <avtar> since a centos vagrant box would be closer to simulating life on the server
2015-01-08T23:38:49 <avtar> yup
2015-01-08T23:39:09 <colinclark> but it has a cool name!
2015-01-08T23:40:04 <avtar> that much is true :P

2015-01-08T15:20:49 <Justin_o> simonjb: sure
2015-01-08T15:21:45 <cindyli> Justin_o: i\'m using relay components for the model relay btw the privacy settings page and its edit dialog. Do you think it\'s ok that we make gpii.oauth2.selectionTree a rendererRelayComponent?
2015-01-08T15:22:36 <Justin_o> I think that should be fine, but we\'ll also have to change the authorization to be too..
2015-01-08T15:22:48 <Justin_o> would you like me to make the change in my branch and then you can merge that into yours
2015-01-08T15:23:01 <Justin_o> cindyli: do you have a minute for a chat?

2015-01-08T15:39:31 <Justin_o> cindyli: i\'ve updated my GPII-1051 branch. The selection tree is a rendererRelayComponent now and one of the styling issues is also fixed
2015-01-08T15:39:45 <cindyli> thanks, Justin_o. merging ..
2015-01-08T15:40:01 <Justin_o> cindyli: also the docs i was mentioning are here https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/blob/master/src/documents/ComponentGrades.md and https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/blob/master/src/documents/ModelRelay.md

2015-01-08T16:11:02 <Justin_o> simonjb, cindyli: Fixed the DOM Event issue. Forgot I was using the renderer in the parent, so just used a createOnEvent set to "afterRender" for the subcomponent. That\'s all working, but came across another styling issue where the indeterminate state for the checkboxes looks bad.
2015-01-08T16:11:43 <cindyli> cool. thanks, Justin_o
2015-01-08T16:20:57 <Justin_o> simonjb, cindyli: I have the functionality of the authorization page with the selection tree working. there are a couple of styling issues left and there should be some more work down to fetch the available prefs and template of the selection tree. You can see what\'s working here. https://github.com/jobara/universal/tree/GPII-1033
2015-01-08T16:21:34 <cindyli> a super good example for my privacy page ;) thanks, Justin_o
2015-01-08T16:21:44 <simonjb> awesome, thanks Justin_o
2015-01-08T16:22:21 <simonjb> Justin_o: does this include sending the selectedPreferences input?
2015-01-08T16:22:24 <Justin_o> cindyli: i also made a change to the gpii-oauth2.css so that the panels are white and you can add panels inside of them that are grey https://github.com/jobara/universal/blob/GPII-1033/gpii/node_modules/gpii-oauth2/gpii-oauth2-authz-server/public/src/shared/css/gpii-oauth2.css#L57-L64
2015-01-08T16:22:49 <cindyli> cool. thanks, Justin_o
2015-01-08T16:23:05 <Justin_o> simonjb: yes, the selection model is added to the selectedPreferences hidden input

2015-01-08T19:21:14 <Bosmon> This is your and cindyli1\'s main working branch, right? https://github.com/jobara/universal/blob/GPII-1033/gpii/node_modules/gpii-oauth2/gpii-oauth2-authz-server/views/privacySettings.handlebars

2015-01-08T19:22:00 <Bosmon> ah ok
2015-01-08T19:22:13 <Justin_o> Bosmon: but 1033 has my latest work
2015-01-08T19:22:22 <Bosmon> Do you have your markup for the selection tree yet? Or does it exist only in tests?
2015-01-08T19:22:56 <Justin_o> it\'s in the authorization page now too. it will be moved later to a template file probably
2015-01-08T19:23:05 <Justin_o> and there a couple of styling bugs i have to knock off too
2015-01-08T19:23:07 <Bosmon> Ah great, see it now
2015-01-08T19:23:08 <Bosmon> Thanks
2015-01-08T19:23:23 <Justin_o> Bosmon: cool.. let me know if you have any questions or comments

2015-01-08T19:43:38 <Justin_o> simonjb: cool, thanks
2015-01-08T19:45:38 <simonjb> Justin_o, Bosmon: cindyli1 and I were just talking about the /authorizations endpoint (what I am currently working on) and there\'s a case I wanted to get your thoughts on http://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-1057
2015-01-08T19:47:35 <simonjb> Justin_o, Bosmon, cindyli1: the case is what to return for GET /authorizations/[authDecisionId]/preferences when the authDecision exists but the user\'s selectedPreferences is undefined in the dataStore (it\'s one of those cases that \'shouldn\'t\' happen once everything is lined up but it\'s a possibility if an authorize_decision is POSTed without selectedPreferences
2015-01-08T19:48:42 <simonjb> it\'s not really a 404 case I don\'t think but maybe "{}" or "null"? we can\'t return undefined as we want to return JSON
2015-01-08T19:50:24 <simonjb> it\'s this tricky inbetween case when we want to handle both the binary case and the selections case
2015-01-08T19:51:28 <Justin_o> simonjb: i believe we are handling this with "{}"
2015-01-08T19:51:38 <Justin_o> which says that nothing has been allowed
2015-01-08T19:51:56 <Justin_o> the everything allowed case looks like {"": true}
2015-01-08T19:52:07 <simonjb> ah, ok
2015-01-08T19:52:59 <simonjb> then, I wonder if we don\'t store undefinied in the dataStore, but rather one of {} or {"": true}
2015-01-08T19:53:06 <simonjb> right now I would store undefined
