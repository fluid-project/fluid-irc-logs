b'2015-10-15T16:31:05 <Bosmon> There would be widespread outrage if npm installs failed all the time like this
2015-10-15T16:31:25 <Justin_o> Bosmon: I\'d expect that :)
2015-10-15T16:31:31 <Bosmon> I suspect that the vagrant folks have not implemented filesystem synchronisation properly in their shared folders impl on Windows
2015-10-15T16:31:49 * gtirloni joined the channel
2015-10-15T16:32:00 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i\'m writing up some tests now for the publish module, will you be around for a while longer. I\'m hoping you can look at it before i request to move the repo over to the fluid-project space
2015-10-15T16:32:04 <Bosmon> What I guess happens is, that for a small interval of time after you have written a file in a shared folder, it will be "locked" somehow - and on a very slow machine, npm can try to rename the file within that interval of time
2015-10-15T16:32:20 <Bosmon> Justin_o - sure - looking forward to it
2015-10-15T16:32:25 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks :)
2015-10-15T16:32:50 <Bosmon> So if it helps any with the CentOS issue, I also got a dialog box from VirtualBox that reads this:
2015-10-15T16:32:50 <Justin_o> Bosmon: avtar and simonjb were speculating that it might have to do with the path length... but we hadn\'t tried it out locally yet
2015-10-15T16:33:13 <Bosmon> "VT-x/AMD-V hardware acceleration is not available on your system. Your 64-bit guest will fail to detect a 64-bit CPU and will not be able to boot"
2015-10-15T16:33:56 <Justin_o> Bosmon: :(
2015-10-15T16:34:04 <Justin_o> is that something you could enable?
2015-10-15T16:34:15 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I don\'t think the path length is an issue - the length of the path which triggers the error is only 104 characters which is massively shorter than any FS limits
2015-10-15T16:34:23 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I have no idea :)
2015-10-15T16:35:16 <Bosmon> Justin_o - actually yes
2015-10-15T16:35:19 <Bosmon> I remember this now
2015-10-15T16:35:59 <Bosmon> I had a BIOS setting I needed to flip in order to get my OS/2 guests working and I recently reset my BIOS settings to the defaults following a lot of boot hassle...... I\'ll go back into the BIOS and see if I can find that setting again
2015-10-15T16:36:14 <Justin_o> Bosmon: hopefully that\'ll fix it
2015-10-15T16:36:47 * slim_ has quit
2015-10-15T16:40:30 <Bosmon> Justin_o - although I had to change the port number in the app when I started it outside the VM, 8080 is an extremely commonly used one
2015-10-15T16:40:49 <Bosmon> Also it wasn\'t clear to me which URL I should visit in order to see the app, the README suggested that "/" should be resolvable which it wasn\'t
2015-10-15T16:41:20 * sepidehshahi has quit
2015-10-15T16:41:51 <Bosmon> Ok, looks like the BIOS setting is unexpectedly named "SVM" ...
2015-10-15T16:43:18 <Justin_o> Bosmon:  in this particular case you\'d need to go to one of the demos.. e.g. http://localhost:8080/demos/prefsServerIntegration/
2015-10-15T16:43:23 <Justin_o> which is the one with the integrations
2015-10-15T16:44:13 <Justin_o> Bosmon: I guess i should update the readme to be /demos
2015-10-15T16:44:18 <Justin_o> maybe that would be clearer
2015-10-15T16:45:39 <Justin_o> i\'ve made a minor change to the README
2015-10-15T16:45:42 <Justin_o> Bosmon: ^

2015-10-15T17:17:48 <avtar> Bosmon: just to confirm, do the contents of Justin_o\'s branch works for you using your local, non-vm node setup?
2015-10-15T17:18:23 <Bosmon> avtar - yes
2015-10-15T17:18:24 <avtar> *work
2015-10-15T17:20:47 <avtar> ok that\'s good to know
2015-10-15T17:21:10 <avtar> i tested this now using a windows 8.1 machine and get the same error you reported earlier
2015-10-15T17:21:59 <avtar> i tested it on monday on the same machine and was able to bring up the vm and access the demo
2015-10-15T17:22:15 <avtar> that was before this change https://github.com/jobara/first-discovery-server/commit/3fad2b01026fcc92e67a3380bf1d50686f5ed1c7

2015-10-15T17:59:29 <Bosmon> avtar - I imagine the appearance of the error will be extremely inconsistent
2015-10-15T18:03:05 <avtar> Bosmon: yes, that appears to be the case :/
2015-10-15T18:03:29 <Bosmon> If we were interested, we could try running 10 trials before and after, but my guess is that the base frequency of the problem will be pretty consistent
2015-10-15T18:03:41 <Bosmon> In that the operative driver is that "npm is thrashing the filesystem a lot"
2015-10-15T18:03:59 <Bosmon> My impression is that the problem is "frequent enough to consider that this approach is unworkable" : P

2015-10-15T19:19:30 <Bosmon> Well, not enormously near... but I guess it wouldn\'t be terribly hard, if we had decided to
2015-10-15T19:19:45 <Bosmon> It seems like a step in the wrong direction though, if we\'re planning for a "micromodulic" future
2015-10-15T19:22:05 <colinclark> yes, it is
2015-10-15T19:22:59 <colinclark> yet node-jqunit represents a somehow apparently confusing thing for some people
2015-10-15T19:23:09 <colinclark> it\'s a bit strange

2015-10-15T21:39:27 <Bosmon> Hi there AVVATTAR :)
2015-10-15T21:41:32 <avtar> how\'s it going?
2015-10-15T21:42:49 <Bosmon> It is tolerable
2015-10-15T21:42:51 <Bosmon> How is it over there?
2015-10-15T21:44:37 <avtar> well, it\'s the end of the day
2015-10-15T21:44:46 <avtar> it started raining
2015-10-15T21:45:00 <avtar> i have a not so great workaround for you
2015-10-15T21:45:18 <Bosmon> What is it?
2015-10-15T21:45:48 <avtar> do you have powershell >= 3 installed?
2015-10-15T21:45:52 <Bosmon> No
2015-10-15T21:46:03 <Bosmon> I don\'t use it
2015-10-15T21:46:17 <Bosmon> How might it help?
2015-10-15T21:46:26 <avtar> https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/synced-folders/smb.html
2015-10-15T21:46:54 <Bosmon> bah
2015-10-15T21:46:56 <avtar> smb shared folders need it
2015-10-15T21:47:09 <avtar> you\'ll also need to run the cygwin shell as an administrator
2015-10-15T21:47:29 <avtar> but beyond that i haven\'t been able to come up with a workaround for this issue
2015-10-15T21:47:39 <Bosmon> Yes
2015-10-15T21:47:57 <Bosmon> It may be, as colinclark is sometimes suggesting, that we may have to abandon vagrant-based solutions
2015-10-15T21:48:07 <avtar> gtirloni mentioned he was able to get a particular config working on a win10 host but i saw the same error with win 8.1
2015-10-15T21:48:22 <avtar> well, the issue is not so much vagrant, as virtualbox shared folders
2015-10-15T21:48:27 <Bosmon> Yes
2015-10-15T21:48:28 <avtar> which is what docker uses under the hood
2015-10-15T21:48:34 <Bosmon> !!!!!!!!!!
2015-10-15T21:48:37 <Bosmon> !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2015-10-15T21:48:40 <avtar> so
2015-10-15T21:48:51 <Bosmon> Docker uses them too?
2015-10-15T21:49:06 <avtar> https://docs.docker.com/machine/drivers/virtualbox/
2015-10-15T21:49:46 <Bosmon> Ok
2015-10-15T21:49:53 <Bosmon> What about other solutions for hosting Docker containers on Windows
2015-10-15T21:49:57 <Bosmon> Such as the so-called "Hyper-V" ......
2015-10-15T21:52:05 <avtar> looks like they share more than just one project directory https://github.com/docker/boot2docker/issues/1
2015-10-15T21:52:41 <avtar> i\'m not sure about hyper-v
2015-10-15T21:54:38 <Bosmon> SMB shares don\'t sound encouraging
2015-10-15T21:54:54 <Bosmon> I think, in practice, we are just trying to be too ambitious - we don\'t really, I think, need "shared folders" at all
2015-10-15T21:55:04 <Bosmon> We simply need to get "some files" into the VM from the outside
2015-10-15T21:55:29 <Bosmon> actually
2015-10-15T21:55:37 <Bosmon> Perhaps that\'s a better route to a solution
2015-10-15T21:55:49 <Bosmon> That is, to continue with the existing shared folders route, but share them to a different path
2015-10-15T21:55:57 <Bosmon> And then copy them to an unshared path in order to run npm on them
2015-10-15T21:58:17 <avtar> yeah i came across that suggestion as well, step 3 on http://perrymitchell.net/article/npm-symlinks-through-vagrant-windows/
2015-10-15T21:59:35 <Bosmon> Ok
2015-10-15T21:59:39 <avtar> i\'ll try it out tomorrow
2015-10-15T21:59:44 <Bosmon> That seems like useful confirmation
2015-10-15T21:59:49 <Bosmon> What\'s your opinion of it?
2015-10-15T22:01:21 <Bosmon> The symlink idea seems a little wacky, but I guess it is a quicker way to get around the problem than a bulk copy
2015-10-15T22:02:22 <Bosmon> But it seems this "setextradata" will be another point of fragility
2015-10-15T22:04:53 <avtar> yes
2015-10-15T22:05:04 <Bosmon> The post he references suggests that Vagrant made this a default in 2013
2015-10-15T22:05:08 <Bosmon> So we may get away without it
2015-10-15T22:05:09 <avtar> it\'s disabled by default https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/10085#comment:12
2015-10-15T22:05:12 <Bosmon> Ah
2015-10-15T22:05:21 <Bosmon> https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/issues/713#issuecomment-4416384
2015-10-15T22:06:53 <Bosmon> Anyway, if this doesn\'t work, we can simply issue a cp -pr : P
2015-10-15T22:07:06 <avtar> this is what i learned today https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/issues/1953#issuecomment-147920047
2015-10-15T22:07:18 <avtar> things broke when virtualbox 5 was released
2015-10-15T22:07:45 <Bosmon> urgh
2015-10-15T22:07:47 <Bosmon> ok, fine
2015-10-15T22:07:56 <avtar> giovanni said this worked for him on the win10 host https://gist.github.com/avtar/c83d22b29ca7099734dd#file-gistfile1-txt-L48
2015-10-15T22:08:09 <Bosmon> ok
2015-10-15T22:08:21 <avtar> but i tried all different variations on win8 which is probably closer to your env
2015-10-15T22:08:39 <Bosmon> I think trying to do too much within the shared folders area is just asking for trouble
2015-10-15T22:08:50 <Bosmon> We should be grateful enough we can get any files into it at all :)
2015-10-15T22:09:09 <avtar> yes
2015-10-15T22:09:25 <avtar> this is why i initially opted for rsync
2015-10-15T22:09:31 <Bosmon> Get them in, SMASH\'N\'GRAB, then GET OUT
2015-10-15T22:10:00 <avtar> i\'ll try the other workaround tomorrow and let you know how that goes
2015-10-15T22:10:09 <Bosmon> avtar - awesome
2015-10-15T22:10:21 <Bosmon> I am convinced we will get there in the end
2015-10-15T22:10:26 <Bosmon> Even if it means..... COPYING SOME FILES
2015-10-15T22:19:51 <avtar> http://oliverguenther.de/2015/05/docker-host-volume-synchronization/
2015-10-15T22:20:45 <avtar> all these workaround seem very familiar :/
2015-10-15T22:21:19 <avtar> i\'d be curious to know what the experience is like with vmware
2015-10-15T22:27:13 <Bosmon> I\'ve never been able to get files into a vmware either

2015-10-15T13:39:26 <the-t-in-rtf> I have a hash I have been using which is compatible with Fluid 2.0, but @bosmon is probably the best to ask.
2015-10-15T13:39:34 <slim_> this one https://github.com/fluid-project/node-jqUnit
2015-10-15T13:39:42 <slim_> no assert lib for gpii?
2015-10-15T13:40:06 <the-t-in-rtf> I have been using this hash:  "jqUnit": "git://github.com/fluid-project/node-jqUnit.git#d46bb932fa4069770852c51a92182939958f2d75",
2015-10-15T13:40:18 <the-t-in-rtf> Antranig can comment on whether master is recent enough.
2015-10-15T13:40:26 <the-t-in-rtf> What do you mean by no assert lib?
2015-10-15T13:40:58 <slim_> the-t-in-rtf: doh - of course xunit includes asserts
2015-10-15T13:41:25 <the-t-in-rtf> Yes, I sometimes have to look at the docs for QUnit to see what\'s supported, but there are a good range.
2015-10-15T13:41:26 <slim_> hash?
2015-10-15T13:41:32 <the-t-in-rtf> a particular commit.
2015-10-15T13:41:39 <slim_> oh. I see
2015-10-15T13:41:43 <the-t-in-rtf> for example a branch that has not been merged.
2015-10-15T13:42:12 <slim_> I\'m ussing whatever gets installed for GPII - am running low down unit tests
2015-10-15T13:42:25 <slim_> should find right package.sjon I gue3ss :0
2015-10-15T13:42:26 <the-t-in-rtf> It only matters if you are in the Fluid 2.0 world.
2015-10-15T13:42:37 <the-t-in-rtf> For example, if you are in the post autoInit world
2015-10-15T13:42:38 <slim_> ooh - am i? I doubt it
2015-10-15T13:42:42 <slim_> I\'m in GPII world
2015-10-15T13:43:16 <the-t-in-rtf> As long as you have a matching set of infusion and jqUnit, it should make very little difference to you.
2015-10-15T13:43:52 <slim_> so I\'m using whatever require() is finding.
2015-10-15T13:44:04 <the-t-in-rtf> Yes, which is based on your package.json / npm install
2015-10-15T13:44:04 <slim_> would like matching docs as adding new tests
2015-10-15T13:44:23 <the-t-in-rtf> unless you have installed it globally, which seems like a very bad idea.
2015-10-15T13:44:54 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, open your package.json, you should be able to paste the URL there into a browser and see / search the source online.
2015-10-15T13:45:20 <slim_> hmm nothing explict  in package.json windows - ho hum
2015-10-15T13:47:38 <slim_> the-t-in-rtf: yeah - it\'s in universal package.json - tah
2015-10-15T13:48:07 <slim_> git://github.com/fluid-project/node-jqUnit.git#e2083fba5404c8e7a474712102871150c037e20b
2015-10-15T13:49:10 <the-t-in-rtf> The syntax is slightly different, here it is online:  https://github.com/fluid-project/node-jqUnit/tree/e2083fba5404c8e7a474712102871150c037e20b
2015-10-15T13:49:51 <slim_> aha - was trying to figure out why couldn\'t open it with git protocol :) -thanks very much
2015-10-15T13:49:52 <the-t-in-rtf> That is definitely old world.
2015-10-15T13:50:03 <the-t-in-rtf> It still uses autoInit.
2015-10-15T13:51:03 <the-t-in-rtf> Odd, so does the version I have.
2015-10-15T13:51:07 <slim_> didn\'t know you could do that with GitHub - nice
2015-10-15T13:51:37 <the-t-in-rtf> It is more tedious than it should be, you have to browse the commits and compare the hash by eyeball.
2015-10-15T13:51:42 <slim_> but guess that underlies PR reviews etc
2015-10-15T13:51:50 <slim_> oh
2015-10-15T13:52:23 <slim_> the-t-in-rtf: out of interest why a fluid specific version of jqUnit?
2015-10-15T13:53:58 <the-t-in-rtf> I assume like so much else a wrapper was needed to be able to write tests largely as configuration.
2015-10-15T13:54:06 * slim_ read the docs and get an idea :)
2015-10-15T13:54:23 <slim_> ye - looks like it from Readme
2015-10-15T13:54:24 <the-t-in-rtf> There are also often bugs and shortcomings in the things we evolve into components.
2015-10-15T13:54:37 <the-t-in-rtf> Which that one level of wrapping and abstraction lets us address.
2015-10-15T13:56:04 <slim_> sure - though we them end up maintain it  - though can alleviate risk with careful management.
2015-10-15T13:56:26 <slim_> Plus there is a view that every thing you require you need to understand and take ownership of

2015-10-15T15:46:46 <colinclark> slim_: You\'re not in the Infusion 2.0 world yet
2015-10-15T15:46:56 <colinclark> and the-t-in-rtf: node-jqunit will work with any version of Infusion
2015-10-15T15:47:16 <colinclark> either the 1.9.x branch currently used by the GPII core framework, or the 2.x line you\'re using
2015-10-15T15:47:33 <colinclark> by virtue of the fact that node-jqunit binds with very little of Infusion itslef
2015-10-15T15:49:42 <colinclark> slim_: I\'m not sure I understand your question about "a Fluid-specific version of jqUnit"
2015-10-15T15:49:56 <colinclark> You\'re aware that the Fluid community created jqUnit, right?
2015-10-15T15:50:05 <colinclark> it\'s an xUnit-style wrapper around QUnit
2015-10-15T15:50:30 <colinclark> which also adds very useful support for running the same tests in both a browser and Node.js
2015-10-15T15:56:56 <the-t-in-rtf> Thanks @colinclark, not sure why I originally fixated on that comment.  Likely it was paired with the specific 2.0 compatible Kettle that I needed to use in newer work.
2015-10-15T15:57:02 <the-t-in-rtf> s/comment/commit/
2015-10-15T15:57:16 * gtirloni joined the channel
2015-10-15T15:57:19 <colinclark> yep, perhaps
2015-10-15T15:57:26 <the-t-in-rtf> By that I mean that I saw it in a working example and copied both.
2015-10-15T15:57:31 <the-t-in-rtf> Not that it necessarily is required\xe2\x80\xa6 :P
2015-10-15T15:57:36 <colinclark> I use node-jqunit in osc.js, one of my libaries
2015-10-15T15:57:41 <colinclark> which doesnt even depend on Infusion
2015-10-15T15:57:48 <colinclark> what\'s so great about it is how you can run the same tests in both environments
2015-10-15T15:58:00 <the-t-in-rtf> My comment was related to its own tests.
2015-10-15T15:58:03 <colinclark> right
2015-10-15T15:58:12 <the-t-in-rtf> Which do use 1.9 isms like "autoInit"
2015-10-15T15:58:18 <colinclark> ah, yes
2015-10-15T15:58:33 <colinclark> I believe the plan is to roll node-jqUnit back into Infusion
2015-10-15T15:58:41 <colinclark> rather than dealing with circular dependencies
2015-10-15T16:00:00 <colinclark> since jqUnit itself ships as part of Infusion
2015-10-15T16:00:50 <Bosmon> colinclark - is that the plan? : P
2015-10-15T16:01:04 <Bosmon> btw, avtar, Justin_o - bad news on the new vagrant stuff, I\'m afraid
2015-10-15T16:01:35 <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-project/first-discovery-server/pull/2#issuecomment-148386418
2015-10-15T16:01:48 <Bosmon> The name of the bad news is.....   ETXTBSY
2015-10-15T16:01:56 <Bosmon> An unpreposessing name if ever I saw one
2015-10-15T16:03:22 * colinclark has quit
2015-10-15T16:05:28 * clown has quit
2015-10-15T16:13:17 <Justin_o> Bosmon: avtar simonjb and I were just talking about that
2015-10-15T16:13:26 <Justin_o> Bosmon: avtar is going to try it out on a machine here
2015-10-15T16:13:44 <Justin_o> Bosmon: also, are you able to run my pull request locally, outside of using the vm
2015-10-15T16:14:14 * alanharnum joined the channel
2015-10-15T16:18:33 * clown joined the channel
2015-10-15T16:23:11 * gtirloni joined the channel
2015-10-15T16:28:57 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, the pull request itself works fine
2015-10-15T16:29:11 <Bosmon> Unfortunately I have a couple more problems to report - firstly, the new Centos VM you have upgraded to doesn\'t run on my machine
2015-10-15T16:29:11 <Justin_o> Bosmon: that\'s good at least :)
2015-10-15T16:29:40 <Bosmon> It reports at startup: "This kernel requires an x86-64 CPU, but only detected an i686 CPU: This processor is unsupported in CentOS 7"
2015-10-15T16:29:46 <Justin_o> Bosmon: simonjb had been wondering if the error you reported was specific to the VM or if it could be an issue in general.
2015-10-15T16:30:06 <Justin_o> Bosmon: oh, you have a 32bit processor?
2015-10-15T16:30:09 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I expect it will be an issue in general - my best guess is that this is a fault in the implementation of vagrant shared folders
2015-10-15T16:30:19 <Bosmon> Justin_o - actually I don\'t, but I have a 64bit AMD processor
2015-10-15T16:30:36 <Bosmon> Which is usually recognised as 64 bit for most purposes, but clearly not for the purposes of this VM
2015-10-15T16:30:38 <Justin_o> Bosmon: sorry, in general i meant outside of using a vm at all
2015-10-15T16:30:43 <Justin_o> and just running on windows..
2015-10-15T16:30:53 <Bosmon> Justin_o - no, I expect the npm script will run just fine outside a VM
