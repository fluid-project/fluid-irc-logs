2015-07-30T20:00:59 <kasparnet> Bosmon, simonjb: always filtering the matchMakerOutput seem sensible to me as well
2015-07-30T20:01:06 <kasparnet> thanks for thinking/talking through this
2015-07-30T20:05:24 <simonjb> thanks kasparnet
2015-07-30T20:06:40 <simonjb> Bosmon, kasparnet: the matchMakerOutput is the earliest that we can filter? is this right? because it's the first time we have the user preferences expressed in solution-specific terms?
2015-07-30T20:07:06 <Bosmon> simonjb - in theory, we had considered filtering the preferences even before we sent them to the matchmaker
2015-07-30T20:07:21 <Bosmon> But this had seemed a bit excessive at the time
2015-07-30T20:07:41 <Bosmon> It would be better to wait until our matchmaker ecology has thinned out a bit and we can think about the situation more clearly
2015-07-30T20:08:08 <simonjb> ok, so for now the matchMakerOutput seems like the right place?
2015-07-30T20:08:14 <Bosmon> simonjb - I think so, yes
2015-07-30T20:08:23 <simonjb> cool
2015-07-30T20:08:53 <kasparnet> simonjb, Bosmon: yeah, I agree
2015-07-30T20:12:21 <Bosmon> jhernandez, colinclark - do you happen to remember who might have grabbed that Phoenix receipt that the-t-in-rtf was mentioning?
2015-07-30T20:12:51 <colinclark> I checked and I don't have it. My memory was that she didn't give a total receipt, but individual ones
2015-07-30T20:12:57 <Bosmon> aha
2015-07-30T20:13:36 <colinclark> but I'm not sure
2015-07-30T20:13:37 <colinclark> since if that was the case, I'd have one :)

If not, I will merge it. The code looks good to me and all tests pass

b'2015-07-30T15:17:47 <maozillah> has anyone ever had issues with global search in sublime text 2?
2015-07-30T15:18:01 <maozillah> my searches seem to be consistently missing some files
2015-07-30T15:21:40 <Justin_o> cindyli: ^
2015-07-30T15:22:36 <cindyli> maozillah: check the "where" field in the search dialog
2015-07-30T15:24:22 <maozillah> cindyli: is open files and folders, i think that refers to everything
2015-07-30T15:24:42 <maozillah> the internet is saying an update to sublime 3 fixes the problem so i guess i\xe2\x80\x99ll see

2015-07-30T17:23:02 <Bosmon> Hi Justin_o - thanks for the TTS Safari report
2015-07-30T17:23:07 <Bosmon> Is this working in current trunk?
2015-07-30T17:24:54 * danayo joined the channel
2015-07-30T17:24:55 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes, it\'s working in trunk. Although it seems if run the one from your branch in another tab it can cause the one in master to stop working. Not sure why that is, could be putting the Speechsynthesizer in an error state or something...
2015-07-30T17:25:07 <Bosmon> ok
2015-07-30T17:25:24 <Bosmon> I might have to get some help in studying this since I don\'t have anything I could run Safari on
2015-07-30T17:25:40 <Justin_o> Bosmon: let me know what you\'d like me to try
2015-07-30T17:25:49 <Justin_o> i can do some screen sharing with you too if that would help
2015-07-30T17:26:14 <Bosmon> Justin_o - well, I don\'t really know : P
2015-07-30T17:26:18 <Bosmon> Are there any console errors?
2015-07-30T17:26:24 <Justin_o> none
2015-07-30T17:26:40 <Bosmon> Ok
2015-07-30T17:26:55 <Bosmon> Perhaps the problem is that the checkTTSSupport function for some reason can\'t operate a 2nd time on Safari
2015-07-30T17:27:15 <Bosmon> Could you trace into it to see if its promise ever resolves on the 2nd test?
2015-07-30T17:28:31 <Justin_o> i think i found the bug
2015-07-30T17:28:31 <Bosmon> Perhaps you could put some logging into the startStop test to see if any of its code ever begins to execute
2015-07-30T17:28:34 <Bosmon> Ah great
2015-07-30T17:28:38 <Bosmon> That was quick :)
2015-07-30T17:28:48 <Justin_o> i don\'t see a call to jqUnit.start()
2015-07-30T17:28:57 <Bosmon> Justin_o - where isn\'t there one?
2015-07-30T17:29:06 <Justin_o> there is only one in the Initialization Test
2015-07-30T17:29:10 <Justin_o> i don\'t see one in  the other two
2015-07-30T17:29:18 <Bosmon> Justin_o - the other two tests naturally issue them by themselves
2015-07-30T17:29:23 <Bosmon> Given they were originally async tests
2015-07-30T17:29:46 <Justin_o> never mind, i didn\'t realize there were calling other functions.. i was being too hasty :(
2015-07-30T17:29:56 <Bosmon> Justin_o - didn\'t you write these? : P
2015-07-30T17:30:06 <Justin_o> yes but it was a while ago :)
2015-07-30T17:31:36 <Justin_o> it\'s dying on the "Start and Stop Events" test
2015-07-30T17:31:41 <Justin_o> it gets into that block
2015-07-30T17:31:53 <Bosmon> Oh, interesting
2015-07-30T17:32:02 <Bosmon> I wonder how it can die
2015-07-30T17:32:34 <Bosmon> Does it execute start but not stop?
2015-07-30T17:33:18 <Justin_o> yes, the onStart event listener is hit, but the onStop isn\'t
2015-07-30T17:36:29 <Bosmon> Justin_o - ok, here\'s an idea - could you try modifying your checkTTSSupport function so that it doesn\'t resolve the promise until it receives both start and stop?
2015-07-30T17:36:43 <Bosmon> Perhaps the problem is that SpeechSynthesis goes bananas if you try to overlap speech
2015-07-30T17:37:57 <Justin_o> i suppose that\'s possible, i\'ll pull down your branch and give it a try
2015-07-30T17:38:03 <Bosmon> Justin_o - cheers
2015-07-30T17:39:59 * cindyli joined the channel
2015-07-30T17:41:38 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i changed it to resolve after onstop. it seems to work.
2015-07-30T17:41:44 <Justin_o> let me test it in some other browsers.
2015-07-30T17:41:45 <Bosmon> Justin_o - great!
2015-07-30T17:42:56 <Justin_o> Bosmon: so i\'m looking at the test in FF. Do you think it\'s confusing the way the tests run but as an assert that says it\'s not supported. That message is kind of hidden.

2015-07-30T19:36:44 <simonjb> hi Bosmon, are you available for some questions on privacy filtering for the flow manager?
2015-07-30T19:37:19 <Bosmon> simonjb - sure
2015-07-30T19:39:21 <simonjb> Bosmon: awesome, I was looking at our current filtering for the oauth2 flow manager and we are doing the filtering at point gpii.request.flowManager.processMatch.priorities.privacyFilter in the processMatch listener chain of gpii.request.flowManager.matchMakingRequest
2015-07-30T19:39:57 <simonjb> by registering a listener in kettle.requests.request.handler.oauth2Settings
2015-07-30T19:40:17 <simonjb> I was taking a look at the contextPayload at this poing in the chain
2015-07-30T19:41:01 <simonjb> and we have 2 sets of settings: in matchMakerOutput and in activeConfiguration
2015-07-30T19:41:13 <simonjb> we filter the settings in activeConfiguration
2015-07-30T19:41:44 <simonjb> (which is derived from matchMakerOutput and set in gpii.contextManager.evaluateMatch
2015-07-30T19:41:48 <simonjb> )
2015-07-30T19:42:37 <simonjb> only filtering this section is fine because for the Cloud Based Flow Manager we only return the settings and don\'t care about the rest of the \'megaPayload\'
2015-07-30T19:43:31 <simonjb> but for the untrusted hybrid, as discussed yesterday we are returning more data, including both matchMakerOutput and activeConfiguration
2015-07-30T19:44:24 <simonjb> I\'m thinking: does it make sense to move the pirvacy filtering to earlier in the chain and filter instead within the matchMakerOutput?
2015-07-30T19:44:45 <Bosmon> simonjb - that seems correct, yes
2015-07-30T19:45:02 <Bosmon> And as far as I can see, the current behaviour must actually be incorrect
2015-07-30T19:45:59 <Bosmon> Since it looks like gpii.contextManager.evaluateConditions doesn\'t bother to do the filtering again when it changes the activeConfiguration
2015-07-30T19:46:49 <simonjb> which, I think, was fine for the web case as we didn\'t care about contexts
2015-07-30T19:46:56 * sepideh has quit
2015-07-30T19:46:58 <simonjb> but we can no longer ignore
2015-07-30T19:47:26 <Bosmon> Ok, yes
2015-07-30T19:47:34 <Bosmon> Well, well spotted :)
2015-07-30T19:48:02 <Bosmon> To be safe and consistent, we may as well just always apply filtering to every entry in matchMakerOutput in every configuration - what do you think?
2015-07-30T19:48:55 <simonjb> yes, that was my thinking because they will all be sent back to the local flow manager
2015-07-30T19:49:16 <simonjb> we need to filter everything that is in that response

2015-07-30T12:28:05 <Justin_o> Bosmon: any thoughts on what to do about that? and which browser were you seeing that issue in?
2015-07-30T12:28:55 <Bosmon> Justin_o - it was in Chrome
2015-07-30T12:29:09 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I\'ve patched the issue in my big branch and it seems to work
2015-07-30T12:29:45 <Bosmon> I think that there is a general condition that QUnit expects the first test issued in an instance to be issued within a certain time window of it starting up
2015-07-30T12:30:20 <Justin_o> ah ;(
2015-07-30T12:30:38 <Justin_o> what did you do to correct this? Did you change something in QUnit or add a dummy test?
2015-07-30T12:30:39 <Bosmon> That time might be 13ms
2015-07-30T12:30:52 <Bosmon> Since that is a figure that the QUnit developers seem to like a lot : P
2015-07-30T12:30:56 <Bosmon> It appears many times in their code
2015-07-30T12:31:11 <Bosmon> Justin_o - First I had the idea of the dummy test, but I realised that wouldn\'t solve the problem either
2015-07-30T12:31:12 <Justin_o> 13 isn\'t a very lucky number, they should know it\'s doomed to cause issues
2015-07-30T12:31:18 <Bosmon> Yes :)
2015-07-30T12:31:36 <Bosmon> What I did was to invert the control structure in the tests, so that each of them always starts immediately
2015-07-30T12:32:15 <Bosmon> Each of them then become async, and that they then issue the feature detect on starting - once it resolves, they then decide whether to issue the real test or a dummy
2015-07-30T12:33:13 <Bosmon> Justin_o - here\'s an example of one of these: https://github.com/amb26/infusion/blob/fba915faecc34d377083ee680eb9adb5736d763c/tests/component-tests/textToSpeech/js/TextToSpeechTests.js#L123
2015-07-30T12:33:39 <Bosmon> I see I need to clean this up a little more and add a comment....
2015-07-30T12:35:22 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yah.. i think this can be removed now https://github.com/amb26/infusion/blob/fba915faecc34d377083ee680eb9adb5736d763c/tests/component-tests/textToSpeech/js/TextToSpeechTests.js#L103
2015-07-30T12:35:30 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes
2015-07-30T12:35:31 <Justin_o> looks a lot cleaner now though for sure
2015-07-30T12:35:44 <Bosmon> It\'s a shame that the QUnit codebase is i) so opaque, and ii) we depend on it so much
2015-07-30T12:35:53 <Bosmon> But we can\'t rewrite everything in the world : P
2015-07-30T12:36:00 <Justin_o> :)
2015-07-30T12:36:15 <Justin_o> i guess we could switch to a different test harness, not sure it will be better though
2015-07-30T12:36:28 <Bosmon> I can\'t imagine it could possibly justify the effort
2015-07-30T12:36:38 <Bosmon> We\'ve been writing test cases on the QUnit foundation for about 7 years now
2015-07-30T12:36:44 <Justin_o> yes.. long time
2015-07-30T12:36:51 <Bosmon> There are a couple of bugs we absolutely have to fix though
2015-07-30T12:36:57 <Justin_o> i wonder how hard it would be though.. i mean you\'ve pretty much wrapped everything anyways
2015-07-30T12:37:57 <Bosmon> Well, it\'s not the top end of the API that is the problem, but the bottom end
2015-07-30T12:38:09 <Bosmon> By using QUnit, in theory we get access to the ecosystem of things which consume its tests
2015-07-30T12:38:18 <Bosmon> Such as, for example, browserling and things like that
2015-07-30T12:38:28 <Bosmon> As well as things like the QUnit-composite plugin etc.
2015-07-30T12:38:47 <Bosmon> But, for example, this line in QUnit is a very clear bug: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/tests/lib/qunit/js/qunit.js#L468
2015-07-30T12:39:07 <Bosmon> Because of it we have to cut and paste a bogus first element into very many of our IoC testing framework fixtures
2015-07-30T12:39:28 <Bosmon> It\'s just I\'ve never had the time to investigate it properly and try to see what the costs would be of trying to fix it
2015-07-30T12:39:52 <Bosmon> But you can see it involves another recurrence of the magic hard-coded number 13 : P

2015-07-30T12:41:42 <Justin_o> yes.. i saw that 13.. what a strange number to use for timeout

2015-07-30T12:53:20 <Bosmon> Justin_o - what I believe is that this derives from behaviour of old versions of IE on Windows
2015-07-30T12:54:42 <Justin_o> :(
2015-07-30T12:54:54 <Justin_o> it\'s still causing us havok
2015-07-30T12:55:04 <Bosmon> It used to be that 13ms was the smallest time that was possible to resolve on old 16-bit versions of Windows
2015-07-30T12:55:07 <Bosmon> https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms725496(v=vs.85).aspx
2015-07-30T12:55:14 <Bosmon> In fact, this API is still backwards-compatible with it : P
2015-07-30T12:56:07 <Justin_o> i don\'t think we support anything that would run on a 16-bit version of windows...
2015-07-30T12:56:17 <Bosmon> we don\'t, no
2015-07-30T12:56:23 <Bosmon> Nonetheless, this code still exists :)
2015-07-30T12:57:08 <Justin_o> does jQuery even support anything that does, could we send them a patch?
2015-07-30T12:57:29 <Bosmon> We could.... if we had the resources to make absolutely sure that it wouldn\'t break anything
2015-07-30T12:57:39 <Bosmon> Unfortunately, we mostly lack those resources even for code that we write ourselves : P
2015-07-30T12:58:02 <Bosmon> I did get QUnit to accept a patch a while back, but it was a huge amount of work
2015-07-30T12:58:12 <Justin_o> Bosmon: hopefully someone on their end could help with some testing.. they do have that browser stack integration
2015-07-30T12:58:26 <Justin_o> really.. i wonder if it is easier now that they have automated test runs
2015-07-30T12:58:52 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, but it\'s 3rd party code that they\'d worry about breaking.... and there is an absolutely vast installed base of QUnit users
2015-07-30T12:59:06 <Justin_o> :(
2015-07-30T12:59:13 <Justin_o> okay
2015-07-30T12:59:15 <Bosmon> In theory, this would lead them to be extremely conservative people.... and I think in general it does
2015-07-30T12:59:29 <Bosmon> On the other hand, I see that they are trying to work on QUnit 2.x which is completely API incompatible
2015-07-30T12:59:39 <Bosmon> But so far they don\'t seem to have had the guts to relase it
2015-07-30T12:59:42 <Bosmon> release
2015-07-30T13:00:01 <Bosmon> There would be a huge uproar and then fork in their userbase
2015-07-30T13:00:07 <Justin_o> really.. is much better
2015-07-30T13:00:12 <Bosmon> Since I can\'t see that most people would have much incentive to upgrade
2015-07-30T13:00:23 <Justin_o> do they have a pre-release version we could switch to?
2015-07-30T13:00:30 <Bosmon> Well, I don\'t see it offers any corresponding new marvellous features in exchange for the breakage
2015-07-30T13:01:00 <Justin_o> Bosmon: seems like low value then
2015-07-30T13:01:20 <Bosmon> Probably... which is why they seem to have been sitting on it for over a year
2015-07-30T13:01:44 <Bosmon> A lot of it is stuff that we have done for ourselves already, like removing all of QUnit\'s stray globals from the global scope
2015-07-30T13:01:59 <Bosmon> But their approach to async tests is now completely different
2015-07-30T13:02:12 <Bosmon> QUnit.start and stop are completely gone
2015-07-30T13:02:26 <Bosmon> Which even with our wrapping would be awkward to abstract over, since we simply directly forward those calls to QUnit

2015-07-30T13:06:33 <Justin_o> Bosmon: how do they start and stop an async test?
2015-07-30T13:06:57 <Bosmon> Justin_o - it is now "instance-based" rather than "state-based".... if that makes any sense : P
2015-07-30T13:07:10 <Bosmon> Formerly QUnit.start/stop were a point of access to a piece of global state
2015-07-30T13:07:17 <Bosmon> "Whether the currently running test is suspended"
2015-07-30T13:07:34 <Bosmon> Now you make a specific request to QUnit to allocate an asynchronous "instance" for you, and use the API on that
2015-07-30T13:07:51 <Bosmon> it is an API which is functionally equivalent to promises, although promises don\'t explicitly appear in the API
2015-07-30T13:08:27 * alanharnum has quit
2015-07-30T13:09:38 <Justin_o> oh okay.. that does seem quite different
2015-07-30T13:11:19 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i was reading your pull request comment, is your pull request ready for another round of testing?
2015-07-30T13:11:25 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, it is ready
2015-07-30T13:11:51 <Justin_o> Bosmon: awesome, we\'ll try to do some more testing today
2015-07-30T13:12:04 <Justin_o> gtirloni: would you be able to redeploy Bosmon\'s branch?
2015-07-30T13:13:25 <gtirloni> Justin_o, sure, one sec

2015-07-30T13:49:59 <Bosmon> Hey there simonjb - just finishing up watching your friend Dann\'s talk on visualising persistent data structures - it\'s a really good talk!
2015-07-30T13:50:27 <Bosmon> My main take-home message is that applying persistence to apparently linear data structures is enormously complex and not to be done lightly :)
2015-07-30T13:51:02 <Bosmon> I\'m even more resolved to simply throw away arrays in their entirety in our new IMMUTABLE WORLD...
2015-07-30T13:51:08 <simonjb> Bosmon: glad that you enjoyed it!

2015-07-30T13:54:26 <simonjb> Dann is a really interesting guy -- he runs a co-working space here in Toronto called Bento Miso https://bentomiso.com/
2015-07-30T13:55:22 <simonjb> They host a number of meetups and group events including the Toronto Lisp group (that\'s where I know him from)
2015-07-30T13:55:32 <Bosmon> Oh great
2015-07-30T13:55:44 <Bosmon> I\'m looking forward to your lisp preso by the way - is that scheduled?
2015-07-30T13:56:14 <Bosmon> btw I uploaded the final version of my PPIG slides to our Presentations page - https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Presentations
2015-07-30T13:56:17 <simonjb> It\'s currently scheduled from August 19
2015-07-30T13:56:27 <simonjb> oh, great, I
2015-07-30T13:56:34 <simonjb> will check them out
2015-07-30T13:56:45 <simonjb> for August 19
2015-07-30T13:56:50 <simonjb> not from
2015-07-30T13:58:07 <Bosmon> Cool, I\'ve added it to my calendar :)
