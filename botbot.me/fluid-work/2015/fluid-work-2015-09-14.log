2015-09-14T14:55:20 <cindyli> hi Bosmon
2015-09-14T14:55:35 <Bosmon> Hi there cindyli
2015-09-14T14:56:31 <cindyli> Bosmon: the language panel in the first discovery has an initial model value lang: "en-US", populated from the primary schema
2015-09-14T14:56:43 <cindyli> i wanna override it to "nl-NL"
2015-09-14T14:56:59 <cindyli> so created a grade
2015-09-14T14:57:00 <cindyli> fluid.defaults("gpii.tests.langPanel", {
2015-09-14T14:57:00 <cindyli> gradeNames: ["fluid.modelComponent"],
2015-09-14T14:57:00 <cindyli> model: {
2015-09-14T14:57:00 <cindyli> lang: "nl-NL"
2015-09-14T14:57:00 <cindyli> }
2015-09-14T14:57:01 <cindyli> });
2015-09-14T14:57:17 <cindyli> and use distribute options to dispatch it to the lang panel
2015-09-14T14:57:27 <cindyli> {
2015-09-14T14:57:27 <cindyli> target: "{that gpii.firstDiscovery.panel.lang}.options",
2015-09-14T14:57:27 <cindyli> record: {
2015-09-14T14:57:27 <cindyli> gradeNames: ["gpii.tests.langPanel"]
2015-09-14T14:57:27 <cindyli> }
2015-09-14T14:57:27 <cindyli> }
2015-09-14T14:57:41 <cindyli> the overriding is not happening
2015-09-14T14:58:04 <Bosmon> That can be even shorter, btw - can target .options.gradeNames and then the record can just be the string "gpii.tests.langPanel"
2015-09-14T14:58:12 <cindyli> i debugged the gradeNames of the lang panel, the new grade is there
2015-09-14T14:58:32 * alanharnum joined the channel
2015-09-14T14:58:37 <Bosmon> cindyli - isn\'t the issue that the panel isn\'t in charge of the final model value?
2015-09-14T14:58:41 * kasparnet has quit
2015-09-14T14:58:56 <Bosmon> In that the model is computed by resolving the value of the initial model in the overall app first
2015-09-14T14:58:58 <cindyli> you mean this:
2015-09-14T14:58:59 <cindyli> {
2015-09-14T14:58:59 <cindyli> target: "{that gpii.firstDiscovery.panel.lang}.options.gradeNames",
2015-09-14T14:58:59 <cindyli> record: "gpii.tests.langPanel"
2015-09-14T14:58:59 <cindyli> }
2015-09-14T14:59:03 <Bosmon> cindyli - yes, that
2015-09-14T14:59:07 <Bosmon> It won\'t make any difference here
2015-09-14T14:59:14 <Bosmon> But it\'s a shorter way of expressing what you had written : P
2015-09-14T14:59:18 <cindyli> i know, much simple tho
2015-09-14T14:59:23 * alanharnum has quit
2015-09-14T14:59:26 <cindyli> yes
2015-09-14T14:59:40 * kasparnet joined the channel
2015-09-14T15:00:20 <Bosmon> cindyli - so, yes - isn\'t the issue that the final value of the initial model is actually computed in the "fluid.prefs.prefsEditor" ?
2015-09-14T15:00:27 <cindyli> yes, Bosmon, the model is computed. but should be overridable
2015-09-14T15:00:53 <Bosmon> cindyli - you can\'t override it from anywhere since I imagine you have all kinds of rules to make sure that updates don\'t propagate backwards during the initial transaction : P
2015-09-14T15:01:02 <Bosmon> Since the initial values held in the models of the individual panels are all junk
2015-09-14T15:01:16 <Bosmon> If you want to override the initial model values, you will have to override the place where the initial model is computed
2015-09-14T15:02:07 <Bosmon> The lang panel has nothing to do with the initial value of the language field
2015-09-14T15:02:50 <cindyli> umm\xe2\x80\xa6 i will think about it. needs to go to the check-in meeting now
2015-09-14T15:02:57 <Bosmon> ok cool
2015-09-14T15:03:18 * michelled1 joined the channel
2015-09-14T15:03:32 <Bosmon> In theory this is something we should be able to express in the relay system, but I don\'t currently know how
2015-09-14T15:03:44 <Bosmon> It implies that values were "tagged" somehow in terms of how they got into the system
2015-09-14T15:03:48 <Bosmon> Which would be quite ambitious
2015-09-14T15:03:52 * jhung1 joined the channel
2015-09-14T15:04:22 <Bosmon> THat is, "this value arose from defaults" whereas "this value arose from a distributed grade which then got entered into defaults" : P
2015-09-14T15:04:23 * kasparnet has quit
2015-09-14T15:04:28 <Bosmon> The difference between these last two is pretty subtle
2015-09-14T15:05:01 <Bosmon> And we can\'t really afford to pay attention to the initial values of the panels in general, since so many of their initial models are empty or unuseful
2015-09-14T15:05:23 <michelled1> danayo, sepidehshahi: we are starting the Floe planning meeting now
2015-09-14T15:05:29 * sepidehshahi has quit
2015-09-14T15:05:31 <danayo> ok michelled1

2015-09-14T15:53:41 <Justin_o> so far i like the nested structure better; however, for both i think we need to rethink the URLs. At least the names of them. We can talk more about this at the meeting today though.

2015-09-14T16:47:18 <cindyli> GENIUS Bosmon, ur suggestion is as helpful as always. overiding the initial model instead of directly into the panel model is the way to go
2015-09-14T16:48:35 <cindyli> thanks, Justin_o, btw, i like the flat structure more. yes, we can talk about it later in the meeting
2015-09-14T16:49:40 <Bosmon> cindyli - I\'ve been thinking about your original requirement and whether we can do something about it
2015-09-14T16:49:50 <Bosmon> I think it will be quite difficult but possible in the end
2015-09-14T16:50:08 <Bosmon> The resulting structure will be quite similar to the "localMergePolicy" we were discussing last week
2015-09-14T16:50:27 <Bosmon> It would be nice if there was a way to encode in a PARTICULAR GRADE that the model in it should be taken seriously : P
2015-09-14T16:50:47 <Bosmon> And this could help us get rid of a lot of the "liveOnly" etc. noise in our relay rules
2015-09-14T16:50:59 <Bosmon> Each individual source of models could be encoded with a kind of "priority"
2015-09-14T16:51:31 <Bosmon> Which means that the "initial transaction" would be much more like an ordered sequence of model applications rather than a huge fireball which appears to happen all at once
2015-09-14T16:51:43 <Bosmon> Although in practice it will still appear to happen all at once from the outside.....
2015-09-14T16:52:13 <Bosmon> So, for example, a grade could define an option named, for example, "modelPriority" which contained a "priority" definition very similar to the ones we now have on listeners etc.
2015-09-14T16:52:24 <Bosmon> And, mysteriously enough, this field would be NONINHERITABLE
2015-09-14T16:52:45 <Bosmon> This will be our first NONINHERITABLE field...... at least, since we got rid of "autoInit" which used to be the only noninheritable field in the system
2015-09-14T16:53:08 <Bosmon> Well.... actually I guess in practice there\'s no risk to allowing it to be inherited
2015-09-14T16:53:27 <Bosmon> Since someone who derives from the grade might well be happy with "the same" priority unless they wanted an even later one
2015-09-14T16:53:46 <Bosmon> BUT the key aspect is that the framework will be able to determine the EXACT GRADE in which this field was introduced
2015-09-14T16:54:03 <Bosmon> And so prioritise the PARTICULAR model material held in that grade, rather than just all merging it into a big soup
2015-09-14T16:54:57 * sepidehshahi has quit
2015-09-14T16:56:01 <cindyli> sounds very promising
2015-09-14T16:56:40 <cindyli> and a clearer and controllable work flow for constructing models
2015-09-14T16:58:03 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2015-09-14T16:58:17 <michelled> Bosmon: I was just doing some Floe organizing and it reminded me that we have a bunch of outstanding pull requests for UIO a11y work
2015-09-14T16:58:27 <michelled> are you planning on updating those pulls to the new framework?
2015-09-14T16:58:35 <Bosmon> michelled - I wasn\'t aware of them
2015-09-14T16:58:46 <michelled> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/611
2015-09-14T16:58:49 <Bosmon> Well, perhaps I was vaguely aware of them : P
2015-09-14T16:58:58 <Bosmon> But I think perhaps that cindyli had offered to take a go :)
2015-09-14T16:59:11 <cindyli> yes, i can take over
2015-09-14T16:59:24 <cindyli> once finishing off the first discovery tasks
2015-09-14T16:59:41 <cindyli> and Bosmon can review my changes
2015-09-14T16:59:41 <Bosmon> I think there should be almost zero conflicts
2015-09-14T16:59:46 <cindyli> YAY!!
2015-09-14T16:59:54 <Bosmon> Since I see that the change hits very little code and almost no component defs
2015-09-14T16:59:55 <cindyli> that means just a test and merge
2015-09-14T17:00:36 <cindyli> i\'ll seee
2015-09-14T17:00:45 <Bosmon> Yes, no references to "autoInit" in the diffs
2015-09-14T17:00:54 <michelled> cool, thx cindyli - if any of them seem more complex, please let me know
2015-09-14T17:00:58 <Bosmon> So I imagine that any conflicts will just be accidents resulting from moves around the file
2015-09-14T17:01:15 <cindyli> sure, michelled
2015-09-14T17:01:22 <Bosmon> Thanks, cindyli :)
2015-09-14T17:01:42 <cindyli> anytime, Bosmon.
2015-09-14T17:06:01 <michelled> Justin_o, Bosmon: it looks like this pull request should be put into the docs given that the accompanying code change has already gone in: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/pull/70
2015-09-14T17:06:20 <michelled> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/617
2015-09-14T17:06:27 <michelled> Bosmon: it looks like you made the code merge
2015-09-14T17:07:03 <Justin_o> michelled: i guess it probably needs to be review, but yes, should go in.
2015-09-14T17:07:05 <Bosmon> michelled - this pull will need updating
2015-09-14T17:07:13 <Bosmon> Since it refers to the "old framework" style
