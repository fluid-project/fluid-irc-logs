b'2015-03-25T18:27:15 <cindyli> Bosmon: seems it doesn\'t at the moment with the issue Justin_o described earlier
2015-03-25T18:27:15 * anastasiac is more interested in eating pies\xe2\x80\xa6 mmm\xe2\x80\xa6. apple...
2015-03-25T18:27:31 <colinclark> Bosmon: we do, except that the architecture meeting is pinned to Eurotime
2015-03-25T18:27:43 <Bosmon> cindyli - I guess you know what\'s coming next - could you make up a small test case demonstrating the issue :)
2015-03-25T18:27:45 <colinclark> and we\'re in daylight savings here in north america
2015-03-25T18:27:46 <Bosmon> colinclark - ah yes of course
2015-03-25T18:27:53 <Bosmon> The meetings originate in different communities :)
2015-03-25T18:27:53 <colinclark> are you in british summer time yet?
2015-03-25T18:27:56 <Bosmon> Ok, so yes, "last"
2015-03-25T18:27:59 <Bosmon> Not yet, coming this weekend
2015-03-25T18:28:03 <cindyli> sure, Bosmon
2015-03-25T18:28:20 <Bosmon> "last" just means "after all other listeners which have not been specified as \'last\'"
2015-03-25T18:28:28 <Bosmon> In that it represents an arbitrarily low priority
2015-03-25T18:28:42 <Bosmon> But I\'m sure you appreciate what an architectural hole this represents :)
2015-03-25T18:28:43 <colinclark> and in the case of two competing integrators who want to be last, what happens?
2015-03-25T18:28:45 <Bosmon> One day we will fix it
2015-03-25T18:28:48 <colinclark> :)
2015-03-25T18:29:02 <colinclark> Architectural holes are opportunities for future marvels
2015-03-25T18:29:04 <Bosmon> The winner of a "last" race is undefined
2015-03-25T18:29:13 <Bosmon> Which is why "last" should be used very sparingly
2015-03-25T18:29:19 <colinclark> ok
2015-03-25T18:29:23 <Bosmon> It\'s currently our equivalent for CSS !important : P
2015-03-25T18:29:30 <colinclark> For the case I\'m currently in, that works just fine
2015-03-25T18:29:40 <colinclark> it just occurred to me to wonder what really happened
2015-03-25T18:29:46 <Bosmon> Unfortunately there can often be races between, for example, the IoC testing framework\'s listeners, and implementors\' listeners
2015-03-25T18:29:54 <colinclark> the insane creator of this video compositing framework has "last" listener
2015-03-25T18:30:10 <colinclark> and I, as an integrator, want to register a grade that injects "debugging" listeners
2015-03-25T18:30:12 <Bosmon> The fix is JIRAed at http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5506
2015-03-25T18:30:18 <Bosmon> colinclark - yes, this case is classic
2015-03-25T18:30:28 <colinclark> but as far as I can tell, neither of really depends on absolutely being last
2015-03-25T18:30:49 <colinclark> ok, cool
2015-03-25T18:30:52 <Bosmon> I suggest that what the insane compositing framework author does is simply substitute a fixed large number for "last"
2015-03-25T18:30:57 <colinclark> ah yes, I remember this JIRA
2015-03-25T18:31:11 <Bosmon> You\'ve noticed the appearance of large round numbers, for example, in our GPII preferences processing pipeline : P
2015-03-25T18:31:12 * sepideh has quit
2015-03-25T18:31:15 <colinclark> yes
2015-03-25T18:31:20 <colinclark> I suspect this developer actually doesn\'t really need to be last
2015-03-25T18:31:30 <Bosmon> And the atavistic use of these 1980s-style numbers is our current "best practice" for problems like this
2015-03-25T18:31:41 <colinclark> ok
2015-03-25T18:31:46 <colinclark> this is cool
2015-03-25T18:31:50 <Bosmon> Every time I am in a particularly boring concert I speculate about how the algorithm would work for FLUID-5506 :)
2015-03-25T18:31:55 <colinclark> It really is a simple thing...
2015-03-25T18:32:03 <colinclark> but it\'s so great to be able to do this with a great
2015-03-25T18:32:05 <colinclark> I can have a thing
2015-03-25T18:32:10 <colinclark> and then I can create this debugging grade
2015-03-25T18:32:13 <colinclark> and add it when I\'m debugging
2015-03-25T18:32:17 <colinclark> and remove it in production
2015-03-25T18:32:23 <colinclark> with ABSOLUTELY NO CODE CHANGES
2015-03-25T18:32:25 <Bosmon> Yes
2015-03-25T18:32:32 <Bosmon> Much like how my MEGGER DEMMO worked
2015-03-25T18:32:38 <colinclark> Simple, but marvellous
2015-03-25T18:32:46 <Bosmon> One day, we will be able to "remove it in production"....... LIVE!
2015-03-25T18:32:51 <colinclark> yes!
2015-03-25T18:32:58 <Bosmon> That is, take a running system, and temporarily inject the grades into it
2015-03-25T18:33:00 <Bosmon> And then remove them
2015-03-25T18:33:11 <Bosmon> but this will merely require the creation of a kind of system that THE WORLD HAS NEVER YET SEEN
2015-03-25T18:33:12 <colinclark> yes, that is exactly what I want
2015-03-25T18:33:32 <Bosmon> One in which ALL CONSTRUCTIONAL SEMANTICS HAVE BEEN REDUCED TO STATE
2015-03-25T18:33:37 <colinclark> when I\'m panicking, certain that one of my insane upstream framework creators has done something non-performant, I can just inject the grade and see
2015-03-25T18:33:39 <colinclark> and then turn it off again
2015-03-25T18:34:00 <Bosmon> Yes well, those upstream creators are constantly creating performance traps
2015-03-25T18:34:20 <colinclark> It\'s a good thing I have them to blame
2015-03-25T18:34:21 <Bosmon> I was just thinking on my RUNE last night about what it means that your profile view declared that those framework functions "could not be optimised"
2015-03-25T18:34:33 <Bosmon> I mean, clearly they are entirely megamorphic
2015-03-25T18:34:37 <colinclark> yes
2015-03-25T18:34:54 <Bosmon> Since if you ask, "What kinds of types pass through these functions", the answer has to be "every type in the system"
2015-03-25T18:35:08 <Bosmon> But does this actually imply that no function, for example, making use of function.apply can be optimised?
2015-03-25T18:35:18 <Bosmon> I guess it all depends on the amount of type variation involved
2015-03-25T18:35:38 <Bosmon> But our framework will always have several sites in it that are "infinitely megamorphic" - in that every possible type in the system can be dispatched through them
2015-03-25T18:36:42 <colinclark> yes, I guess that\'s true
2015-03-25T18:37:09 <Bosmon> And so if that is what the "can not be optimised" icon is trying to convey, we could never expect to get rid of it
2015-03-25T18:37:42 <colinclark> I think the best way to find out is to enable the crazy optimization debugging output in Chrome and then watch my leaf flicker for a while
2015-03-25T18:37:48 <Bosmon> But megamorphicity needn\'t be an absolute performance killer, all it means is that the site needs to use hashtable semantics to look up dispatches rather than searching a short linked list
2015-03-25T18:38:32 <Bosmon> Perhaps a very nice future JSVM will allow us to "synthesize code" for invokers, the way bytecode manipulation allowed in a JVM
2015-03-25T18:38:46 <Bosmon> I guess, perhaps, (horrors) the best way out actually involves the use of "eval"
2015-03-25T18:39:03 <Bosmon> We can perform the same profiling that the JSVM performs, and identify particularly "hot" invokers
2015-03-25T18:39:14 <Bosmon> And then synthesize hard-baked dispatch code for them, and "eval" it : P
2015-03-25T18:39:19 <colinclark> yes
2015-03-25T18:39:58 <danaayotte> hey fluid-everyone is community meeting happening in vidyo fluid standup room?
2015-03-25T18:40:20 <colinclark> what is the plan for the community meeting today?
2015-03-25T18:40:57 <Justin_o> I believe it will be a brainstorming meeting on sonification
2015-03-25T18:41:11 <Justin_o> lliskovoi: is it still happening?
2015-03-25T18:41:33 * lliskovoi has quit
2015-03-25T18:42:05 <colinclark> i\'ll go set up Vidyo in the other room
2015-03-25T18:46:07 <colinclark> Bosmon: do you want to join us to brainstorm too
2015-03-25T18:46:08 <colinclark> ?
2015-03-25T18:46:15 <Bosmon> colinclark - certainly, yes
2015-03-25T18:46:20 <colinclark> we\'re in vidyo
2015-03-25T19:11:48 <simonjb> Bosmon: the jQuery UI "widget" accessor appears to work just fine
2015-03-25T19:12:00 <simonjb> Bosmon: I\'ve just pushed my change -- https://github.com/simonbates/universal/commit/80aeea214238ca8c02e8674d6f28cf0646de5dc2
2015-03-25T19:12:46 <Bosmon> simonjb - that looks great!
2015-03-25T19:12:47 <simonjb> Bosmon: the change is much smaller than this diff looks like (I changed a lot of whitespace as I no longer needed the enclosing "(function ($) {"
2015-03-25T19:13:26 <simonjb> Bosmon: the widget is passed as a property on the fired createDialogWidget event
2015-03-25T19:14:10 <simonjb> Bosmon: should I move any of this to the component itself (rather than just existing in the test version)?
2015-03-25T19:14:20 <Bosmon> simonjb - yes, I think the event should be moved up into the component
2015-03-25T19:14:38 <simonjb> Bosmon: and leave the registeding of the buttons in the test?
2015-03-25T19:15:11 <michelled> danaayotte: are you in a meeting at this point?
2015-03-25T19:15:22 <Bosmon> I think the buttons should go up into the main component too
2015-03-25T19:15:25 <danaayotte> i\'m in the community meeting michelled
2015-03-25T19:15:31 <Bosmon> As well as a listener which attaches the "widget" itself as a top-level member too
2015-03-25T19:15:49 <simonjb> Bosmon: ok, will make those changes
2015-03-25T19:15:49 <michelled> ok, cool danaayotte - we\'ll connect later
2015-03-25T19:15:52 <michelled> or tomorrow
2015-03-25T19:16:05 <simonjb> Bosmon: the way that I am fired the event is ok?
2015-03-25T19:18:04 <danaayotte> ok great michelled. i\'ll let you know when we\'re done
2015-03-25T19:19:02 <Bosmon> simonjb - I think it\'s ok, yes
2015-03-25T19:19:28 <simonjb> great, thanks Bosmon -- will make these updates now
2015-03-25T19:19:29 <Bosmon> In practice we should do something better about trying to merge any existing "create" option, but we\'re a bit pressed for time
2015-03-25T19:19:47 <Bosmon> We\'ll rationalise this all into a generalised scheme for all jQuery UI widgets once we have more time
2015-03-25T19:19:58 <simonjb> sounds good

2015-03-25T21:42:13 <Bosmon> simonjb - that\'s fine, no worries!

2015-03-25T16:53:25 * jessm has quit
2015-03-25T16:54:04 <Justin_o> michelled: okay
2015-03-25T16:56:37 <Justin_o> cindyli: it\'s still failing for me with the following model values from the logging model listener
2015-03-25T16:56:42 <Justin_o> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/nwXVhfiK
2015-03-25T16:57:22 <cindyli> Justin_o: which browser do you use? did you clear the cache
2015-03-25T16:57:43 <Justin_o> safari and it should be, the values were different before
2015-03-25T16:57:47 <Justin_o> i\'ll try with chrome
2015-03-25T16:57:51 <cindyli> trying again from scratch
2015-03-25T16:59:29 <cindyli> Justin_o: works for me, do a "git status" to make sure there are no other changes
2015-03-25T17:02:02 <Justin_o> cindyli: those are the only changes.. it worked in chrome and a private window of safari.. it also worked in safari when just running the "Text Size" test alone, but not when running the First Discovery Test
2015-03-25T17:02:18 <Justin_o> i emptied the cache a few times.. i\'ll try restarting the browser now
2015-03-25T17:02:29 <cindyli> weird, trying all-tests.html on safari
2015-03-25T17:03:08 <Justin_o> it\'s working after the browser restart
2015-03-25T17:03:41 <cindyli> yay!!
2015-03-25T17:03:44 <Justin_o> cindyli: we should talk to Bosmon about why "value" versus value would make a difference
2015-03-25T17:04:05 <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks for figuring that out too
2015-03-25T17:05:24 <cindyli> np, Justin_o, probably the fact that modelListeners block is not yet supporting namespaces is part of the issue. not yet parsing keys from pure strings
2015-03-25T17:05:48 <Justin_o> could be
2015-03-25T17:05:56 <Justin_o> cindyli: could you also code review https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/590 for me
2015-03-25T17:06:09 <Justin_o> michelled:  started to look at it last week
2015-03-25T17:06:27 <Justin_o> cindyli: ^ meant that michelled had started looking at it last week
2015-03-25T17:07:22 <cindyli> ok. i can join the review, Justin_o
2015-03-25T17:07:32 <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks
2015-03-25T17:07:36 <cindyli> np
2015-03-25T17:07:41 <Justin_o> we\'ll need that to go into master before this pull can really be done
2015-03-25T17:07:52 <cindyli> understand
2015-03-25T17:07:55 <Justin_o> thanks

2015-03-25T17:19:22 <anastasiac> cindyli, I\xe2\x80\x99ve made changes and comments in response to your uio-wp-plugin feedback
2015-03-25T17:19:42 <cindyli> thanks, anastasiac, will take a look soon
2015-03-25T17:39:28 <cindyli> anastasiac: i left a few more comments in ur pull request for uio-wp-plugin
2015-03-25T17:39:38 <anastasiac> thanks, cindyli
2015-03-25T17:39:43 <cindyli> np
2015-03-25T17:41:05 <Bosmon> Thanks for the merge, Justin_o :)
2015-03-25T17:41:11 <Bosmon> What was the issue relating to "value" from earlier?
2015-03-25T17:45:37 <Justin_o> Bosmon: no problem, can http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5489 be closed now?
2015-03-25T17:46:59 <Justin_o> Bosmon: for "value" before.. if this model listener https://github.com/jobara/first-discovery/blob/FLOE-280-infusion/src/js/panels.js#L89 was written as "value" instead, the model default model wasn\'t passed along
2015-03-25T17:47:25 <Justin_o> Bosmon: that\'s use model relay components in the prefsFramework
2015-03-25T17:47:39 <Bosmon> Justin_o - that\'s impossible!
2015-03-25T17:47:49 <Justin_o> Bosmon: that\'s what I would have thought too
2015-03-25T17:51:29 <Justin_o> cindyli, Bosmon: I can\'t reproduce that the "value" vs value thing now.. so maybe there was a caching issue before when we commented out the model in the ranged panel
2015-03-25T17:51:35 <Bosmon> Justin_o - right
2015-03-25T17:51:39 <Bosmon> The behaviour you observed was impossible
2015-03-25T17:52:07 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i would think that keys are always treated as strings when accessed internally
2015-03-25T17:53:07 <Bosmon> Justin_o - right - the JSON values represented by the two alternatives are identical
2015-03-25T17:54:05 <anastasiac> cindyli: the wp plugin is ready for another look
2015-03-25T17:54:33 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I\'d like to see https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/577 merged in before we close out FLUID-5489
2015-03-25T17:54:41 <cindyli> Justin_o, Bosmon, i cannot reproduce the problem by removing quotes around "value", but the problem can be reproduced with the default model value being set to null
2015-03-25T17:54:50 <cindyli> sure, anastasiac, will take a look
2015-03-25T17:55:21 <cindyli> Justin_o: i also left a minor comment for ur pull for the tooltip component - https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/590
2015-03-25T17:55:35 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay, thanks, could you make a note of that on the FLUID-5489 jira
2015-03-25T18:21:20 <michelled> ok, anastasiac, cindyli, Justin_o: vidyo? I\'ll open my room
2015-03-25T18:21:24 * kasparnet has quit
2015-03-25T18:23:46 <michelled> cindyli?
2015-03-25T18:24:18 <Bosmon> cindyli - if the default model is set to null, what kind of behaviour would you expect to observe from its being "passed along"?
2015-03-25T18:25:20 <cindyli> Bosmon: i expect the relayed value will override the null
2015-03-25T18:26:00 <Bosmon> cindyli - and you find it doesn\'t?
2015-03-25T18:26:19 <colinclark> Bosmon: Can I ask you a sort of stupid question about priorities at some point when you\'re free?
2015-03-25T18:26:25 <Bosmon> colinclark - I am free!
2015-03-25T18:26:31 <Bosmon> I assume the community meeting is 1 hr from now
2015-03-25T18:26:42 <colinclark> I think it might be in four minutes
2015-03-25T18:26:44 <Bosmon> I\'m interested in SONNIFYING PIES :)
2015-03-25T18:26:45 <Bosmon> !!!!!!
2015-03-25T18:27:04 <colinclark> I wonder what it means for someone to declare a priority of "last"
2015-03-25T18:27:14 <Bosmon> I was sure we used to have 90 minutes between end of arch and start of community....
