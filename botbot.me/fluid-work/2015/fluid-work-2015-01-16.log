b'2015-01-16T18:08:34 <colinclark> so as along as MobileAccessibility is able to handle this output, we should be ok
2015-01-16T18:08:41 <colinclark> assuming I\'m understanding the issue correctly
2015-01-16T18:08:57 <Justin_o> colinclark: okay cook, it doesn\'t show your actual preferences though it will always output some value which may or may not have been your actual setting
2015-01-16T18:09:05 <Justin_o> cool
2015-01-16T18:09:06 <Bosmon7> You should take care though, to reorder the clauses in the old transform so that the value which is output in the case of undefined input really does coincide with the "default value" of the application
2015-01-16T18:09:09 <Bosmon7> Which I assume is 0
2015-01-16T18:09:28 <Justin_o> Bosmon7, colinclark: simonjb is talking it over with them right now
2015-01-16T18:09:34 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - great
2015-01-16T18:10:13 <colinclark> excellent
2015-01-16T18:10:25 <Justin_o> Bosmon7, colinclark: i assume once the review is done and Bosmon7\'s branch is in, we\'ll be able to fix this.
2015-01-16T18:10:43 <Bosmon7> In future we need to have "baseline tests" for every solution in the registry, which verify that its transformation produces no output in the case of no input
2015-01-16T18:10:59 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - right
2015-01-16T18:11:20 <Bosmon7> Unfortunately the fix to the valueMapper has the potential to hit the behaviour of numerous parts of the system
2015-01-16T18:11:28 <Bosmon7> So I think we can\'t afford to merge it now
2015-01-16T18:12:09 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: i agree, especially since that would change infusion for everything.. it seem really dangerous to do at this point
2015-01-16T18:12:24 <Bosmon7> I had been fixing up the same issue with all the other solutions that we\'d been working with for the filtering
2015-01-16T18:12:48 <Bosmon7> I had fixed up cloud4chrome myself, and when simonjb started working with easit4all we fixed up its transformations together
2015-01-16T18:13:07 <Bosmon7> But unfortunately this transform for MA is too hard to fix up with the valueMapper bug in place
2015-01-16T18:14:08 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: at least it\'s only one, you guys did a good job with all the rest
2015-01-16T18:18:35 <simonjb> ok guys, just asked Ferran and he said it is fine if access_commonprefs_editingkeyboardecho is always returned
2015-01-16T18:19:39 <simonjb> he said that in the future it would be preferable if the value was filtered out but for the demo next week it is fine and will not have a negative affect
2015-01-16T18:19:49 <simonjb> Justin_o, colinclark, Bosmon7^
2015-01-16T18:20:23 <Justin_o> simonjb: that\'s great, yes, post review we expect to have it properly cleaned up
2015-01-16T18:22:07 <colinclark> yup, seems reasonable
2015-01-16T18:23:11 <Bosmon7> simonjb - Great, thanks very much for mediating with Ferran on this
2015-01-16T18:23:37 <simonjb> he also said generally that things are looking good that he is able to use our APIs from MA and can get the settings for the test users
2015-01-16T18:24:02 <simonjb> he said that the only thing he didn\'t test yet was revoking
2015-01-16T18:24:32 <simonjb> we said maybe on Monday to test that once he is in Luxembourg
2015-01-16T18:24:53 <simonjb> Justin_o, colinclark, Bosmon7^
2015-01-16T18:25:13 <Bosmon7> simonjb - oops - this makes me remember that I didn\'t actually put revocation tests into my test sequences as I had been planning
2015-01-16T18:25:18 <Bosmon7> I knew I had forgotten something
2015-01-16T18:25:34 <colinclark> ok, that sounds reasonable simonjb
2015-01-16T18:25:34 <Bosmon7> I\'ll try and put this in tomorrow
2015-01-16T18:25:38 <colinclark> i\'m glad he\'ll be there to do the demo
2015-01-16T18:25:45 <simonjb> me too
2015-01-16T18:26:36 <simonjb> colinclark: I\'ll start the day early on Monday so I\'ll be available if anything comes up once you are all together trying things
2015-01-16T18:28:01 <colinclark> ok great
2015-01-16T18:28:08 <colinclark> that\'s very kind of you, simonjb

2015-01-16T17:14:37 <Justin_o> Bosmon: remember the issue with web.json that we talked about yesterday, regarding transformations. cindy wrote something up that worked in test she made but didn\'t work with the filtering. where should i go to debug this?
2015-01-16T17:18:37 * Bosmon7 joined the channel
2015-01-16T17:19:43 <Bosmon7> Hi Justin_o
2015-01-16T17:19:54 <Bosmon7> can you be more specific about what you mean by "doesn\'t work with the filtering"?
2015-01-16T17:20:03 <Bosmon7> And how is what is tested in the test case different from what is tested in the filtering?
2015-01-16T17:20:15 <Bosmon7> Perhaps you can also paste some examples of what you and cindyli came up with
2015-01-16T17:21:02 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: sure.. this is what cindy tested with http://pastebin.com/L0MCW9Bx
2015-01-16T17:21:34 <Justin_o> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/mgXnnVwv
2015-01-16T17:22:21 <Bosmon7> Looks like her testcase 5 tests what is required
2015-01-16T17:22:47 <Justin_o> when run with security the preference is never returned regardless of whether we share the preferences or not
2015-01-16T17:24:00 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - what you\'ve written there looks reasonable
2015-01-16T17:24:17 <Bosmon7> Have you committed this to a branch so we can look at the whole thing?
2015-01-16T17:24:31 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: not yet, but i can do that.. just be one minute
2015-01-16T17:25:43 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - one useful point in the workflow is at https://github.com/simonbates/universal/blob/GPII-17/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/src/CloudBasedFlowManager.js#L184
2015-01-16T17:25:53 <Bosmon7> As you can see there is still a huge amount of debugging in this function
2015-01-16T17:25:59 <Bosmon7> So you should be able to see something going by in the logs
2015-01-16T17:26:15 <Bosmon7> To start with you should check to see whether the relevent preference makes it as far as the beginning of this function
2015-01-16T17:26:31 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: i\'ve pushed this up to https://github.com/jobara/universal/tree/GPII-17-transformation
2015-01-16T17:26:56 * Sepideh has quit
2015-01-16T17:27:11 <Bosmon7> If it makes it as far as the end of that function, the next crucial workflow point is in the transformer here:
2015-01-16T17:27:12 <Bosmon7> https://github.com/simonbates/universal/blob/GPII-17/gpii/node_modules/transformer/src/js/Transformer.js#L45

2015-01-16T17:28:42 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: thanks.. i\'ll take a look in those places
2015-01-16T17:29:30 <Bosmon7> Ok Justin_o, "by eye" your problem seems to be this -
2015-01-16T17:29:51 <Bosmon7> You have picked a name for your setting "access_commonprefs_editingkeyboardecho" which doesn\'t seem to appear anywhere in your ontology
2015-01-16T17:30:03 <Justin_o> :(
2015-01-16T17:30:12 <Bosmon7> As I mentioned yesterday, if your ontology is incomplete, it will cause the relevant setting to not be transmitted
2015-01-16T17:30:55 <Bosmon7> It\'s odd, since I wonder how you performed the testing for this filtering, without having a setting for it : P
2015-01-16T17:30:57 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: it outputs values without the change to the transformation though
2015-01-16T17:31:07 <Bosmon7> But perhaps it is in the UI without being in the ontology
2015-01-16T17:31:37 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: we are mapping the keyEcho and wordEcho to it
2015-01-16T17:31:42 <Justin_o> which are in the ontology
2015-01-16T17:31:59 <Bosmon7> Oh I see
2015-01-16T17:32:00 <Bosmon7> Just a second
2015-01-16T17:32:24 <Justin_o> sure
2015-01-16T17:35:50 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - sure, ignore what I just said, I had become completely confused
2015-01-16T17:36:01 <Bosmon7> I think the transform looks faulty, in that it mentions inputPath: ""
2015-01-16T17:36:02 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: :) no problem..
2015-01-16T17:36:27 <Bosmon7> I would try removing both inputPath and defaultOutputPath from that transform and see if it makes a difference
2015-01-16T17:36:49 <Bosmon7> But the best place to look in the code will be at the 2nd link I pasted, in Transformer.js
2015-01-16T17:37:07 <Bosmon7> You should log the input payload as well as the transform, and see if there seems to be a good reason for the value to have gone missing
2015-01-16T17:38:31 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: okay, i\'ll look at that. and removing the inputPath and defaultOutputPath didn\'t seem to have any effect
2015-01-16T17:39:03 <Bosmon7> The transform that cindyli has written in the test case seems to assume that it is writing to the model root
2015-01-16T17:43:34 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: i guess it\'s supposed to be writing the root of the property the transform is attached to
2015-01-16T17:43:38 <Justin_o> is that correct?
2015-01-16T17:44:30 * Sepideh has quit
2015-01-16T17:45:05 * Sepideh joined the channel
2015-01-16T17:46:44 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - well it should, yes
2015-01-16T17:47:04 <Bosmon7> One would hope this is the way the system is implemented, but it would help if we had written up the documentation to remind us
2015-01-16T17:47:15 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: i put in a break point in gpii.transformer.transformOneSettingsHandler. The input looks correct, but the inferred object is assigned an object with the property missing
2015-01-16T17:47:26 <Justin_o> :)
2015-01-16T17:47:27 <Bosmon7> breakpoint!
2015-01-16T17:47:34 <Justin_o> node inspector
2015-01-16T17:47:36 <Bosmon7> I hadn\'t realised these things were still possible :)
2015-01-16T17:47:46 <Bosmon7> If you\'d put in a log statement, you could have pasted me the output :)
2015-01-16T17:47:56 <Justin_o> :) sure i\'ll do that
2015-01-16T17:50:50 <Bosmon7> I suspect that my keyboard is starting to wear out with the number of times I\'ve typed in JSON.stringify(x, null, 2) in the last few months
2015-01-16T17:51:34 <Bosmon7> Somehow it never seems to seem QUITE enough to justify writing a dedicated function for it
2015-01-16T17:51:50 <Bosmon7> And it is barely more keystrokes than it takes to write fluid.prettyPrintJSON(x)
2015-01-16T17:51:55 <Justin_o> what does null, 2 do?
2015-01-16T17:52:13 <Bosmon7> Without those arguments, you get the output all crammed into a one-line string without any whitespace
2015-01-16T17:52:22 <Bosmon7> 2 indents by 2....

2015-01-16T17:55:41 <Bosmon7> Perhaps the reason I haven\'t been able to run node-inspector for so long was that I was stuck on node 0.8.x
2015-01-16T17:55:48 <Bosmon7> I guess I should try it again someday
2015-01-16T17:56:49 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: so i have some console logs
2015-01-16T17:56:54 <Justin_o> this is the input payload
2015-01-16T17:56:55 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - cool
2015-01-16T17:57:04 <Justin_o> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/WvWRkcTC
2015-01-16T17:57:26 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: this is what the transformation produces
2015-01-16T17:57:30 <Justin_o> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/iFgMQNIQ
2015-01-16T17:57:53 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - well, that\'s very strange
2015-01-16T17:58:13 <Bosmon7> I suggest you go back to the test case and try to make it more realistic
2015-01-16T17:58:24 <Bosmon7> And make the input and output payloads more identical to the required ones
2015-01-16T17:58:58 <Bosmon7> oh!
2015-01-16T17:59:01 <Bosmon7> I think I know the reason
2015-01-16T17:59:07 <Bosmon7> The transform is taking the ENTIRE MODEL as input
2015-01-16T17:59:17 <Bosmon7> Which of course doesn\'t match any of its input models

2015-01-16T18:00:56 <Bosmon7> oh dear
2015-01-16T18:01:00 <Bosmon7> This is less fun than I thought
2015-01-16T18:01:05 <Bosmon7> Since the relevant pull request has still not been revied
2015-01-16T18:01:07 <Bosmon7> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/572
2015-01-16T18:01:08 <Bosmon7> reviewed
2015-01-16T18:02:26 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: that\'s unfortunate
2015-01-16T18:02:34 <Bosmon7> Unfortunately I don\'t think we can afford to have a pull request this sensitive integrated in 1 day before giving a major demo
2015-01-16T18:02:39 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: so you think that the problem is related to comparing the models, actually that makes sense
2015-01-16T18:02:43 <Bosmon7> I\'m just conferring with colinclark now
2015-01-16T18:02:45 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: i agree
2015-01-16T18:02:47 <colinclark> eek
2015-01-16T18:02:56 <Justin_o> i\'m pretty sure simonjb would agree that it\'s too late too :)
2015-01-16T18:02:59 <colinclark> It started with "SO, YOU\'RE DOING THE DEMO!"
2015-01-16T18:03:01 <colinclark> :)
2015-01-16T18:03:02 <Bosmon7> hahaha
2015-01-16T18:03:24 <Justin_o> haha
2015-01-16T18:04:38 <Justin_o> Bosmon7, colinclark, simonjb: I think it\'s probably best then to just have it return a value all the time and try to have the integrators work around it. at least for the review
2015-01-16T18:06:10 <colinclark> The problem with that is then we\'re leaking information, Justin_o
2015-01-16T18:07:10 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - yes, we are just talking over whether that would be viable
2015-01-16T18:07:13 <Bosmon7> it looks like it probably is
2015-01-16T18:07:36 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: thanks
2015-01-16T18:07:52 <colinclark> In principle, it\'s a real problem
2015-01-16T18:07:58 <colinclark> since if you as a user says "don\'t share my screen reader settings"
2015-01-16T18:08:10 <colinclark> then you don\'t want the system to accidentally reveal that you have such settings
2015-01-16T18:08:22 <colinclark> but i think in practice, we won\'t be showing the underlying payloads in the demonstration
