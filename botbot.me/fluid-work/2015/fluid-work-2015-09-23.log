2015-09-23T13:45:25 <cindyli> anastasiac: as you know, the chart authoring tool uses D3 library to draw pie chart. alanharnum and I have a js file to do d3 related operations - https://github.com/cindyli/chartAuthoring/blob/FLOE-404/src/js/utils.js. please ignore the last function gpii.isCssClass(). it will be moved to somewhere else. the question is, this file name "utils.js" probably is not a very good name since it misleads developers to put all sort of utility functions in her

2015-09-23T14:04:07 <alanharnum> d3utils would make sense to me

2015-09-23T15:44:32 <avtar> i\'d be interested to hear about your experience if you\'ve used either or both
2015-09-23T15:44:56 <avtar> or any other solutions

2015-09-23T15:48:54 <Justin_o> avtar: it looks like this is what grunt watch plugin uses https://www.npmjs.com/package/gaze
2015-09-23T15:53:46 <avtar> thanks, Justin_o. i\'ll add it to the list, although the other two projects seem to be more ready to use by something like systemd

2015-09-23T16:07:05 <Justin_o> i don\'t think i got it ;(
2015-09-23T16:07:09 <Justin_o> where did you send it to?
2015-09-23T16:08:00 <avtar> i tested this on my work computer yesterday and was able to bring up a vm. if you could confirm then once i add process watching i\'ll create a repo for idi-ops
2015-09-23T16:08:04 <avtar> oh
2015-09-23T16:08:11 <avtar> to your work email

2015-09-23T16:12:58 <anastasiac> alanharnum: you were going to show me the demo you have for the chart stuff. Do you have a branch I could pull down and play with?
2015-09-23T16:14:04 <alanharnum> anastasiac: https://github.com/waharnum/chartAuthoring/tree/FLOE-418
2015-09-23T16:14:19 <anastasiac> thanks, alanharnum, I\xe2\x80\x99ll have a look
2015-09-23T16:14:42 <alanharnum> there\'s two demos in there, one for the full authoring component, the second for an accessible pie chart (which I\'m mostly using for testing screen reader behaviour)
2015-09-23T16:15:02 <anastasiac> gotcha
2015-09-23T16:47:05 <anastasiac> alanharnum: the demos look great. What screen readers have you tested with, and what should I expect from the chart demo as far as speech is concerned?
2015-09-23T16:48:09 <alanharnum> anastasiac: i\'ve been testing with VoiceOver on OS X; basically, you should expect the pie charts to be described as though they were static images with alt text (at the moment)
2015-09-23T16:48:36 <alanharnum> even though they\'re composed of multiple SVG paths and text elements based on input data
2015-09-23T16:48:52 <anastasiac> alanharnum, what should I be doing to prompt that description to occur?
2015-09-23T16:50:06 <alanharnum> having the screenreader read the document from the beginning should be sufficient - it should encounter the pie chart as an "image" and read the title/description as, basically, alt text

2015-09-23T16:52:18 <anastasiac> ok, got it

2015-09-23T16:59:07 <anastasiac> alanharnum: these demos are great. they\xe2\x80\x99re definitely worth getting up on the build site, even if they\xe2\x80\x99re not perfect wrt a11y (I\xe2\x80\x99m making some notes on that). I would recommend adding the Overlay to them, to explain what they\xe2\x80\x99re all about, but other than that, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we should wait
2015-09-23T16:59:15 <anastasiac> alanharnum: are you familiar with the overlay panel?
2015-09-23T16:59:45 <anastasiac> overview, not overlay
2015-09-23T16:59:58 <anastasiac> the grey panel on the left: http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/overviewPanel/
2015-09-23T17:00:00 <alanharnum> anastasiac: somewhat, yeah, from my surveys of existing Infusion components
2015-09-23T17:00:15 <alanharnum> a11y notes would be great
2015-09-23T17:02:06 <anastasiac> alanharnum: adding the overview panel should be very simple - it\xe2\x80\x99s all just string configuration, basically. You\xe2\x80\x99ll just need to make sure your copy of infusion has that component in it. A quick look at any of the demos that use it should show you how to add it
2015-09-23T17:02:32 <alanharnum> anastasiac: yeah should be straightforward - i\'ll add that to my list of things
2015-09-23T17:03:12 <anastasiac> but other than that, alanharnum, don\xe2\x80\x99t worry about implementing any more before getting them onto the build site
2015-09-23T17:04:16 <alanharnum> anstasiac: ok, so with an overview panel implemented, the demos are good to go once we have the dependent code in. excellent. thanks anastasiac
2015-09-23T17:04:45 <anastasiac> my pleasure. I\xe2\x80\x99ll send an email with notes from my a11y revie
2015-09-23T17:06:59 <anastasiac> alanharnum, cindyli: Do we have an ETA for when the chartAuthoring stuff might be merged? We\xe2\x80\x99ll need to ping avtar and gtirloni about getting it deployed so that the build site can link to it
2015-09-23T17:08:08 <alanharnum> anastasiac: it will be a few days at least i think
2015-09-23T17:08:45 <alanharnum> FLOE-404 and FLOE-412 are both ahead of FLOE-418 as dependencies
2015-09-23T17:09:54 <anastasiac> ok, thanks alanharnum
