2015-05-21T20:57:06 <danaayotte> I think the hand looks a bit too much like "stop"
2015-05-21T20:57:32 <danaayotte> perhaps we could use instead (what I think is) the more common "OK" looking symbol?

2015-05-21T13:25:47 <Justin_o> cindyli, Bosmon: I left a reply to the comments on the FLOE-346 pull about using the fluid.transforms.binaryOp transform.
2015-05-21T13:26:41 <cindyli> thanks, Justin_o. what\'s "the problem with the floating point inaccuracy"?
2015-05-21T13:26:50 <Justin_o> however I don\'t think i could use that since the values i\'m getting back for min are 0.2 and 0.20000000000000004 because of the floating point
2015-05-21T13:27:19 <Justin_o> which is why i switched to use fluid.model.isSameValue, which handles that discrpency
2015-05-21T13:27:31 <Bosmon> Justin_o - the framework automatically uses fluid.model.isSameValue when comparing models
2015-05-21T13:27:36 <Bosmon> in fact, this is why the utility was written :)
2015-05-21T13:28:46 <Justin_o> Bosmon: but this transformation requires you to pass in the operator http://wiki.gpii.net/w/Architecture_-_Available_transformation_functions#Binary_operation_.28fluid.transforms.binaryOp.29
2015-05-21T13:28:56 <Justin_o> does it use the one you pass in or the utility?
2015-05-21T13:29:29 <Bosmon> Justin_o - the internal machinery of the ChangeApplier considers always that two values which pass fluid.model.isSameValue are the same, regardless of what transformation rule you are using
2015-05-21T13:30:01 <Bosmon> Hmm
2015-05-21T13:30:05 <Bosmon> Just a second
2015-05-21T13:30:08 <Bosmon> I have a bit of a thick head today
2015-05-21T13:31:12 <simonjb> Hi Bosmon, would you be available for a chat with cindyli and myself about the First Discovery tool?
2015-05-21T13:32:23 <Bosmon> Sorry, you\'re right - I\'ll write a JIRA to make sure that the implementation of the === binOp is fixed
2015-05-21T13:32:27 <Bosmon> simonjb - sure
2015-05-21T13:33:20 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks... what should i do for now.. should i keep it as is.. or use a free transform or something to try to still use the modelRelay?
2015-05-21T13:34:26 <Bosmon> Justin_o - Yes, I guess the free transform is a reasonable idea - it\'s hardly much less readable than the binOp anyway, given our cumbersome syntax : P
2015-05-21T13:34:35 <Bosmon> I\'ll give you the JIRA number in a second that you can add to a comment
2015-05-21T13:34:46 <Justin_o> Bosmon: cool, thanks

2015-05-21T14:31:49 <Justin_o> Bosmon: there\'s a slightly funny thing that happened. On init the update of the buttons needs to happen afterRender but on changes, it can happen on modelChange of the isMax and isMin model values
2015-05-21T14:32:13 <Justin_o> i\'m just going to make everything work afterRender, but wondering why it worked in one case but not the other
2015-05-21T14:32:58 <Bosmon> Hi Justin_o
2015-05-21T14:33:09 <Bosmon> Can you explain what you mean by "On init the update of the buttons needs to happen afterRender"?
2015-05-21T14:33:29 <Justin_o> Bosmon: so this relates to the comment from FLOE-346 to use the model relay
2015-05-21T14:33:46 <Justin_o> what it was triggering is setting the disabled property on the increase and decrease buttons
2015-05-21T14:33:57 <Justin_o> when the value is at either bound
2015-05-21T14:34:03 <Bosmon> yes
2015-05-21T14:34:42 <Justin_o> when the component is initialized, if we just have the modelListeners for isMax and isMin to set the property, the buttons aren\'t updated. They are updated properly on changes from interacting with the adjuster though
2015-05-21T14:35:13 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I assume they are not updated because they haven\'t been rendered yet?
2015-05-21T14:35:34 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes, i expect so too, but why do they work in the live case where they are rerendered as well
2015-05-21T14:35:50 <Justin_o> is it just some timing thing with modelListeners?
2015-05-21T14:36:33 <Justin_o> Bosmon: by the way, do you have the Jira number for that other issue?
2015-05-21T14:36:44 <Bosmon> Justin_o - still not yet, sorry - in the middle of writing another long JIRA...
2015-05-21T14:36:48 * michelled has quit
2015-05-21T14:37:13 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay, i\'ll hold off on committing this change for now, please let me know when you have it
2015-05-21T14:38:15 <Bosmon> I\'m not sure about the timing issue - I guess until we have the constraint-based listener system in trunk, it will be hard to control which things occur before and after other things (although we could write priorities on them)
2015-05-21T14:38:50 <Bosmon> In terms of the timing of the "initial model transaction" we do have some well-known issues with it: http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5519
2015-05-21T14:38:51 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay, for now i\'ll just make them update afterRender
2015-05-21T14:39:05 <Bosmon> Since it\'s hard to control exactly when it occurs relative, say, to the "onCreate" of a component versus its subcomponents
2015-05-21T14:39:49 <Bosmon> This was actually the exact issue I was just trying to clean up last night in my framework branch, but I think we\'ll still have to wait for the "async ginger" world after all
2015-05-21T14:40:54 <Justin_o> ah okay, that makes sense
2015-05-21T14:48:59 * gtirloni joined the channel
2015-05-21T15:09:59 <Justin_o> simonjb: the documentation about the repetition expander can be seen here http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/RendererComponentTreeExpanders.html
2015-05-21T15:21:01 <Bosmon> simonjb - to save time, it would be perfectly acceptable to construct the markup for this tool using a loop using fluid.stringTemplate and then string concatenation
2015-05-21T15:21:28 <Bosmon> The template would then be stored in the "markup" area of the component\'s options so it can be configured
2015-05-21T15:21:48 <Bosmon> Especially since we are doing no data binding, I think this would simplify things a fair amount and lessen the time you need to spend boggling over the Renderer documentation :)
2015-05-21T15:22:00 <Bosmon> I know that there are several people who may be reading this who may be horrified by my suggestion :)
2015-05-21T15:22:25 <simonjb> thanks Bosmon, I was just in the process of "boggling"
2015-05-21T15:24:26 <colinclark> STRING TEMPLATING IS THE NEW RENDERER
2015-05-21T15:24:36 <colinclark> I see smoke!
2015-05-21T15:24:40 <simonjb> Bosmon, the building of the markup would be done by hooking into an event (after the language list is available) and then setting the markup on the component?
2015-05-21T15:24:40 <Bosmon> THE NEW IS MERELY THE OLD THAT HAS BEEN THOROUGHLY FORGOTTEN : P
2015-05-21T15:24:46 <colinclark> :)
2015-05-21T15:24:48 <Bosmon> simonjb - that\'s right, yes
2015-05-21T15:25:24 <Bosmon> It will a pretty simpleminded approach that I think will be pretty quick to implement and pretty easy to read : P
2015-05-21T15:25:30 <colinclark> simonjb: I agree with Bosmon, if it helps any, that if the problem is clear enough, it\'s worth avoiding the Renderer
2015-05-21T15:25:41 <Bosmon> Except for very specialised cases, I think it is probably time for us to start getting used to the fact that we "don\'t have a Renderer"
2015-05-21T15:25:48 <colinclark> +1
2015-05-21T15:25:49 <simonjb> thanks both, that\'s the direction that I will take
2015-05-21T15:26:51 <Bosmon> And when in the fullness of time, we DO have a renderer, it will also have to accommodate the possibility that someone might choose to generate markup using fluid.stringTemplate, handlebars, or whatever
2015-05-21T15:26:58 <Bosmon> So this approach couldn\'t even be called "future-incompatible"

2015-05-21T18:10:54 <Bosmon> Hi there simonjb - in looking through the current implementation, it seems that what we seemed to determine during the conversation with cindyli wasn\'t correct, that it renders markup corresponding to all languages and uses CSS to scroll a range of 3 of them into view
2015-05-21T18:11:08 <Bosmon> It appears that the tool re-renders completely, even when there has just been paging
2015-05-21T18:11:42 <Bosmon> Are you planning to keep it that way in your reworking of the rendering, or do you have plans to make markup corresponding to the complete list of selections?
