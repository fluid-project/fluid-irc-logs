2015-04-28T18:51:52 <jhung> (note: the %3F replacing the ?)
2015-04-28T18:52:35 <jhung> The real solution will require doing some updating to the MediaWiki content which may take a little longer .

2015-04-28T18:59:37 <jessm> jhung: i think your quick fix is prolly the good one
2015-04-28T18:59:45 <jessm> it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t change urls
2015-04-28T19:00:31 <jhung> I\'ll still file a Jira for the issue though. But hopefully we\'ll dump MediaWiki before we need to fix it jessm. :)
2015-04-28T19:00:43 <jessm> sounds good

2015-04-28T19:11:27 <cindyli> danaayotte: if users come to the sticky key assessment panel, half way thru the assessment, for instance, they were detected needing help and "try it" button shows, but they click "back" to go to some other panels and make some adjustment, such as switching to another language or changing text size, when they come back to the sticky key assessment panel, what should they see? should the panel gets reset for users to start over, or it stays w

2015-04-28T19:24:07 <Bosmon> Hi there cindyli - my implementation of the localised resource fetcher is ready: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/596
2015-04-28T19:24:12 <Bosmon> Perhaps you would like to look it over :)
2015-04-28T19:24:28 <cindyli> sure, Bosmon
2015-04-28T19:25:14 <Bosmon> The test case should be pretty self-explanatory... and hopefully this will be pretty straightforward to integrate with the ResourceLoader for the prefs framework
2015-04-28T19:25:24 <Bosmon> All you need to do is supply the locale code within the resourceSpec entry
2015-04-28T19:25:58 <danaayotte> cindyli the sticky-key panel should not get reset - it should return to the same state as the user left it
2015-04-28T19:26:20 <cindyli> got it, danaayotte
2015-04-28T19:27:53 <cindyli> sounds good, Bosmon
2015-04-28T19:30:11 <cindyli> Bosmon: regarding ur first line comment in ur pull request - /** NOTE: All contents of this file are DEPRECATED\xe2\x80\xa6
2015-04-28T19:30:18 <cindyli> why are they deprecated?
2015-04-28T19:30:31 <Bosmon> cindyli - FluidRequests is junk from the previous decade :)
2015-04-28T19:30:37 <Bosmon> We certainly don\'t want anyone using it but us
2015-04-28T19:30:53 <Bosmon> Almost 100% of that file will disappear once we have the async ginger world
2015-04-28T19:31:03 <cindyli> ok, didn\'t know that
2015-04-28T19:31:14 <Bosmon> In fact the only bit that won\'t disappear might be the bit that I just wrote : P
2015-04-28T19:32:03 <Bosmon> 100% of FluidRequests can be replaced by the combination of async ginger world and the dataSource system
2015-04-28T19:33:54 <cindyli> ok, so do you wanna move the comment to where the deprecation starts. at least fluid.explodeLocalisedName() seems able to survive
2015-04-28T19:34:01 <cindyli> Bosmon: ^
2015-04-28T19:34:15 <Bosmon> cindyli - that isn\'t an API in any case
2015-04-28T19:34:23 <cindyli> that\'s true
2015-04-28T19:34:30 <Bosmon> I think we want to announce that every function there is not an API function
2015-04-28T19:34:55 <cindyli> that makes sense. but we don\'t mark all those deprecated
2015-04-28T19:36:16 <Bosmon> cindyli - well, there are no API functions in the file that are not deprecated :)
2015-04-28T19:36:47 <cindyli> ok
2015-04-28T19:39:29 <cindyli> Bosmon: in terms of my pull request for FLOE-281, will you test and merge or you prefer someone else to do it?
2015-04-28T19:40:36 <Bosmon> cindyli - I\'m not too sure of what the expected application function is
2015-04-28T19:40:45 <Bosmon> I\'d prefer that someone more familiar with the spec would test it
2015-04-28T19:41:14 <Bosmon> As far as I\'m concerned, the code is ok and the test cases pass
2015-04-28T19:41:23 <cindyli> cool. Bosmon, i will bug justin when he comes back tomorrow. ;)
2015-04-28T19:42:38 <Bosmon> cindyli - cool
2015-04-28T19:53:43 <Bosmon> cindyli - could you add a reference to http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5659 in your relay rules in the FLOE-281 branch? Thanks

2015-04-28T15:13:38 <cindyli> Bosmon: i\'m making use of the indexOf transform in the pull request for the language panel and having an interesting issue
2015-04-28T15:14:32 <Bosmon> "I see" : P
2015-04-28T15:14:33 <cindyli> this test fails: https://github.com/cindyli/first-discovery/blob/FLOE-281/tests/js/panelsTests.js#L132-L135
2015-04-28T15:14:39 <cindyli> haha
2015-04-28T15:15:03 <cindyli> well, it fails because the firstLangSelected is not updated at this point
2015-04-28T15:15:17 <cindyli> the tests before it work completely fine
2015-04-28T15:15:45 <cindyli> one sec, digging out the transform
2015-04-28T15:16:11 <cindyli> the transform for firstLangSelected - https://github.com/cindyli/first-discovery/blob/FLOE-281/src/js/panels.js#L258-L263
2015-04-28T15:16:37 <cindyli> it uses "indexOf" and "binaryOp", i traced into both those transforms in infusion
2015-04-28T15:16:56 <cindyli> "indexOf" gets executed, but it didn\'t hit "binaryOp"
2015-04-28T15:17:14 <cindyli> isn\'t it interesting, Bosmon?
2015-04-28T15:17:28 <Bosmon> I was hoping that this would not be "interesting" in quite that way
2015-04-28T15:17:43 <cindyli> lol, totally agree
2015-04-28T15:18:37 * jhung joined the channel
2015-04-28T15:18:42 <cindyli> let me add a source for firstLangSelected transform
2015-04-28T15:18:58 <Bosmon> It\'s not necessary
2015-04-28T15:19:02 <Bosmon> What would the source be, anyway
2015-04-28T15:19:48 <cindyli> "langIndex", it didn\'t help
2015-04-28T15:19:49 <Bosmon> Ok
2015-04-28T15:19:53 <Bosmon> Is it all checked in so I can test?

2015-04-28T15:53:26 <jhung> anastasiac: in the TOC pull request, I changed it so the first child of a section does not have a line at the top. Putting a line on the bottom of the last item looked a bit odd since it seemed unnecessary with the bold header text of the next section.

2015-04-28T16:48:54 <anastasiac> jhung, the site hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s anything to merge, but feel free to double-check
2015-04-28T16:49:01 <anastasiac> dana\xe2\x80\x99s branch isn\xe2\x80\x99t in yet

2015-04-28T17:13:53 <Bosmon> Hi cindyli - i\'ve made a "placeholder JIRA" at http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5659 and I\'ve already forked a copy of the current state of your FLOE-281 branch to my repo, so you can feel free to trash its state right away
2015-04-28T17:14:23 <cindyli> that\'s neat. thanks, Bosmon
2015-04-28T17:27:32 * kasparnet has quit
2015-04-28T17:29:45 <cindyli> Bosmon: the pull request for the language panel, FLOE-281, is ready for another review.
2015-04-28T17:42:05 <Bosmon> cindyli - good grief... you\'re finished already :)
2015-04-28T17:42:44 <cindyli> don\'t be jealous, yours are coming along too ;)
2015-04-28T17:45:42 <Bosmon> That\'s a remarkably harmless change, cindyli
2015-04-28T17:45:51 <Bosmon> Surprising that it\'s enough to make it work
2015-04-28T17:45:55 <cindyli> nice
2015-04-28T17:46:00 <Bosmon> But then, I guess the bug is a very peculiar one
2015-04-28T17:46:39 <cindyli> i wonder if it\'s something in "indexOf" since that was the first layer
2015-04-28T17:46:46 <Bosmon> Well
2015-04-28T17:46:52 <Bosmon> There\'s clearly no problem with the actual transforms
2015-04-28T17:47:02 <cindyli> ok
2015-04-28T17:47:19 <Bosmon> But I will finish localised resources first before turning back to debugging
2015-04-28T17:47:33 <cindyli> certainly
2015-04-28T17:47:33 <Bosmon> Your pull request looks great to me, cindyli - but I wonder if someone else needs to review it before it gets merged?
2015-04-28T17:48:04 <cindyli> Bosmon: i think your review should be good enough.
2015-04-28T17:49:45 <Bosmon> cindyli - what will you work on now?
2015-04-28T17:50:17 <cindyli> justin\'s FLOE-299, the sticky key assessment panel, Bosmon
2015-04-28T17:50:29 <Bosmon> cindyli - cool

2015-04-28T17:54:47 <anastasiac> cindyli, I\xe2\x80\x99ve issued a pull request against your FLOE-299 branch, for the extra sticky keys instructions
2015-04-28T17:54:59 <cindyli> thanks, anastasiac, will merge that in

2015-04-28T18:16:08 <anastasiac> thanks, jhung
2015-04-28T18:17:17 <jhung> There\'s an annoying 1px line along the top of the site. It\'s related to the prefspanel, but I can\'t figure out where it\'s coming from. Low priority I guess.
2015-04-28T18:17:50 <anastasiac> low priority, I agree, jhung
2015-04-28T18:18:28 <jhung> btw thanks for merging those infusion-docs pull reqs anastasiac.
2015-04-28T18:18:36 <anastasiac> jhung, the About, Partners and Contacts links along the top are annoyingly close to the top; in high contrast, it looks actively bad. Any chance you could play with that?
2015-04-28T18:18:50 <jhung> anastasiac:  sure
2015-04-28T18:24:33 <jhung> anastasiac: updated.

2015-04-28T18:34:06 <jessm> ok
2015-04-28T18:34:07 <jessm> cool
2015-04-28T18:35:09 <jhung> as for EPUB, the demo is working. There is a bug with iBooks where keyboard focus is not appearing. I sent PhET a path for a fix, but it hasn\'t made it into the demo yet.

2015-04-28T18:35:24 <jessm> ah, great jhung \xe2\x80\x94 thanks
2015-04-28T18:35:36 <jessm> jhung: also, while we\xe2\x80\x99re at it and we should always have 3 things :)
2015-04-28T18:35:37 <jessm> ...
2015-04-28T18:36:19 <jessm> jhung: our PhET work isn\xe2\x80\x99t well represented in the wiki \xe2\x80\x94 in other words there isn\xe2\x80\x99t a place to go and see it \xe2\x80\x94 do you have thoughts or ideas about how to change that and make it more visible?
2015-04-28T18:38:10 <jhung> Yes. Good point jessm. This would go nicely with the upcoming PhET related work michelled and I were talking about yesterday. We were talking about doing a new a11y pass on a different sim. It would make sense to have better documentation as we work through it.
2015-04-28T18:39:07 <jhung> The ILDH and PHeT are my next to-dos.
2015-04-28T18:40:06 <jessm> jhung: i endorse this statement :)
2015-04-28T18:40:56 <jhung> excellent. I\'ll take a look at that ILDH url issue and get back to you.
2015-04-28T18:41:06 <jessm> jhung: thanks muchly
