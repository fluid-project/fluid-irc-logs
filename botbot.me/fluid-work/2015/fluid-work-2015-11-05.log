b'2015-11-05T18:57:26 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I think building dev versions of things that are not in master was one of our prime use cases
2015-11-05T18:57:31 <Bosmon> I actually did it once already : P
2015-11-05T18:57:35 <Bosmon> I don\'t think anyone noticed : P
2015-11-05T18:57:39 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i don\'t think so :)
2015-11-05T18:57:57 <Justin_o> Bosmon:  here\'s the error i\'m getting now anyways, in case you have an idea of what\'s wrong

2015-11-05T18:59:15 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, it will be an infusion mismatch problem
2015-11-05T18:59:23 <Bosmon> I guess if you have something like that you may as well move up to trunk
2015-11-05T18:59:32 <Bosmon> Since it will just take too long to sort out otherwise
2015-11-05T18:59:37 <Bosmon> I know I can support you from trunk : P

2015-11-05T19:00:03 <Bosmon> I don\'t think the SVN terminology is ever going to die in my mind
2015-11-05T19:00:17 <Justin_o> Bosmon: oh okay, is there a newer revision to work off of, or should i just use the git endpoint?
2015-11-05T19:01:01 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I have:         "infusion": "git://github.com/amb26/infusion.git#539c8dc6bdd2170944c0a4c58da52dd37fb098c0",

2015-11-05T19:01:05 <Justin_o> ah thanks

2015-11-05T19:01:36 <Bosmon> And I actually have..... SOME..... passing tests : P

2015-11-05T18:14:08 <anastasiac> will do, jhung
2015-11-05T18:14:13 <jhung> thanks!
2015-11-05T18:28:07 <anastasiac> jhung: were there any earlier pull requests for the ildh repo?
2015-11-05T18:29:01 <jhung> no anastasiac - there\'s just 1 currently
2015-11-05T18:29:29 <jhung> darn it anastasiac missing a file.

2015-11-05T18:30:54 <jhung> anastasiac: updated the pull
2015-11-05T18:31:03 <anastasiac> yep
2015-11-05T18:31:19 <anastasiac> well, I got to test the 404 page :-)
2015-11-05T18:31:30 <jhung> :)
2015-11-05T18:36:33 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i\'m having an issue with the datasource
2015-11-05T18:36:57 <Justin_o> i\'m providing a termMap but it is just replacing the value of the term into the url instead of getting the value from the directModel
2015-11-05T18:37:18 <Justin_o> Bosmon: this is my datasource
2015-11-05T18:37:25 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, it has reverted to that behaviour
2015-11-05T18:37:26 <Justin_o> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/ZGn1qNo0/
2015-11-05T18:37:28 * gtirloni_ joined the channel
2015-11-05T18:37:29 <Bosmon> Hopefully I fixed the docs to match
2015-11-05T18:37:47 <Justin_o> Bosmon: this is my set request
2015-11-05T18:37:51 <Bosmon> Justin_o - you now need to write "view": "%ontology"
2015-11-05T18:37:54 <Justin_o> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/or4XTX3k/
2015-11-05T18:37:57 <Bosmon> To request interpolation from the directmodel
2015-11-05T18:38:04 <Justin_o> oh
2015-11-05T18:38:22 <Bosmon> This was actually the historical behaviour, I thought it would be simpler without it but I found I had to revert to it in the end
2015-11-05T18:38:25 <Justin_o> that\'s somewhat unexpected
2015-11-05T18:38:54 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I had thought so, which is why I got rid of it : P
2015-11-05T18:39:08 <Justin_o> Bosmon: so the docs are
2015-11-05T18:39:11 <Justin_o> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/rNWwsMqo/
2015-11-05T18:39:27 <Justin_o> so that\'s incorrect, and it was switched back to use %pathName
2015-11-05T18:41:00 <Bosmon> Justin_o - thanks for picking that up, I\'ll fix the docs in a commit shortly
2015-11-05T18:41:09 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks
2015-11-05T18:41:20 <Bosmon> The example itself is correct at least : P
2015-11-05T18:41:21 <Bosmon> https://github.com/amb26/kettle/blob/KETTLE-32/examples/simpleDataSource/simpleDataSource.js#L24
2015-11-05T18:41:31 <Justin_o> Bosmon: :)
2015-11-05T18:41:47 <jhung> anastasiac: thanks for looking over the site. I\'m going to run the link check on it.
2015-11-05T18:41:48 <Justin_o> i\'ve changed my config, and it is definitely working too
2015-11-05T18:42:01 <jhung> hopefully that will catch what you
2015-11-05T18:42:04 <Bosmon> So yes, in the end I found that there can be good reasons for wanting to interpolate static material into URLs
2015-11-05T18:42:10 <jhung> \'re finding while saving you time anastasiac. :)
2015-11-05T18:42:13 <Bosmon> For example, port numbers or some other piece of configuration-derived material
2015-11-05T18:42:13 <anastasiac> ok, jhung, I\xe2\x80\x99ll stop checking all the links :-)
2015-11-05T18:42:22 <Justin_o> Bosmon: sure, that makes sense
2015-11-05T18:42:31 <Bosmon> The reason for it has weakened now that I have factored off kettle.dataSource.file into its own grade
2015-11-05T18:42:43 <Bosmon> Since it is much more common to interpolate static material into file paths - such as module roots, etc.
2015-11-05T18:43:11 <colinclark> Hey Justin_o, is there any documentation for your low-level text to speech component?
2015-11-05T18:43:23 <colinclark> I need a component that will let me read text
2015-11-05T18:43:32 <colinclark> and ideally will fire an event when it\'s done
2015-11-05T18:43:41 * slim__ joined the channel
2015-11-05T18:43:51 <Justin_o> colinclark: hmm.. can\'t remember if there are docs, i\'ll take a look, but it should do all those things you want
2015-11-05T18:43:59 <colinclark> cool
2015-11-05T18:44:03 <colinclark> I can live with no docs
2015-11-05T18:44:07 <colinclark> but if you have any, that\'s nice too

2015-11-05T18:45:52 <Justin_o> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/o7J1flay/
2015-11-05T18:46:15 <Justin_o> Bosmon: should the response be a JSON object or stringified version of one
2015-11-05T18:46:30 <Bosmon> Justin_o - if you are working with latest trunk, you should note that I renamed the "setResponseNamespaces" option in response to your feedback
2015-11-05T18:46:34 <Bosmon> This one IS reflected in the docs : P
2015-11-05T18:46:41 <Bosmon> It is now "setResponseTransforms"
2015-11-05T18:46:58 <Justin_o> Bosmon: ah okay i\'ll destroy my vm and try that
2015-11-05T18:46:58 <Bosmon> Hopefully this is a little more intelligible, but if it isn\'t, I\'m open to suggestions :)
2015-11-05T18:47:35 <Bosmon> Justin_o - with the [] filtering, the response will just be as it came from the server
2015-11-05T18:47:39 <Bosmon> As a giant string
2015-11-05T18:47:50 <Bosmon> If it is JSON you will need to parse it yourself
2015-11-05T18:48:09 <Justin_o> Bosmon: ah okay, so i can\'t force it to be automatically parsed as JSON?
2015-11-05T18:48:14 <Justin_o> that\'s fine, just want to confirm
2015-11-05T18:48:38 <colinclark> alanharnum: http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/TextToSpeechAPI.html
2015-11-05T18:48:43 <Bosmon> Justin_o - no, I think it would be too bizarre to put in infrastructure to explicitly deal with services which accept payloads in one format and return results in another : P
2015-11-05T18:48:49 <Bosmon> Although I guess this sums up what "Web 1.0" was
2015-11-05T18:49:14 <Justin_o> Bosmon: by the way, "setResponseTransforms" seems like a better name
2015-11-05T18:49:18 <Bosmon> Justin_o - cheers
2015-11-05T18:49:31 <Bosmon> When I first named it I was expecting it to be extremely rarely used...
2015-11-05T18:50:08 <Bosmon> But the-t-in-rtf and I will be working over the next few months to think about how we can scale the DataSource system to deal with more ambitious tasks
2015-11-05T18:50:09 <Justin_o> mine could be a special case
2015-11-05T18:50:16 <Bosmon> Justin_o - it\'s probably not all that special
2015-11-05T18:50:25 <Bosmon> It\'s just that, historically, DataSource has been incredibly primitive
2015-11-05T18:50:43 <anastasiac> jhung: maybe we could sit down and look at the keyboard interactions with the \xe2\x80\x9cskip to\xe2\x80\x9d links. I know they\xe2\x80\x99ve been discussed, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t recall the conclusions, so I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure if they\xe2\x80\x99re behaving the way we concluded
2015-11-05T18:50:55 <Bosmon> However, with a lot of GPII work now on the table I\'ve had to spend the time to bring it up to a bit more decency
2015-11-05T18:51:20 <Bosmon> ADTKINS has now already complained that it isn\'t adequate for his CouchDB work, which is perfectly clear
2015-11-05T18:51:40 <Bosmon> But I imagine this will involve a lot more thinking about how to deal with "asymmetrical" resources perhaps of the kind you already have here
2015-11-05T18:51:52 <Bosmon> That is, resources where the "read" operation doesn\'t look much like the "write" on
2015-11-05T18:51:53 <Bosmon> one
2015-11-05T18:52:35 <Bosmon> Although philosophically I think such resources are smelly
2015-11-05T18:54:43 <Justin_o> Bosmon: a bit of diversion, did anything else change in your branch? I recreated my VM but am now getting an error from kettle starting the node app
2015-11-05T18:55:13 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, unfortunately I had to bind to my own branch of infusion since I have a couple of pulls waiting for colinclark
2015-11-05T18:55:25 <Justin_o> Bosmon: ah :(
2015-11-05T18:55:30 <Bosmon> I guess I could roll a dev release now to make things a bit easier
2015-11-05T18:56:02 <Justin_o> Bosmon: would it solve the infusion issue in mine?
2015-11-05T18:56:04 <Bosmon> Sadly I spent all of yesterday making very big changes to the grade closure algorithm
2015-11-05T18:56:08 <Justin_o> because i\'m binding to a dev version of infusion
2015-11-05T18:56:13 <Justin_o> or did you mean a dev version of infusion
2015-11-05T18:56:22 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I meant a dev version of infusion
2015-11-05T18:56:58 <Bosmon> Justin_o - you could just stay with the version you have
2015-11-05T18:57:05 <Bosmon> Given I think we resolved your issue
2015-11-05T18:57:06 <Justin_o> Bosmon: hmm.. i guess i could just bind to the version of infusion you are using for kettle, i don\'t know what it would mean to build dev versions for things that aren\'t in master

2015-11-05T04:09:02 <colinclark> Bosmon: Unfortunately it looks like the new test for FluidError fail in IE
2015-11-05T04:09:22 <colinclark> due to the absence of the "stack" property on the error
2015-11-05T04:10:43 <Bosmon> colinclark - !!!!
2015-11-05T04:10:55 <colinclark> I typed this here before I knew you were going to bed
2015-11-05T04:10:59 <colinclark> otherwise I would have refrained :)
2015-11-05T04:11:08 <Bosmon> No errors on IE have stacks, or what.............
2015-11-05T04:11:52 <Bosmon> https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh699850(v=vs.94).aspx
2015-11-05T04:11:58 <Bosmon> It does look like the property basically exists
2015-11-05T04:12:38 <Bosmon> "The stack property is set to undefined when the error is constructed, and gets the trace information when the error is raised."
2015-11-05T04:12:50 <colinclark> yes
2015-11-05T04:13:36 <Bosmon> This is unlike the behaviour on all the other platforms
2015-11-05T04:13:41 <Bosmon> Where the stack is filled in on construction
2015-11-05T04:13:53 <Bosmon> But you\'d think that throwing the error would be enough to count as "raising" it
2015-11-05T04:14:02 <Bosmon> But presumably it thinks it can\'t find it, in the resulting hierarchy
2015-11-05T04:14:09 <colinclark> What else could count as raising it, other than throwing it?
2015-11-05T04:14:45 <colinclark> This test doesn\'t actually throw the error
2015-11-05T04:14:54 <Bosmon> ah
2015-11-05T04:14:58 <Bosmon> Interesting
2015-11-05T04:15:04 <colinclark> Let\'s have a look at that
2015-11-05T04:15:05 <Bosmon> Perhaps it can be fixed simply then
2015-11-05T04:15:19 <colinclark> I\'ll just throw it and catch it
2015-11-05T04:17:31 <colinclark> Bizarrely that doesn\'t even seem to be good enoughj
2015-11-05T04:18:00 <Bosmon> We\'ll probably just have to do a bloody browser detect
2015-11-05T04:18:01 <Bosmon> https://github.com/stacktracejs/stacktrace.js/blob/master/stacktrace.js#L60
2015-11-05T04:18:17 <Bosmon> I\'m sure if we simply throw a plain "Error" we\'ll get a stack
2015-11-05T04:18:33 <Bosmon> So we\'ll just have to throw one, catch it, and then stick the stack in
2015-11-05T04:18:42 <colinclark> That sounds vaguely familiar, yes
2015-11-05T04:18:52 <Bosmon> Well, it\'s what we used to do :)
2015-11-05T04:18:57 <Bosmon> Until we found it wasn\'t supported on node 4
2015-11-05T04:18:58 <colinclark> aha
2015-11-05T04:19:34 <Bosmon> Hmm ... well, actually we didn\'t, I guess
2015-11-05T04:19:46 <Bosmon> We just had a rather more cack-handed way than this one of inheriting from Error
2015-11-05T04:20:13 <Bosmon> Which version of IE are you testing with?
2015-11-05T04:22:44 <colinclark> IE11
2015-11-05T04:22:46 <colinclark> Edge is fine
2015-11-05T04:23:03 <colinclark> IE11 in Windows 10
2015-11-05T04:23:16 <Bosmon> ok
2015-11-05T04:23:20 <Bosmon> I\'ll take a look tomorrow
2015-11-05T04:23:22 <colinclark> yep
2015-11-05T04:23:33 <colinclark> have a really good sleep
2015-11-05T04:23:44 <Bosmon> Cheers :)

2015-11-05T12:28:19 <jhernandez> Bosmon: bonjour
2015-11-05T12:28:49 <jhernandez> I\'ve started adding some tests for our deviceReporter\'s get function
2015-11-05T12:29:42 <jhernandez> so far, I\'ve started with the static one
2015-11-05T12:30:06 <jhernandez> (https://github.com/javihernandez/universal/commit/fbdc8eef8adbd4f7624d31cc6faec7ce07fc20c0)
2015-11-05T12:30:18 <jhernandez> next is the live one
2015-11-05T12:30:30 <jhernandez> but I\'m not sure how to face it
2015-11-05T12:32:50 <jhernandez> I mean, we need to mock the live deviceReporter again, and I was wondering whether I can make use of the deviceReporter mocking support we already have in our integration testing framework
2015-11-05T12:43:31 <the-t-in-rtf> What commit of Kettle uses the new name for the jqUnit dependency?  @Bosmon
2015-11-05T12:43:53 <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. "node-jqunit"
2015-11-05T12:47:07 <the-t-in-rtf> Can I use Kettle-32?  https://github.com/amb26/kettle/tree/KETTLE-32

2015-11-05T12:54:19 * alanharnum has quit
2015-11-05T12:56:46 <the-t-in-rtf> It doesn\'t seem like it, I get really odd errors.  Anyway, is there a companion version of Kettle that works post name change?

2015-11-05T12:59:28 * slim_ joined the channel
2015-11-05T12:59:32 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - you should try to work with my current branch - although there are a few changes, it is stable
2015-11-05T12:59:39 <Bosmon> What kind of "really odd" errors do you get?
2015-11-05T13:00:10 <the-t-in-rtf> http://pastie.org/10531829
2015-11-05T13:00:20 <the-t-in-rtf> I\'m not even using data sources in that package yet.
2015-11-05T13:00:55 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - you have a mismatched version of Infusion
2015-11-05T13:00:59 <Bosmon> You\'ll need to upgrade that too
2015-11-05T13:01:22 <the-t-in-rtf> OK, which is your "current" branch?
2015-11-05T13:01:24 <the-t-in-rtf> Kettle-32?
2015-11-05T13:01:33 <the-t-in-rtf> I was just looking at what had been updated recently.
2015-11-05T13:01:34 <Bosmon> yes
2015-11-05T13:01:36 <Bosmon> That one
2015-11-05T13:01:43 <Bosmon> And copy the Infusion reference from its package.json
2015-11-05T13:01:47 <Bosmon> I just fixed it up last night
2015-11-05T13:03:02 <the-t-in-rtf> Can I safely use the node-jqunit version as well?
2015-11-05T13:03:10 <the-t-in-rtf> or do I need a particular commit for that as well?
2015-11-05T13:03:18 <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. "node-jqunit":          "~1.1.3",
2015-11-05T13:03:20 <Bosmon> Yes, node-jqunit is stable enough
2015-11-05T13:03:22 <Bosmon> Yes, the one in npm
2015-11-05T13:03:56 <the-t-in-rtf> Thanks, refreshing my dependencies now.
2015-11-05T13:04:29 <Bosmon> Sorry for this phase of "ZIGGING" but every time I try to get gpii universal working again I then discover something has fallen apart in one of the lower layers
2015-11-05T13:04:54 <Bosmon> This time I finally decided to refactor dataSource into kettle.dataSource.URL and kettle.dataSource.file, which is the way it should have been since the beginning
2015-11-05T13:05:11 <Bosmon> But this then shook loose problems in Infusion dealing with multidimensional grade hierarchies....
2015-11-05T13:05:40 <Bosmon> kettle.dataSource.CouchDB has now become a mere mixin grade, which then has to apply to both those two dataSource variant as well as the writable/non-writable varieties
2015-11-05T13:05:48 <Bosmon> Which creates a nice little "cube" of 8 classes.....
2015-11-05T13:07:04 <the-t-in-rtf> No worries, we are back to the test errors that are firmly my fault.
2015-11-05T13:07:17 <Bosmon> awesome
2015-11-05T13:07:37 <the-t-in-rtf> I only started upgrading because somehow my copy of fluid.fail wasn\'t throwing instances of fluid.FluidError.
2015-11-05T13:08:05 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, it works in the version you sent and in older versions.
2015-11-05T13:08:20 <the-t-in-rtf> I think I just wandered into no man\'s land with mismatching updates to jqUnit, kettle, and infusion.
2015-11-05T13:09:07 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - that will have been this issue: https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5807
2015-11-05T13:09:19 <the-t-in-rtf> Yes, I read that earlier.
2015-11-05T13:09:30 <Bosmon> It seems that node 4 treats Error objects in some perversely different way
2015-11-05T13:10:05 <Bosmon> It now turns out that IE11 treats them in yet another perversely different way

2015-11-05T14:57:28 <Bosmon> ok colinclark - my FLUID-5807 branch is fixed up to work on IE11
2015-11-05T14:57:48 <Bosmon> It looks like you don\'t get a stack trace whatever you do on IE9
2015-11-05T14:57:51 <Bosmon> IE10 I haven\'t tested
2015-11-05T15:04:32 <colinclark> Good thing we only support IE11
2015-11-05T15:04:34 <colinclark> thanks, Bosmon

2015-11-05T15:14:21 <anastasiac> feel free to suggest a better name
2015-11-05T15:14:29 <anastasiac> I did re-classify the jiras I found so far
2015-11-05T15:14:32 <anastasiac> but I may have missed some
2015-11-05T15:14:44 <jhung> ok. If I come across any I\'ll love them over.
