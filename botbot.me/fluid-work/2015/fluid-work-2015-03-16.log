2015-03-16T12:49:56 <jessm> good morning gtirloni
2015-03-16T12:50:12 <jessm> apropos of nothing in particular, here\xe2\x80\x99s a JIRA you might want to keep a watch on: https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-5574
2015-03-16T12:50:23 * anastasiac joined the channel
2015-03-16T12:50:46 <jessm> not a lot happening there, but lately a few things that hopefully suggest they\xe2\x80\x99re working on it
2015-03-16T12:53:29 <gtirloni> gm jessm
2015-03-16T12:53:48 <gtirloni> thanks, i\'ve subscribed to receive updates for that issue
2015-03-16T12:54:11 <gtirloni> (and voted)
2015-03-16T12:54:15 <jessm> gtirloni: cool. i think there\xe2\x80\x99s another related one, but i don\xe2\x80\x99t have the url closeby
2015-03-16T12:55:07 <Justin_o> Bosmon: I was looking at http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5597 which is about passing down a panel\'s own message bundle to it, instead of merging them all together at the top. We had talked about this before ( see comment on the jira for a link to the channel log ). The strategy we decided was to create a new subcomponent for the message resolver
2015-03-16T12:55:07 <Justin_o> in each panel, and to pass this along to the renderer options for the renderer to use, instead of making its own. This was going okay, till i came to the composite panel. In a composite panel the rendering information is hoisted up from the sub panels to the parent panel, which handles all the rendering. How should I deal with the message bundles in this
2015-03-16T12:55:07 <Justin_o> case?
2015-03-16T12:56:34 <gtirloni> jessm: there is one for Confluence too: https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-14249
2015-03-16T12:56:50 <jessm> gtirloni: yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s it!
2015-03-16T12:59:02 <jessm> gtirloni: i didn\xe2\x80\x99t know you could vote! now i have\xe2\x80\xa6

2015-03-16T13:18:25 <Bosmon> Justin_o - it appears that there\'s already so much tree-aware reprocessing logic in the compositePanel that it won\'t hurt to add some more
2015-03-16T13:18:50 <Bosmon> I suggest that as part of the "rebaseTree" logic you also perform the fetching of the messages from the appropriate bundle, and just insert them literally into the tree
2015-03-16T13:19:49 <Bosmon> And so pass the relevant child messageBundle along to this function, alongside the subtree and model etc.
2015-03-16T13:20:44 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay, i was wondering if that would be the way to handle it.. it will probably get a bit complicated when handling the msgLookup syntax and the templating but it should be doable at least.
2015-03-16T13:20:56 <Justin_o> Bosmon: what does your last comment mean
2015-03-16T13:21:02 * anvk joined the channel
2015-03-16T13:21:23 <Justin_o> the subpanel won\'t create it\'s own resolver? or the function will be passed the resolver from the sub panel?
2015-03-16T13:21:24 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I was just talking about the arguments to the rebaseTree function
2015-03-16T13:22:08 <Bosmon> The individual panel\'s component will be passed its own message bundle as you mentioned earlier
2015-03-16T13:22:20 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay, thanks

2015-03-16T13:26:41 <simonjb> hi Bosmon, would you have some time today to discuss the SelectionTree?
2015-03-16T13:27:51 <Bosmon> simonjb - sure - I just added a small review comment just now - I think it\'s looking good
2015-03-16T13:29:57 <simonjb> Bosmon: just read your comment and yes, I can definitely make that change
2015-03-16T13:30:09 <simonjb> Bosmon: but otherwise, you think it looking ok?
2015-03-16T13:30:33 <Bosmon> I think so, yes
2015-03-16T13:30:46 <Bosmon> I could talk a bit now, if it\'s a good time
2015-03-16T13:31:01 <simonjb> sure, call me on skype?

2015-03-16T15:30:49 <Justin_o> Bosmon: for FLUID-5600 http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5600 we want to be able to pass in gradeNames to prefsEditor loader to replace the prefsEditorType option that i has to be passed in at runtime now. Should the option the auxiliary schema be called gradeNames or loaderGrades, or something else?
2015-03-16T15:31:30 <Justin_o> the auxiliarySchema is sometimes packaged up into a grade, so not sure if having an option called gradeNames would be dangerous
