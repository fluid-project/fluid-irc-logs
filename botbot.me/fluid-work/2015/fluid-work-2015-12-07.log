2015-12-07T17:39:30 <Justin_o> Bosmon: I have some kettle config questions for you, if you have a moment
2015-12-07T17:39:37 <Bosmon> Hi Justin_o
2015-12-07T17:39:55 <Justin_o> Bosmon: so i\'m looking at https://github.com/amb26/kettle/tree/KETTLE-32#starting-a-kettle-config-from-the-command-line
2015-12-07T17:41:22 <Justin_o> Bosmon: so i\'m wondering what the best practice is here... should i put more than one config in the same config file? should my configs have the same name across config files?
2015-12-07T17:42:51 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I can\'t interpret that question, since a config simply "is" something in a config file : P
2015-12-07T17:43:04 <Bosmon> And the name of the config file is meant to be the name of the config
2015-12-07T17:43:12 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i guess i\'m wondering why you have to specify the file and the name
2015-12-07T17:43:21 <Bosmon> Justin_o - you specify the directory and the name
2015-12-07T17:43:24 <Bosmon> Not the file and the name
2015-12-07T17:44:35 <Justin_o> oh
2015-12-07T17:44:41 <Justin_o> and the name is the file name?
2015-12-07T17:44:52 <Justin_o> or it will look in all the configs for that name
2015-12-07T17:44:59 <Bosmon> The name is the file name
2015-12-07T17:45:08 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay, thanks

2015-12-07T18:30:34 <clown> jhernandez, quick question:  where are we installing \'nan\'?  In the linux project?  or somewhere more global?

2015-12-07T18:40:49 <clown> jhernandez:  forging ahead, putting it in the "node_modules" sub-folder of "linux".

2015-12-07T18:47:06 <jhernandez> clown: I was about pushing a commit with the initial port of gsettings addon to nan
2015-12-07T18:48:00 <jhernandez> and yeah, nan should be part of our platform specific implementation

2015-12-07T18:50:00 <clown> jhernandez:  (1) re:  your pushing a commit for nan:  cool!  (2) I\'m beginning to make the changes for packagekit (aka learning the nan-way).
2015-12-07T18:56:14 <jhernandez> clown: here you have this for your inspiration https://github.com/javihernandez/linux/commit/3e8d6451196c091d6dac558525377393183af448
2015-12-07T18:56:17 <jhernandez> ;)
2015-12-07T18:57:55 <jhernandez> also I finished the port of alsa and dealing with xrandr\'s one right now
2015-12-07T18:59:01 <clown> jhenandez, thanks.
2015-12-07T18:59:28 <jhernandez> you can use my GPII-1526 to start working on the packageKit one
2015-12-07T19:00:26 <jhernandez> then we can submit all together to Antranig\'s GPII-1318
