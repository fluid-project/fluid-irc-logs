2015-08-13T10:58:09 <Bosmon> It is like an avalanche these days : P
2015-08-13T10:58:39 <jhernandez> hahaha
2015-08-13T10:58:40 <jhernandez> why?!

2015-08-13T10:59:08 <jhernandez> it\'s me, just trying to do what I think my work is
2015-08-13T10:59:29 <Bosmon> Yes
2015-08-13T10:59:30 <jhernandez> I\'m really sorry for that
2015-08-13T10:59:36 <jhernandez> :P
2015-08-13T10:59:36 <Bosmon> Suddenly everyone seems to be doing that at the same time :)
2015-08-13T10:59:52 <jhernandez> hahaha
2015-08-13T11:02:45 <Bosmon> jhernandez
2015-08-13T11:02:51 <Bosmon> CAN I HELP YOU WITH SOMETHING!
2015-08-13T11:02:58 <jhernandez> no no
2015-08-13T11:04:03 <jhernandez> just commented/worked a bit on the xbacklight thing and I thought you deserved a "ANTWARNING" as a show of my love to you :P
2015-08-13T11:05:06 <jhernandez> rest of the day I\'ll be working on creating the new pull request for the SST integration thing we talked yesterday
2015-08-13T11:06:48 <jhernandez> and that\'s all, this afternoon I\'m starting my jazz manouche classes
2015-08-13T11:07:09 <jhernandez> so I won\'t bother you a lot more :P
2015-08-13T11:07:18 <jhernandez> Bosmon: :)
2015-08-13T11:27:22 <Bosmon> ANTWWARNNING!
2015-08-13T11:27:50 <Bosmon> jhernandez - thanks for all your good work on the XBAKLIT stuff

2015-08-13T12:45:09 <Justin_o> Bosmon: After today I won\'t be back at work till Aug 24. I\'m wondering if you could have another look at https://github.com/fluid-project/chartAuthoring/pull/3#discussion_r36206082
2015-08-13T12:45:21 <Justin_o> that way we could hopefully get it in before i left

2015-08-13T13:43:17 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks so much, i\'ll take a look at those shortly.
2015-08-13T13:45:24 <Bosmon> colinclark - the-t-in-rtf discovered an annoying issue with our new "postinstall" strategy: https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-1259

2015-08-13T14:06:43 <colinclark> Justin_o, Bosmon: Will one of you have time to look at my very minor pull requests for the 1.9.x branch? I know you\'re both super swamped with reviews and last-minute tasks
2015-08-13T14:07:25 <Justin_o> colinclark:  might have some time later today if Bosmon doesn\'t
2015-08-13T14:07:55 * avtar has left the channel
2015-08-13T14:08:20 <colinclark> I\'m thinking it would be great to publish npm packages of both versions of Infusion quite soon
2015-08-13T14:08:45 <colinclark> given how widely tested the code in master is, it would be good to cut our beta1 release now before too much new code flows in
2015-08-13T14:09:18 <colinclark> do you guys see any reason why we shouldn\'t just immediately cut 2.0.0-beta1 and publish it on npm?
2015-08-13T14:10:10 <colinclark> "immediately" being "when colinclark gets a chance to do it" since you guys are busy
2015-08-13T14:15:50 * murilocrivellari joined the channel
2015-08-13T14:17:49 <Justin_o> colinclark: i can\'t think of anything.. the only thing is if we want to call this one alpha1 or something, but i\'m fine with what you and Bosmon think is the appropriate name.
2015-08-13T14:18:18 <colinclark> I don\'t really mind, to be honest
2015-08-13T14:18:21 <Bosmon> colinclark - I think it would be good to fill out the ReleaseNotes.md file before we do that
2015-08-13T14:18:30 <colinclark> alpha, beta, I don\'t really mind
2015-08-13T14:18:38 <Bosmon> Let\'s just go with the decision we already made several times, Justin_o :)
2015-08-13T14:18:52 <Bosmon> These naming discussions are getting a bit perennial
2015-08-13T14:19:22 <Bosmon> colinclark - I\'ll try to put together a list of resolved JIRAs to go into ReleaseNotes later today
2015-08-13T14:19:37 <Justin_o> Bosmon: did we decide the first one would be called beta1? i remember deciding on pre-release.. honestly it doesn\'t matter to me though, i\'m just not sure what state you feel it is in.
2015-08-13T14:19:51 <colinclark> I just want to start using it :P
2015-08-13T14:19:52 <Bosmon> We\'ll call it 2.0.0-beta.1
2015-08-13T14:19:57 <colinclark> In npm :)
2015-08-13T14:20:19 <colinclark> Bosmon: thanks for helping with the release notes
2015-08-13T14:20:33 <Bosmon> As well as adding a pointer to our doco page on API updating
2015-08-13T14:20:44 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf was asking how to do that earlier when I told him he could start using trunk now
2015-08-13T14:21:16 <colinclark> ah wow, yes
2015-08-13T14:22:22 <colinclark> I really want to upgrade the Flocking universe soon
2015-08-13T14:22:43 <colinclark> I believe it\'ll be one of a few remaining blockers for 0.2.0
