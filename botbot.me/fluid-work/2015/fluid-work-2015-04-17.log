2015-04-17T19:01:32 <simonjb> sorry anastasiac and jhung, we are just back from a soma run
2015-04-17T19:01:45 <Justin_o> anastasiac: apart from the styling, should we also put 404 on the page?
2015-04-17T19:02:06 <simonjb> if we have time, I think it would be good to do a little styling
2015-04-17T19:02:34 <simonjb> but I would think that it\'s lower priority than fixing problems
2015-04-17T19:07:21 * slim_jim joined the channel
2015-04-17T19:08:00 <simonjb> Justin_o: can I show you my component to make sure it\'s what we both have in mind?
2015-04-17T19:08:25 <Justin_o> sure,
2015-04-17T19:14:09 <cindyli> hi Bosmon
2015-04-17T19:23:41 <jhung> anastasiac: I found a blocker? The top links are being blocked by something (maybe UIO?). You can\'t actually click on them unless you shrink the browser width until the links appear somewhere else.
2015-04-17T19:29:22 <Bosmon> Hi there cindyli
2015-04-17T19:30:14 <cindyli> Bosmon: i\'m having an issue with an integration test using IoC testing framework. let me push up the code. one sec
2015-04-17T19:31:13 <Bosmon> jhung, anastasiac, simonjb and anyone else - I did want to congratulate you on the magnificent achievment of getting our docs site up :)
2015-04-17T19:31:15 <Bosmon> It looks really great
2015-04-17T19:31:23 <Bosmon> And it is marvellous to have it after all these years
2015-04-17T19:31:53 <Bosmon> I see you\'ve already fixed the biggest styling issue I saw yesterday, that giant gap above the main page heading....
2015-04-17T19:34:28 <jhung> Bosmon: thanks! It\'s nice to have "real" docs finally. :)
2015-04-17T19:34:38 <cindyli> Bosmon: the event listener in the test that has problem - https://github.com/cindyli/first-discovery/blob/FLOE-281/tests/js/firstDiscoveryEditorTests.js#L258-L261
2015-04-17T19:34:38 <Bosmon> In case they aren\'t already high on your list, the biggest problems I ran into so far are i) the styling of "inline" code, which has the distracting rounded rectangle above it - for example on the ChangeApplierAPI page http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/ChangeApplierAPI.html I see them bashing into each other and getting broken over lines etc. - perhaps we can just get rid
2015-04-17T19:34:38 <Bosmon> of the rectangle completely when the code is inline rather than in a box
2015-04-17T19:34:54 <Bosmon> And then ii) I don\'t seem to see any link to the API section of the docs
2015-04-17T19:35:33 <Bosmon> I think this used to be there before - but for example the ChangeApplier API page appears in an odd kind of "free-floating" area called "API" which is unrelated to the other docs
2015-04-17T19:35:53 <Bosmon> Ah I see
2015-04-17T19:35:58 <Bosmon> The links are in the top panel
2015-04-17T19:36:27 <Bosmon> This really isn\'t very obvious... perhaps it would be nice to have a kind of "tabbed" style which clearly shows which section you are in
2015-04-17T19:36:48 <Bosmon> I\'m not sure that really distinguishing between "Infusion" and "API" makes any sense
2015-04-17T19:36:55 <jhung> 1. The code blocks - yes, this is a known issue. We will fix that in the future. I think the styling needs to be a little more subtle. Also there\'s a problem where code blocks which are also links don\'t have any styling to indicate that it\'s a link aside for the mouse pointer change.
2015-04-17T19:37:33 <Bosmon> Since it is the Infusion API after all - and, for example, pages like "Infusion Events" http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/InfusionEventSystem.html clearly should go together with any other documentation that we call "API"
2015-04-17T19:37:56 <Bosmon> Certainly it doesn\'t make sense to have the "ChangeApplier" in one panel and "Events" in another
2015-04-17T19:38:17 <Bosmon> And if "Inversion of Control" goes anywhere, it belongs with the others too
2015-04-17T19:38:35 <Bosmon> Well, basically everything in "Infusion" belongs with that material
2015-04-17T19:39:38 <Bosmon> Most of the material that we currently have in "API" should really go in an area called "Components"
2015-04-17T19:40:01 <Bosmon> Everything except for "ChangeApplier API", "Framework API", "DOM Binder API" which should go with "Infusion"
2015-04-17T19:40:41 <Bosmon> Everything from "Inline Edit" up to "Table of Contents" should go with "Components"
2015-04-17T19:42:40 <simonjb> thanks Bosmon, we can totally move stuff around -- would you be able to write up your suggestion for the organization that you are thinking of in an email or other medium so we can capture it?
2015-04-17T19:42:46 <Bosmon> Sure, simonjb
2015-04-17T19:42:50 <simonjb> thanks!
2015-04-17T19:43:02 <Bosmon> I\'ll be working on a GIANT PUL to the docs over the weekend too, to match my giant framework pull...
2015-04-17T19:43:11 <simonjb> :)
2015-04-17T19:43:33 <simonjb> we didn\'t give a lot of thought to the current structure
2015-04-17T19:44:11 <simonjb> it\'s a combination of re-using the structure from the wiki and some arbitrary groupings
2015-04-17T19:44:23 <simonjb> a clear, better organization would be great
2015-04-17T19:44:41 <simonjb> Bosmon ^
2015-04-17T19:44:51 <cindyli> Bosmon: the event listener that has problem - https://github.com/cindyli/first-discovery/blob/FLOE-281/tests/js/firstDiscoveryEditorTests.js#L258-L261
2015-04-17T19:44:53 <cindyli> this event listener is supposed to be executed only once as the first test, but it somehow also executed after all tests complete. also getting an error from line 482 in IoCTestUtils.js: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property \'execute\' of undefined, i guess that\'s probably from the 2nd unexpected execution of this listener.
2015-04-17T19:45:19 <cindyli> the place where the event is fired: https://github.com/cindyli/first-discovery/blob/FLOE-281/src/js/panels.js#L410
2015-04-17T19:58:21 <Bosmon> cindyli - I don\'t understand the binding of this event: https://github.com/cindyli/first-discovery/blob/FLOE-281/tests/js/firstDiscoveryEditorTests.js#L261
2015-04-17T19:58:30 <Bosmon> What could {lang firstDiscovery} possibly match?
2015-04-17T19:59:26 <Bosmon> I am terrified if this selector does actually match anything, since it suggests a horrible bug : P
2015-04-17T19:59:36 <cindyli> Bosmon: that\'s because the presence of - createOnEvent: "{langTester}.events.onTestCaseStart"
2015-04-17T19:59:38 <cindyli> at line 224
2015-04-17T20:00:05 <cindyli> if i only use {firstDiscovery}, will get an error of cannot match it on anything
2015-04-17T20:00:07 <Bosmon> Oh, I see
2015-04-17T20:00:14 <Bosmon> This is horribly confusing and dangerous
2015-04-17T20:00:21 <Bosmon> Since you have two things which could be addressed by "lang"
2015-04-17T20:00:28 <Bosmon> Since you have another thing called "gpii.firstDiscovery.panel.lang"
2015-04-17T20:00:37 <cindyli> ok
2015-04-17T20:00:41 <cindyli> let me fix that first
2015-04-17T20:00:41 <Bosmon> I didn\'t see that you also have "gpii.tests.firstDiscovery.lang"
2015-04-17T20:01:25 <cindyli> Bosmon: i have it at line 218
2015-04-17T20:01:43 <Bosmon> Yes
2015-04-17T20:01:50 <Bosmon> Your entire environment is called "lang"
2015-04-17T20:02:06 <Bosmon> In general it\'s best to avoid the use of short context names if there is any possibility of ambiguity at all
2015-04-17T20:02:14 <Bosmon> Using them is a bit like using short names for local variables
2015-04-17T20:02:25 <Bosmon> It only makes sense if you are absolutely sure that the variable resolves "locally"
2015-04-17T20:03:40 <Bosmon> I guess there\'s a chance that there is a framework bug which means that this listener is not removed properly - and that you are receiving a call to it after a firing of the second "onButtonTopsReady" event at sequence point 6
2015-04-17T20:03:43 <cindyli> Bosmon: i renamed "gpii.tests.firstDiscovery.lang" to "gpii.tests.firstDiscovery.langTests", same issue
2015-04-17T20:03:46 <Bosmon> OK cool
2015-04-17T20:03:50 <Bosmon> Can you check it in and I will test it
2015-04-17T20:03:57 <cindyli> sure. thanks
2015-04-17T20:04:39 <cindyli> Bosmon: pushed up
2015-04-17T20:04:53 <Bosmon> This line is terrifying: https://github.com/cindyli/first-discovery/blob/FLOE-281/tests/js/firstDiscoveryEditorTests.js#L271
2015-04-17T20:04:59 <Bosmon> But there is no real alternative with the current framework
2015-04-17T20:05:15 <Bosmon> After we have async ginger world, the framework will permit the use of arbitrary IoCSS selector for binding in all contexts
2015-04-17T20:05:41 <cindyli> that would be cool
2015-04-17T20:06:58 <Bosmon> Which branch, cindyli?
2015-04-17T20:07:06 <cindyli> FLOE-281
2015-04-17T20:07:11 <Bosmon> oh yes, sorry
2015-04-17T20:07:27 <cindyli> https://github.com/cindyli/first-discovery/tree/FLOE-281/
2015-04-17T20:07:48 <cindyli> Bosmon: why is that line terrifying tho?
2015-04-17T20:08:03 <Bosmon> cindyli - it\'s incredibly fragile with respect to the component structure
2015-04-17T20:08:23 <Bosmon> For the same reasons that navigating down or up in the DOM by parent or child is dangerous
2015-04-17T20:08:40 <cindyli> ok, i have quite a number of those in this test
2015-04-17T20:09:06 <Bosmon> Oh well
2015-04-17T20:09:09 <Bosmon> Can\'t be helped for the moment
2015-04-17T20:10:02 <cindyli> i wonder if this unexpected listener execution is related to the setTimeout() I use - https://github.com/cindyli/first-discovery/blob/FLOE-281/src/js/panels.js#L397
2015-04-17T20:10:15 <cindyli> Bosmon: that event is fired in the setTimeout()
2015-04-17T20:10:18 <Bosmon> Yes
2015-04-17T20:11:03 <Bosmon> But it shouldn\'t matter
2015-04-17T20:11:12 <Bosmon> The test fixture is still active, as far as the framework is concerned
2015-04-17T20:11:20 <cindyli> ok
2015-04-17T20:12:10 <Bosmon> I\'m so fed up with the structure of the IoC testing framework.... but it couldn\'t have been improved much before we had the global instantiator anyway
2015-04-17T20:12:16 <Bosmon> It\'s so hard to find where it is keeping its records
2015-04-17T20:13:27 <Bosmon> It\'s written in an "old fashioned functional style" that the author of this book would approve of ..... http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028857.do
2015-04-17T20:21:24 <cindyli> lol
2015-04-17T20:21:55 <Bosmon> cindyli - ok, I see the framework bug is severe
2015-04-17T20:22:09 <Bosmon> The system makes no attempt to unbind IoCSS-broadcast listeners at all
2015-04-17T20:22:16 <cindyli> ah ha
2015-04-17T20:22:41 <cindyli> how do we survive with this bug for so long???
2015-04-17T20:22:57 <Bosmon> Because noone every tried to fire such an event a second time within the same sequence....
2015-04-17T20:23:00 <Bosmon> ever
2015-04-17T20:23:29 <Bosmon> The problem is that the first listener is bound as {lang firstDiscovery}
2015-04-17T20:23:39 <Bosmon> And then the same event fires again as the final sequence element
2015-04-17T20:24:41 <Bosmon> As a workaround, I suggest that you just escalate the event all the way up to the gpii.tests.firstDiscovery.langTests
2015-04-17T20:25:11 <cindyli> or bind the first listener to another event, like onReady?
2015-04-17T20:25:46 <Bosmon> And just bind to it as {langTests}.events.onButtonTopsReady
2015-04-17T20:26:03 <Bosmon> No, best to avoid the IoCSS binding syntax completely now that we know it is bugged
2015-04-17T20:26:09 <Bosmon> I will JIRA it and try to solve it over the weekend
2015-04-17T20:26:29 <cindyli> ok. trying..
2015-04-17T20:26:39 <Bosmon> btw you can delegate the event more simply than you have been doing
2015-04-17T20:26:56 <Bosmon> You can just write firstDiscovery: {
2015-04-17T20:27:00 <Bosmon> events: {
2015-04-17T20:27:21 <Bosmon> onButtonTopsReady: "{langTests}.events.onButtonTopsReady"
2015-04-17T20:27:21 <Bosmon> etc
2015-04-17T20:27:39 <Bosmon> This way you ensure that there is just a single event in the system and don\'t need to worry about priority and timing etc.
2015-04-17T20:28:52 <cindyli> genius Bosmon, problem solved!
2015-04-17T20:28:57 <cindyli> thanks!!

2015-04-17T13:48:41 <Bosmon> Hi there cindyli - sorry to miss you last night
2015-04-17T13:48:49 <Bosmon> How are it going?
2015-04-17T13:48:49 <anastasiac> Justin_o, what we put into the iteration page is \xe2\x80\x9chave them type an @: if the user types shift then 2, they fail\xe2\x80\x9d
2015-04-17T13:49:19 <Justin_o> anastasiac: what if they type shift, 1, 2
2015-04-17T13:49:21 <cindyli> Bosmon: thanks for pining back. had a problem but I\'ve figured out
2015-04-17T13:49:29 <Bosmon> cindyli - cool - what was it?
2015-04-17T13:51:32 <cindyli> Bosmon: I was using IoC testing framework to write a panel test. when a button click triggers a model change event, I was expecting the panel gets refreshed automatically and receiving another afterRender
2015-04-17T13:51:40 <cindyli> but afterRender didn\'t happen
2015-04-17T13:52:23 <cindyli> I figured I would need to manually call refreshView() after the model change to have the panel re-rendered
2015-04-17T13:52:38 <Bosmon> ok
2015-04-17T13:52:43 <simonjb> Justin_o: did we decide what to do about showing an indicator for sticky keys when shift is active?
2015-04-17T13:52:46 <Bosmon> Did you have an idea why afterRender didn\'t occur?
2015-04-17T13:53:05 <Justin_o> simonjb: i haven\'t heard anything
2015-04-17T13:53:07 <cindyli> Bosmon: because I didn\'t call refreshView()?
2015-04-17T13:53:42 <Bosmon> ok
2015-04-17T13:53:44 <simonjb> Justin_o: are you available for a quick consult on my code so far?
2015-04-17T13:53:56 <Justin_o> sure

2015-04-17T14:49:28 <anastasiac> fluid-everyone: The vidyo server is still down. Do we have a back-up plan for stand-up?
2015-04-17T14:50:12 <gtirloni> anastasiac: it just came back
2015-04-17T14:50:24 * clown joined the channel
2015-04-17T14:50:42 <anastasiac> wow. I just checked before pinging about it
2015-04-17T14:50:55 <anastasiac> and actually, I\xe2\x80\x99ll probably miss stand-up anyway :-)
2015-04-17T14:51:00 <anastasiac> I\xe2\x80\x99ve got another call
2015-04-17T15:02:06 <gtirloni> we had to reboot the vidyo appliances, but it seems they are OK now. the vidyo support folks are checking them to find out what was wrong.

2015-04-17T17:53:32 <jhung> anastasiac: I updated both pull reqs 54 and 52. For 52, there was no Prefs Framework section so I added it and moved the tutorial there.
2015-04-17T17:55:24 <anastasiac> ah, shoot jhung. I was thinking of the \xe2\x80\x9cPreferences Editor\xe2\x80\x9d section, where all the rest of the prefs framework related tutorials are. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it warrants a new section; what do you think of adding it to the Prefs Editor section?
2015-04-17T18:01:46 <jhung> anastasiac: sure no prob

2015-04-17T18:18:26 <anastasiac> jhung, regarding the docs focus styling: No luck figuring out the gaps in the outline in Safari and Chrome?
2015-04-17T18:20:49 <anastasiac> simonjb, Justin_o, any opinion on the current appearance of the docs 404 page? e.g. http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/foo.html
2015-04-17T18:24:05 <jhung> anastasiac: I\'ll take a look at that in a sec.
2015-04-17T18:25:07 <anastasiac> jhung, michelled, simonjb: I\xe2\x80\x99ve issued a pull request for some docs formatting fixes that we identified as \xe2\x80\x9clooks broken\xe2\x80\x9d - #55. Who might be able to review that?
2015-04-17T18:26:32 <jhung> anastasiac: I don\'t have time right now, but maybe later this afternoon if someone else doesn\'t pick it up.
2015-04-17T18:26:40 <anastasiac> k
2015-04-17T18:30:57 <jhung> anastasiac: re. 404 page, my vote is to link to the Foundation CDN copy and use their styling.
