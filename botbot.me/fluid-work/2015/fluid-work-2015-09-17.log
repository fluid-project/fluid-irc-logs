2015-09-17T14:25:09 <Justin_o> avtar, alanharnum: we were talking about couchDB yesterday and it seems i\'m going to start working with it sooner than expected. Is there something i can use to set up a couchDB instance right now. It doesn\'t have to be all the features we need yet. I just want to start making sure the documents and views will all be working.
2015-09-17T14:25:31 <alanharnum> Justin_o avtar: the easiest thing would probably me to spin one up in a Vagrant box
2015-09-17T14:25:50 <alanharnum> do you just need an instance you can access running locally?
2015-09-17T14:29:51 <Justin_o> alanharnum: yah pretty much. if there is a simple way for me to just spin one up on my machine that would be enough
2015-09-17T14:30:03 <avtar> Justin_o, alanharnum: based on what gtirloni mentioned yesterday it sounds like the inclusivedesign/centos7 vagrant box is a good place to start
2015-09-17T14:30:07 <Justin_o> i just don\'t want to install couchdb on my host machine
2015-09-17T14:30:22 <alanharnum> Justin_o: give me a sec, Ive got a role I can repurpose that should let you spin one up in a virtualbox
2015-09-17T14:30:29 <alanharnum> Justin_o: do you have Vagrant installed?
2015-09-17T14:30:47 <Justin_o> probably not on this machine. I should go do that now i guess
2015-09-17T14:31:48 <avtar> Justin_o: just confirming, is this related to the preferences server work?
2015-09-17T14:32:12 <Justin_o> avtar: it\'s for the security work
2015-09-17T14:33:32 <avtar> ok i\'m trying to figure out where something like couchapp should get involved so that you or cindyli don\'t need to run that manually
2015-09-17T14:33:59 <Justin_o> avtar: thanks.. i appreciate that :)
2015-09-17T14:34:29 <avtar> one sec, about to jump on the red rocket
2015-09-17T14:34:39 <Justin_o> alanharnum: got vagrant installed
2015-09-17T14:36:25 <alanharnum> Justin_o: OK, let me confirm this is working for me & I\'ll give you a branch to clone
2015-09-17T14:36:57 <alanharnum> Justin_o: you should then be able to just "vagrant up" in that directory & it will provision a CouchDB VM with the default port (5984) bound between guest & host
2015-09-17T14:37:46 <Justin_o> alanharnum: i don\'t think i got the directory
2015-09-17T14:37:55 <Justin_o> or not sure which you mean
2015-09-17T14:38:16 <alanharnum> Justin_o: I mean the directory from the Git branch you\'ll clone, which I haven\'t given you yet :) sorry
2015-09-17T14:38:24 <Justin_o> oh okay :)
2015-09-17T14:41:36 <alanharnum> Justin_o: https://github.com/waharnum/idrc-ansible/tree/couchdb-local
2015-09-17T14:41:55 <alanharnum> Justin_o: clone that, switch to the couchdb-local branch, run \'vagrant up\'
2015-09-17T14:41:56 <Justin_o> alanharnum: thanks
2015-09-17T14:42:09 <alanharnum> if it doesn\'t work let me know & I\'ll come over
2015-09-17T14:42:16 <Justin_o> alanharnum: thanks for the help
2015-09-17T14:42:29 <alanharnum> this will let you just access the couchdb instance on localhost:5984 from your host
2015-09-17T14:44:10 <Justin_o> alanharnum: that\'s awesome...

2015-09-17T15:14:48 <the-t-in-rtf> I just need to be able to confirm that the cookie is set when the response is complete.  I don\'t see any kind of getter in kettle.tests.request.httpCookie.

2015-09-17T15:36:29 <the-t-in-rtf> Turns out the cookieJar stores the value of the set-cookie header and you can just parse that with anything you like.
2015-09-17T15:37:12 <the-t-in-rtf> like the cookie package you get with npm install cookie
