b'2015-10-08T22:26:37 <colinclark> I was wondering that
2015-10-08T22:26:48 <colinclark> it seems to use just very minimal parts of Fluid.js
2015-10-08T22:26:55 <colinclark> registerNamespace, etc.
2015-10-08T22:27:01 <Bosmon> And since it never appears at top level in any module tree it just happily gets its infusion nuked by dedupe
2015-10-08T22:27:08 <Bosmon> Yes
2015-10-08T22:27:11 <colinclark> right
2015-10-08T22:27:12 <colinclark> ok
2015-10-08T22:27:30 <colinclark> scary, but ok
2015-10-08T22:27:34 <Bosmon> Yes
2015-10-08T22:27:46 <Bosmon> No doubt the "thing" it depends on will itself become a micromodule some day
2015-10-08T22:27:51 <colinclark> yes
2015-10-08T22:28:02 <colinclark> I guess we probably want to publish this, too
2015-10-08T22:28:18 <colinclark> and explicitly update it to the published version of Infusion
2015-10-08T22:28:31 <colinclark> So, arguably, we could publish the current version of it as 1.0.0
2015-10-08T22:28:48 <colinclark> and then upgrade its dependency to Infusion 2.x
2015-10-08T22:28:53 <colinclark> and publish it as 2.0.0
2015-10-08T22:29:08 <colinclark> this would at least prevent it from being the primary source of additional Infusions
2015-10-08T22:37:40 <Bosmon> ha
2015-10-08T22:37:48 <Bosmon> Tough on Infusions, tough on the sources of Infusions
2015-10-08T22:38:11 <Bosmon> Is it worth publishing the current one?
2015-10-08T22:38:40 <Bosmon> Anyone currently using it today is presumably "happy" to continue resolving it from git...
2015-10-08T22:45:33 <colinclark> I suppose so

b'2015-10-08T21:04:20 <Bosmon> aha ok
2015-10-08T21:04:29 <colinclark> Though Andy Stiegler was experiencing it with his STMM node app
2015-10-08T21:04:35 <Bosmon> Ah ok
2015-10-08T21:04:39 <Bosmon> Because he depends on universal directly
2015-10-08T21:04:42 <colinclark> yes
2015-10-08T21:04:42 <Bosmon> ok, that makes sense
2015-10-08T21:04:47 <Bosmon> So the problems with windows and linux aren\'t urgent
2015-10-08T21:04:57 <Bosmon> And also this explains why we didn\'t observe this problem more frequently before
2015-10-08T21:05:10 <Bosmon> Standard arch distros of the GPII are fine
2015-10-08T21:05:28 <Bosmon> Because the dedupe is explicitly sequenced in grunt\'s "gpii-universal" task
2015-10-08T21:05:50 <colinclark> Man, I\'m so excited about our crazy version number
2015-10-08T21:05:55 <colinclark> https://www.npmjs.com/package/infusion
2015-10-08T21:06:00 <colinclark> and all our Collaborators!
2015-10-08T21:06:18 <colinclark> you are a strange sort of bug, Bosmon
2015-10-08T21:06:34 <Bosmon> Yes I have always thought so
2015-10-08T21:14:06 <Bosmon> Ok I have stopped being a BUGGE now
2015-10-08T21:14:33 <colinclark> Now you look like a DISTINGUISHED ARCHITECT
2015-10-08T21:15:58 * sepidehshahi has left the channel
2015-10-08T21:19:24 <Bosmon> At least like a somewhat eccentric bowler
2015-10-08T21:30:04 <colinclark> I remember that time we went bowling
2015-10-08T21:30:09 <colinclark> for a Fluid Project event
2015-10-08T21:30:26 <colinclark> If I remember, you did have a somewhat eccentric technique
2015-10-08T21:38:17 <colinclark> Oh, I guess we should publish our new micromodule to npm, Bosmon
2015-10-08T21:38:22 <colinclark> Shall I go ahead and do that?
2015-10-08T21:40:08 <Bosmon> colinclark - oh, sure
2015-10-08T21:40:16 <Bosmon> I guess that will be fun
2015-10-08T21:40:26 <colinclark> I was just about to update universal\'s package.json and realized we should really be sourcing it from npm, not git
2015-10-08T21:40:33 <Bosmon> We will be responsible for over 1% of the world\'s newly published npm modules for today :)
2015-10-08T21:40:34 <colinclark> based on our earlier conversation
2015-10-08T21:40:36 <colinclark> hahaha
2015-10-08T21:40:45 <Bosmon> Yes
2015-10-08T21:41:27 <colinclark> Interestingly, I realized that this was Fluid\'s first BSD-only project
2015-10-08T21:41:36 <colinclark> I\'d really like to start ditching the ECL 2 from our licenses
2015-10-08T21:41:45 <colinclark> at least for new modules
2015-10-08T21:41:46 <Bosmon> Was that a requirement from Mellon?
2015-10-08T21:42:04 <colinclark> Yes, it was in the original consortium agreement
2015-10-08T21:42:09 <Bosmon> ok
2015-10-08T21:47:44 <colinclark> Bosmon: https://www.npmjs.com/package/dedupe-infusion
2015-10-08T21:48:01 <Bosmon> colinclark - magnificent
2015-10-08T21:48:35 <Bosmon> I guess it takes collaborators as everyone with commit access rather than from the commit log
2015-10-08T21:50:24 <colinclark> no, you have to add them manually
2015-10-08T21:50:29 <Bosmon> Well, I guess it can\'t - github claims that the committers group membership is "secret"
2015-10-08T21:50:31 <colinclark> I copied Infusion\'s
2015-10-08T21:50:31 <Bosmon> Aha
2015-10-08T21:50:42 <colinclark> that\'s odd that the membership is secret
2015-10-08T21:50:46 <colinclark> it\'s published on our wiki, intentionally
2015-10-08T21:51:51 <Bosmon> I can make our "team membership" on github public
2015-10-08T21:52:13 <colinclark> sure, I think that\'s fine
2015-10-08T21:52:39 <Bosmon> ok done
2015-10-08T21:52:43 <colinclark> Bosmon: As far as you know, should it be possible to run the unit tests from a plain universal?
2015-10-08T21:52:52 <Bosmon> colinclark yes
2015-10-08T21:52:55 <colinclark> hmm
2015-10-08T21:52:57 <colinclark> I\'m getting errors
2015-10-08T21:52:59 <Bosmon> Yes
2015-10-08T21:53:09 <colinclark> 17:52:22.817:  FATAL ERROR: Uncaught exception: Cannot find module \'universal\'
2015-10-08T21:53:14 <Bosmon> With the one proviso that the plain universal is in a directory named "node_modules"
2015-10-08T21:53:18 <colinclark> hahaha
2015-10-08T21:53:20 <Bosmon> This is mentioned in the README I think
2015-10-08T21:53:24 <colinclark> we are such dorks
2015-10-08T21:53:26 <colinclark> yes, sorry
2015-10-08T21:53:32 <Bosmon> Well, we are kind of dorks
2015-10-08T21:53:33 <colinclark> I\'m just reading the diff
2015-10-08T21:53:45 <Bosmon> Which diff - for my pull?
2015-10-08T21:53:55 <colinclark> "For development purposes this repository could be cloned directly - however, please ensure that it is housed in a directory named node_modules otherwise its test cases will not be able to self-resolve."
2015-10-08T21:53:56 <colinclark> yes
2015-10-08T21:53:58 <colinclark> for your pull
2015-10-08T21:54:16 <colinclark> but I just don\'t read well
2015-10-08T21:54:24 <colinclark> it\'s even up there at the top of the diff
2015-10-08T21:54:41 <Bosmon> Well, it\'s a peculiar requirement, I guess
2015-10-08T21:54:59 <Bosmon> But I guess npm and node aren\'t really geared up for "megamodules" of the kind we have
2015-10-08T21:55:24 <Bosmon> Perhaps we will now turn universal itself into 50 micromodules....
2015-10-08T21:55:41 <Bosmon> But I guess only in the case we can be completely sure that our deduping nightmares are firmly behind us
2015-10-08T21:55:42 <colinclark> Simon will be so excited
2015-10-08T21:56:01 <colinclark> as soon as I\'m done reviewing this pull, I\'ll start to investigate that
2015-10-08T21:56:06 <Bosmon> awesome
2015-10-08T21:57:19 <colinclark> It\'s pretty great to see these tests running on my mac
2015-10-08T21:57:25 <colinclark> I\'ve only ever done GPII development in a VM
2015-10-08T21:57:31 <colinclark> this is reverse avtar-ism in action
2015-10-08T21:57:44 <colinclark> he is weeping at my enthusiasm right now
2015-10-08T21:58:59 <colinclark> avtar: Speaking of that, you mentioned that you wanted to talk about test reporters
2015-10-08T21:59:11 <avtar> yes
2015-10-08T21:59:51 <avtar> this is the qunit junit reporter that i came across https://github.com/JamesMGreene/qunit-reporter-junit
2015-10-08T22:00:53 <colinclark> Just so I understand
2015-10-08T22:00:53 <avtar> i got the impression that it isn\'t being maintained actively based on their open PRs
2015-10-08T22:01:04 <colinclark> you need to be able to log test results in the JUnit format
2015-10-08T22:01:09 <colinclark> so that Jenkins can make sense of it?
2015-10-08T22:01:15 <avtar> yes
2015-10-08T22:01:30 <avtar> i guess it doesn\'t have to be junit
2015-10-08T22:01:36 <avtar> any format that it can parse https://github.com/twada/qunit-tap
2015-10-08T22:02:08 <colinclark> TAP or JUnit XML, practically-speaking
2015-10-08T22:02:20 <avtar> yup
2015-10-08T22:02:27 <colinclark> I guess the issue with any QUnit reporter is if it\'s really going to be compatible with Bosmon\'s custom reporter for jqUnit
2015-10-08T22:03:58 <Bosmon> "I don\'t see any reason why it shouldn\'t be"
2015-10-08T22:04:56 <Bosmon> The bigger problem will be getting it to run in node
2015-10-08T22:05:20 <Bosmon> Oh weird
2015-10-08T22:05:24 <Bosmon> It has an "XMLWriter" inside it
2015-10-08T22:05:31 <colinclark> QUnit TAP claims to support it
2015-10-08T22:05:33 <avtar> https://github.com/JamesMGreene/qunit-reporter-junit/pull/10
2015-10-08T22:05:44 <avtar> https://github.com/JamesMGreene/qunit-reporter-junit/pull/15
2015-10-08T22:06:05 <avtar> those were the two PRs that caught my eye
2015-10-08T22:06:07 <colinclark> I guess this is your concern, eh?
2015-10-08T22:06:14 <avtar> yes
2015-10-08T22:06:22 <colinclark> J\xc3\xb6rn says "A strict XML parser that bails on extra attributes is kind of broken."
2015-10-08T22:06:39 <colinclark> how does the TAP plugin look to you, avtar?
2015-10-08T22:08:15 <avtar> it seems more promising
2015-10-08T22:08:19 <colinclark> okay, it\'s in, Bosmon: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/package.json#L10
2015-10-08T22:08:25 <Bosmon> colinclark - fantastic
2015-10-08T22:08:32 <Bosmon> We are progressing by LEAPPES and BOUNDDES
2015-10-08T22:08:51 <avtar> it appears to be actively maintained and might be a better option than maintaining a fork of the qunit reporter
2015-10-08T22:09:00 <avtar> *junit
2015-10-08T22:09:04 <colinclark> avtar: It does seem a little cleaner
2015-10-08T22:09:20 <colinclark> Do you imagine that we will have a special grunt task that will run the tests with this special reporter?
2015-10-08T22:09:24 <colinclark> Or something to that effect?
2015-10-08T22:09:43 <avtar> that\'s the other task
2015-10-08T22:10:00 <colinclark> Bosmon: This issue we\'re discussing here is the last major blocker, I believe, to fully automated Infusion testing on multiple browsers
2015-10-08T22:10:12 <colinclark> I can\'t wait until we also have testem in place
2015-10-08T22:10:25 <colinclark> so we can automatically run tests on all our browsers just by running "npm test"
2015-10-08T22:10:28 <colinclark> or whatever
2015-10-08T22:11:10 <Bosmon> super
2015-10-08T22:11:33 <avtar> colinclark: it seems to be that the gpii/linux shell script will need to be replaced with a grunt task that can run the tests
2015-10-08T22:11:51 <avtar> sigh s/be/me/
2015-10-08T22:11:52 <colinclark> which shell script, avtar?
2015-10-08T22:11:54 <Bosmon> Ok, so we will run this reporter both in the browser as well as in node.js?
2015-10-08T22:12:42 <avtar> colinclark: https://github.com/GPII/linux/blob/master/tests/UnitTests.sh
2015-10-08T22:13:17 <colinclark> ah, interesting
2015-10-08T22:13:23 <avtar> there are two separate scenarios where we want reporters
2015-10-08T22:13:28 <colinclark> A grunt task to do this will be fine, I imagine
2015-10-08T22:13:45 <colinclark> would an npm script also work, avtar?
2015-10-08T22:14:07 <avtar> the first is with node-jqunit which can create a tap report that can be consumed by jenkins
2015-10-08T22:14:28 <avtar> the second is a reporter that can be used by testem for browser tests
2015-10-08T22:16:19 <colinclark> avtar: My advice is to try qunit-tap first
2015-10-08T22:16:21 <colinclark> see how it goes
2015-10-08T22:16:37 <colinclark> let\'s stay away from the project that doesn\'t seem to bother to merge pull requests anymore
2015-10-08T22:16:53 <avtar> sounds good
2015-10-08T22:18:01 <colinclark> It\'s certainly fairly active
2015-10-08T22:18:08 <colinclark> a one-developer project
2015-10-08T22:18:10 <colinclark> but I dig those :)
2015-10-08T22:18:36 <avtar> i was thinking of getting node-jqunit to detect the presence of an environment variable that would indicate that tests are being run by a ci server
2015-10-08T22:18:45 <avtar> in which case it should use the tap reporter
2015-10-08T22:18:55 <avtar> otherwise go about its way as it normally does
2015-10-08T22:23:36 <colinclark> That seems reasonable to me
2015-10-08T22:24:58 <colinclark> Bosmon: I find myself confused in a way I shouldn\'t be
2015-10-08T22:25:04 <colinclark> jqUnit depends on Infusion
2015-10-08T22:25:28 <colinclark> but it requires OLD infusion
2015-10-08T22:25:52 <colinclark> is that correct?
2015-10-08T22:25:59 <Bosmon> Yes, bizarrely it is
2015-10-08T22:26:06 <colinclark> So how does it work?
2015-10-08T22:26:09 <colinclark> :)
2015-10-08T22:26:16 <Bosmon> It\'s a sample of what is currently an annoyance but in future might be a wreck : P
2015-10-08T22:26:26 <Bosmon> Well, it depends on so little of infusion it really doesn\'t care what version it gets
'

b'2015-10-08T20:09:04 <Bosmon> Justin_o - this plugin seemed to lint just fine
2015-10-08T20:09:06 <Bosmon> er module
2015-10-08T20:09:32 <Bosmon> Just think, we are ferociously working away to producing our quota of 346 npm modules per day :)
2015-10-08T20:09:33 <Justin_o> Bosmon: maybe it\'s using a different config.. the one in infusion doesn\'t like it
2015-10-08T20:09:47 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I removed the "browser" flag from it
2015-10-08T20:09:53 <Bosmon> Feel free to copy this module as a template
2015-10-08T20:09:58 <Bosmon> It has very nearly passed its review process : P
2015-10-08T20:10:22 <Justin_o> Bosmon: this is what i have so far https://github.com/jobara/infusion/blob/FLUID-5789/publish.js
2015-10-08T20:10:31 <Justin_o> which would probably work if i removed all the test stuff
2015-10-08T20:10:41 <Bosmon> Justin_o - looks good
2015-10-08T20:10:43 <Justin_o> i\'ll want to be able to take in command line arguments for a test build option
2015-10-08T20:10:59 <Justin_o> i\'m heading out now, but i\'ll pick this up next week
2015-10-08T20:11:31 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, it looks like npm scripts can accept command line args
2015-10-08T20:11:36 <Bosmon> I was just reading up on this
2015-10-08T20:11:47 <Bosmon> https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/5518
2015-10-08T20:12:24 <Justin_o> Bosmon: excellent, thanks
2015-10-08T20:13:10 <Bosmon> As far as I can see, this is the closest route to something resembling a "node script"
2015-10-08T20:13:19 <Bosmon> Well
2015-10-08T20:13:23 <Bosmon> Yes
2015-10-08T20:13:36 <Bosmon> Because the problem is, something has to actually "require" the thing, if it is hosted in a module
2015-10-08T20:13:56 <Bosmon> And the only thing I could see that might do that, if it is not grunt, would be npm
2015-10-08T20:14:10 <Bosmon> Of course we could invoke the module via either grunt or npm, it doesn\'t matter too much
2015-10-08T20:14:22 <Bosmon> But it seems nice for the script itself not to have a dependency on grunt.......
2015-10-08T20:14:41 <Bosmon> Because that just raises all the standard horrors about whether grunt is a devDependency or not
2015-10-08T20:14:49 <Bosmon> I\'m not sure, I may not be thinking completely clearly
2015-10-08T20:14:56 <Bosmon> Do someone comment if anything strikes you about this
2015-10-08T20:15:58 <Bosmon> https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/run-script
2015-10-08T20:16:07 <Bosmon> The only awkwardness with npm as a host is this dorky "--" business
2015-10-08T20:17:29 <Bosmon> Although possibly from memory this is somewhat less dorky than the equivalent hassle of getting command line arguments into a grunt ask
2015-10-08T20:18:01 <Bosmon> task
2015-10-08T20:18:46 <Bosmon> In that it allows just a single string following a ":" or something ridiculous like that
2015-10-08T20:34:02 <anastasiac> cindyli: where would I find the latest fd tool code, i.e. the version updated to the latest Infusion? Is that in master, or in somenoe\xe2\x80\x99s branch?
2015-10-08T20:36:13 <colinclark> Bosmon: just catching up now, sorry i missed your ping earlier
2015-10-08T20:36:20 <colinclark> i merged the new dedupe-infusion repo, btw
2015-10-08T20:36:29 <colinclark> fixed one of your license headers
2015-10-08T20:36:32 <Bosmon> colinclark - awesome! thanks
2015-10-08T20:38:46 <colinclark> I think we\'re all on the same page
2015-10-08T20:39:04 <colinclark> it sounds like there\'s no real reason to prefer, in many cases, grunt vs. plain JS micromodules
2015-10-08T20:39:15 <colinclark> but in general, probably sensible to avoid binding to Grunt\'s API unless we really need it
2015-10-08T20:39:26 <Bosmon> Wow, we\'re so hipp :)
2015-10-08T20:39:44 <colinclark> it is interesting that, for whatever reason, Hood.ie is rewriting their extensive set of Grunt tasks as plain JS run as npm scripts
2015-10-08T20:40:15 <Bosmon> colinclark - that is very interesting
2015-10-08T20:40:25 <Bosmon> Any idea of their rationale?
2015-10-08T20:40:42 <colinclark> No, I only saw it in passing that day that I was researching hood.ie for a student here at OCAD
2015-10-08T20:40:46 <colinclark> it\'s a very inspiring community
2015-10-08T20:40:52 <Bosmon> Yes
2015-10-08T20:40:58 <Bosmon> I hope we can connect with it more and more in future
2015-10-08T20:40:59 <colinclark> and a tool that strikes me as perfect for learning to program
2015-10-08T20:41:14 <colinclark> in the past, students would very quickly be taught MySQL and PHP
2015-10-08T20:41:20 <colinclark> and suddenly everything changes
2015-10-08T20:41:30 <colinclark> in terms of the complexity curve
2015-10-08T20:41:36 <colinclark> to go from editing HTML and CSS on your local computer in a browser
2015-10-08T20:41:43 <Bosmon> And I guess to the increasing extent that we can produce independently reusable micromodules, I guess we can
2015-10-08T20:41:47 <colinclark> to suddenly needing PHP plugins, web servers, databases, etc.
2015-10-08T20:41:53 <colinclark> yes, I agree Bosmon
2015-10-08T20:42:18 <Bosmon> Setting aside the long-looming issue of how we actually package infusion itself - it\'s clear that it has a role within the micromodule community itself
2015-10-08T20:42:33 <Bosmon> As your upcoming "micrometadata" project will start to reveal
2015-10-08T20:42:33 <colinclark> it\'s going to be so awesome
2015-10-08T20:42:44 <Bosmon> Did you notice that my plugin already includes a small piece of micrometadata :)
2015-10-08T20:43:16 <colinclark> defaultOptions!
2015-10-08T20:43:20 <Bosmon> yes!!
2015-10-08T20:43:28 <colinclark> yes, I did see that when I reviewed it
2015-10-08T20:43:54 <colinclark> We are going to need to start to spec some of this stuff out on wiki pages
2015-10-08T20:44:00 <Bosmon> Yes
2015-10-08T20:44:13 <colinclark> and I guess if I do some work in this regard, it will be part of the fluid-project org
2015-10-08T20:44:17 <colinclark> or fluid-studios or something
2015-10-08T20:44:20 <Bosmon> It\'s probably only a small step from here to be able to produce a kind of "travelling armour" for infusion components masquerading as micromodules
2015-10-08T20:44:32 <colinclark> yes
2015-10-08T20:45:17 <Bosmon> In theory we can produce a kind of "microinfusion" that basically does what Infusion 1.2 used to do or whatever version it is
2015-10-08T20:45:29 <Bosmon> That is, can instantiate a component in an IoC-free way
2015-10-08T20:45:42 <Bosmon> That is, just a single component
2015-10-08T20:45:47 <colinclark> For the unit generator universe!
2015-10-08T20:45:51 <Bosmon> Yes, for that
2015-10-08T20:46:01 <colinclark> I was sitting there thinking about what I will need to add to Flocking\'s unit generator support
2015-10-08T20:46:05 <Bosmon> And other low-profile, low-garbage environments
2015-10-08T20:46:06 <colinclark> to make it a little better
2015-10-08T20:46:08 <colinclark> yes
2015-10-08T20:46:26 <colinclark> And I realized that what I needed was pretty well exactly the old Infusion framework
2015-10-08T20:46:32 <colinclark> only more memory-optimized
2015-10-08T20:46:42 <Bosmon> This split is actually still MOSTLY still reflected in our file factoring
2015-10-08T20:46:48 <colinclark> yes
2015-10-08T20:46:58 <Bosmon> THat is, it is still possible for just Fluid.js by itself to instantiate certain extremely vestigial kinds of components
2015-10-08T20:48:19 <Bosmon> I still worry about how absolutely dog slow npm still is
2015-10-08T20:48:32 <Bosmon> But I still dream that this might just be because of the numerous git dependencies we still have
2015-10-08T20:48:36 <colinclark> no
2015-10-08T20:48:38 <colinclark> It\'s very, very slow
2015-10-08T20:48:50 <colinclark> Well, I guess I should say flat out "no"
2015-10-08T20:49:02 <colinclark> let me check osc.js, which I don\'t think has any git dependencies
2015-10-08T20:49:06 <Bosmon> I can\'t understand why it is so dog slow, because it really does so little
2015-10-08T20:49:09 <colinclark> but it seems universally slow to me
2015-10-08T20:49:22 <Bosmon> Presumably then it\'s because the registry is slow
2015-10-08T20:49:35 <Bosmon> But even that does so little too
2015-10-08T20:49:41 * Nadia1 has left the channel
2015-10-08T20:49:47 <Bosmon> I remember those horrid days of having to construct "local Maven caches" : P
2015-10-08T20:50:16 <colinclark> It is faster without Git repos, for sure
2015-10-08T20:50:23 <colinclark> and osc.js does actually have to build things
2015-10-08T20:50:47 <colinclark> about half of its dependencies contain native code
2015-10-08T20:50:54 <Bosmon> ok
2015-10-08T20:51:45 <colinclark> did Justin_o managed to publish today?
2015-10-08T20:51:52 <Bosmon> A manual one, yes
2015-10-08T20:52:05 <Bosmon> And he\'s been pushing on with his publishing script
2015-10-08T20:52:17 <Bosmon> Which we decided to try to model on my "micromodule"
2015-10-08T20:52:18 <colinclark> a really artistic version number!
2015-10-08T20:52:20 <colinclark> 2.0.0-dev.20151007T134312Z.8c33cd4
2015-10-08T20:52:23 <colinclark> yes, I saw that part
2015-10-08T20:52:32 <colinclark> okay, I really should upgrade my modules
2015-10-08T20:52:43 <Bosmon> And try to consume this release?
2015-10-08T20:52:46 <Bosmon> That will be fun
2015-10-08T20:52:48 <colinclark> and verify if we can, for many practical purposes, ditch dedupe-infusion altogether
2015-10-08T20:52:51 <colinclark> yes
2015-10-08T20:52:55 <Bosmon> awesome
2015-10-08T20:53:16 <Bosmon> Could you also deal with the matching pull for universal as well?
2015-10-08T20:53:22 <Bosmon> I guess I should make ones for windows and linux too
2015-10-08T20:53:28 <Bosmon> Given those are the more important ones
2015-10-08T20:53:48 <colinclark> yes, I will for sure
2015-10-08T20:54:50 <Bosmon> cheers
2015-10-08T20:55:32 <colinclark> we really should also update our build process
2015-10-08T20:55:40 <colinclark> I got about 50% of the way in a branch
2015-10-08T20:55:47 <colinclark> but the build is quite "backwards"
2015-10-08T20:55:47 <Bosmon> For Infusion?
2015-10-08T20:55:49 <colinclark> yes
2015-10-08T20:55:51 <Bosmon> Ah
2015-10-08T20:55:52 <Bosmon> How so
2015-10-08T20:56:03 <gtirloni> Justin_o: with the latest changes to the nodejs role, you may want to change these lines https://github.com/jobara/first-discovery-server/blob/master/provisioning/vars.yml#L18-L19  into this http://pastie.org/10469002
2015-10-08T20:56:03 * anvk has quit
2015-10-08T20:56:12 <colinclark> well, it is very modal
2015-10-08T20:56:20 <colinclark> either minification or not
2015-10-08T20:56:29 <colinclark> quite difficult under the current model to do both
2015-10-08T20:56:50 <Bosmon> Yes
2015-10-08T20:56:55 <colinclark> what we want is to be able to build framework-only and infusion-all builds as part of a prepublish script
2015-10-08T20:56:56 <Bosmon> I guess a lot of that is grunt\'s crappy modality
2015-10-08T20:57:02 <colinclark> No
2015-10-08T20:57:05 <colinclark> it\'s just the way the build was created
2015-10-08T20:57:10 <Bosmon> ok
2015-10-08T20:57:14 <colinclark> it was built from a particular mindset
2015-10-08T20:57:19 <colinclark> which was totally sensible in 2008
2015-10-08T20:57:29 <colinclark> we used Ant to produce "pacakges" for us
2015-10-08T20:57:32 <colinclark> packages
2015-10-08T20:57:32 <Bosmon> ANT!
2015-10-08T20:57:37 <Bosmon> !!!
2015-10-08T20:59:13 <gtirloni> someone get the alcohol and some matches, we\'ve got to sterilize this channel now
2015-10-08T21:00:45 * clown has quit
2015-10-08T21:01:22 <Bosmon> Ok so I\'m very puzzled now about the problems Justin_o and gtirloni seemed to be having with dedupe
2015-10-08T21:01:54 <Bosmon> SInce I am looking at grunt-gpii now and I see it invokes the dedupe DEFINITELY AFTER it has installed universal
2015-10-08T21:02:15 <Bosmon> Could someone remind me of the exact circumstances of the problem?
2015-10-08T21:02:34 <gtirloni> npm calls postinstall in the middle of things when not all deps are installed yet
2015-10-08T21:02:59 <Bosmon> Yes
2015-10-08T21:03:05 <Bosmon> But which project exactly were you installing?
2015-10-08T21:03:13 <Bosmon> grunt-gpii doesn\'t rely on postinstall at all
2015-10-08T21:04:16 <colinclark> It was Justin_o\'s FD server, Bosmon
'

b'2015-10-08T16:47:18 <Bosmon2> That removes the guest addins warning, unfortunately the rsync problem is just the same
2015-10-08T16:47:20 * Bosmon2 is now known as Bosmon
2015-10-08T16:47:45 <gtirloni> i\'d destroy and `up` the box again just in case
2015-10-08T16:48:42 <Bosmon> gtirloni - I ran "destroy" and it gave another rsync-related failure
2015-10-08T16:48:56 <Bosmon> I\'m wondering, btw, how you are planning to rely on rsync-based infrastructure on a Windows host
2015-10-08T16:49:00 <avtar> Bosmon, Bosmon2: i\'ll have an update very soon which will mean rsync won\'t be required for file syncing
2015-10-08T16:49:04 <Bosmon> I happen to have it installed, but I imagine the vast majority of people won\'t
2015-10-08T16:49:10 <Bosmon> avtar - cool
2015-10-08T16:49:12 <avtar> i\'m curious though
2015-10-08T16:49:44 <avtar> are you using openssh and rsync installed using cygwin?
2015-10-08T16:50:05 <Bosmon> avtar - yes
2015-10-08T16:50:50 <avtar> has vagrant worked for you in the past?
2015-10-08T16:51:11 <Bosmon> gtirloni - after "up" again, same rsync error
2015-10-08T16:51:21 <Bosmon> avtar - no, I\'ve never tried it before
2015-10-08T16:51:31 <Bosmon> I just installed it yesterday to try to verify Justin_o \'s pull request
2015-10-08T16:51:36 <avtar> ah ok
2015-10-08T16:52:11 <avtar> could you please try \'vagrant halt\', start up the virtualbox gui, and then try starting this new vm from there?
2015-10-08T16:52:30 <avtar> i\'m wondering if the windows firewall is blocking access
2015-10-08T16:53:20 <avtar> "Windows users will need to..." https://github.com/avtar/development-environments/blob/master/README.md#requirements
2015-10-08T16:53:38 <avtar> those were the two issues i encountered when trying this on a test windows machine
2015-10-08T16:54:04 <Bosmon> !!
2015-10-08T16:54:08 <Bosmon> edit the /etc/fstab file!
2015-10-08T16:54:18 <avtar> which now looking at my own readme i can see how "Make sure the Windows firewall is not restricting Vagrant or VirtualBox" is very different from what i\'m asking you to do right now :/
2015-10-08T16:54:31 <Bosmon> I can\'t possibly do that.... I have a zillion things which depend on cygwin\'s built-in prefixes : P
2015-10-08T16:54:35 <Justin_o> Bosmon: while you are trying to get your vm to work, i have a question about dates. So it seems that the date objects getUTCMonth method returns OCT as 9 instead of 10
2015-10-08T16:55:10 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I can refer you to this prior art: https://github.com/rsf/RSFComponents/blob/master/templates/src/webapp/content/js/ISO8601-date.js#L15
2015-10-08T16:55:13 * michelled has quit
2015-10-08T16:55:31 <Bosmon> avtar yes, I did allow access via the Windows firewall
2015-10-08T16:55:38 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks, so that\'s expected
2015-10-08T16:55:38 <Bosmon> The VM itself seems to start up ok
2015-10-08T16:55:49 <Justin_o> you don\'t seem to be adding leading 0\'s though
2015-10-08T16:55:57 <Justin_o> which we had in our example string
2015-10-08T16:56:03 <gtirloni> it seems the provisioning phase is not correctly deploying the ssh key, if `vagrant ssh` isn\'t working too.. that might be it
2015-10-08T16:56:09 <Justin_o> Bosmon: should we be adding those
2015-10-08T16:56:10 <Bosmon> Justin_o - zeros are here: https://github.com/rsf/RSFComponents/blob/master/templates/src/webapp/content/js/ISO8601-date.js#L68
2015-10-08T16:56:16 <Bosmon> I can assure that this impl actually works : P
2015-10-08T16:56:22 <Bosmon> Justin_o - of course
2015-10-08T16:56:29 * michelled joined the channel
2015-10-08T16:56:33 <Justin_o> Bosmon: ah okay
2015-10-08T16:56:51 <Bosmon> Just need to adapt to remove the separators
2015-10-08T16:57:23 <avtar> Bosmon: https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/issues/4073#issuecomment-62351020
2015-10-08T16:57:33 <avtar> i\'m kidding btw
2015-10-08T16:57:39 <avtar> but if you can move to linux...
2015-10-08T16:57:45 <avtar> one sec
2015-10-08T16:57:45 <Bosmon> Yes, hilarious
2015-10-08T17:00:18 <Bosmon> As far as I can see, vagrant ssh seems to work, after some complaints
2015-10-08T17:00:33 <Bosmon> But unfortunately editing my fstab is a nonstarted for me on this machine
2015-10-08T17:00:36 <Bosmon> nonstarter
2015-10-08T17:03:56 <Bosmon> As I was just remarking to colinclark, at least this exercise reminded me where my OS/2 Warp 4 VM was :)
2015-10-08T17:04:52 <avtar> Bosmon: if possible could we try this after my update? i know i had to change the cygwin prefix at least for rsync to work but we should be able to move forward without that
2015-10-08T17:05:06 <Bosmon> avtar - sure
2015-10-08T17:05:14 <Bosmon> I\'m sure that getting rsync out of the picture will make a big difference
2015-10-08T17:05:57 <Bosmon> avtar - what method will you now use to get the files into the container?
2015-10-08T17:06:17 <avtar> plain ol virtual box shared folders
2015-10-08T17:06:26 <Bosmon> plain ol!
2015-10-08T17:06:27 <avtar> and fall back to nfs or smb if performance is an issue
2015-10-08T17:06:39 <Bosmon> How can that be automated?
2015-10-08T17:07:04 <Bosmon> I bet you a ha\'penny bun to half a pound of dried bananas it won\'t work :)
2015-10-08T17:07:05 <avtar> performance was an issue when gpii/universal was larger before it was pruned
2015-10-08T17:07:19 <colinclark> One thing that occurs to me...
2015-10-08T17:07:28 <avtar> penny bun?
2015-10-08T17:07:34 <colinclark> is that I have a feeling Docker\'s experience for this kind of thing is probably a bit more polished on Windows
2015-10-08T17:07:35 <Bosmon> halfpenny bun
2015-10-08T17:07:42 <Bosmon> High odds :)
2015-10-08T17:07:43 <colinclark> given Microsofts huge investment in Docker these days

2015-10-08T17:10:07 <Bosmon> avtar - https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/synced-folders/basic_usage.html ?
2015-10-08T17:10:10 <Bosmon> These?
2015-10-08T17:15:48 <Bosmon> I guess rsync is actually what vagrant uses to implement this.............
2015-10-08T17:18:39 <Bosmon> But in which case it\'s really unclear what problem this solves - if a user can install VirtualBox, cygwin and rsync and deal with the prefixing issues, they can certainly install a working dev environment
2015-10-08T17:18:50 <Bosmon> It does seem as if this in theory works better on Docker: https://docs.docker.com/userguide/dockervolumes/

2015-10-08T19:44:22 <jhung> thanks alanharnum. I got that running, but I was hoping the github desktop client worked with git-lfs, but it seems to get hung up on generating the diff preview.
2015-10-08T19:44:38 <alanharnum> jhung: boo urns
2015-10-08T19:44:44 <alanharnum> :(
2015-10-08T19:45:31 <jhung> it was trying to display a diff for a PDF\xe2\x80\xa6 I would have liked to have seen what it thought was a diff. But it decided to crash instead alanharnum.

2015-10-08T19:57:15 <Justin_o> colinclark, Bosmon: i\'m working on the basics of a script to run publish dev builds to npm
2015-10-08T19:57:21 <Bosmon> Justin_o - awesome
2015-10-08T19:57:32 <Justin_o> should it be a node script or a grunt task?
2015-10-08T19:57:41 <Bosmon> Justin_o - an excellent question
2015-10-08T19:58:30 <Bosmon> I wanted to refer you again to my interesting discovery that I pasted earlier - https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/402/files#diff-b9cfc7f2cdf78a7f4b91a753d10865a2R53
2015-10-08T19:58:38 <Bosmon> Since this expands the range of alternatives available to us
2015-10-08T19:59:23 <Bosmon> But I think there isn\'t a reason this can\'t be a grunt task
2015-10-08T19:59:42 <Bosmon> Which presumably papers over the annoyance about the lack of a synchronous shell task in node < 0.12
2015-10-08T20:00:00 <Justin_o> oh i found something that helps with that
2015-10-08T20:00:10 <Justin_o> child_process.exexSync
2015-10-08T20:00:11 <Bosmon> Yes, there is an npm module for it
2015-10-08T20:00:17 <Justin_o> execSync
2015-10-08T20:00:19 <Bosmon> Justin_o - that is the API which isn\'t available
2015-10-08T20:00:29 <Justin_o> Bosmon: it\'s working :)
2015-10-08T20:00:32 <Bosmon> If you scroll back to the node 0.10 documentation you will see that it isn\'t there
2015-10-08T20:00:37 <Justin_o> maybe because i have more recent version of npm
2015-10-08T20:01:05 <Bosmon> Sadly we need to support node 0.10 for just one month longer
2015-10-08T20:01:41 <Justin_o> does infusion need to support 0.10?
2015-10-08T20:01:54 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes
2015-10-08T20:01:56 <Justin_o> :(
2015-10-08T20:02:00 <Bosmon> Although you could argue that this build script doesn\'t
2015-10-08T20:03:33 <Justin_o> Bosmon: right, because it\'ll be run by the build server
2015-10-08T20:03:49 <Bosmon> Justin_o - so sure, go ahead and make this a standard node script
2015-10-08T20:03:53 <Justin_o> i\'ll move it to grunt anyways, but maybe i\'ll commit what i have for now so i don\'t lose it by accident
2015-10-08T20:04:12 <Bosmon> Do you think that\'s reasonable, colinclark ?
2015-10-08T20:04:13 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i\'m fine with either
2015-10-08T20:04:18 <Justin_o> colinclark: ^
2015-10-08T20:04:55 <Bosmon> My recent experience making a "bare script" suggests that there\'s not really much that\'s done by grunt that isn\'t roughly as easy without it
2015-10-08T20:05:36 <Justin_o> Bosmon: can you send me a link to that script
2015-10-08T20:06:04 <Bosmon> Justin_o - sure - you can see my in-progress pull request here: https://github.com/fluid-project/dedupe-infusion/pull/1
2015-10-08T20:06:35 <Bosmon> I guess you could well follow this pattern in case we want to use your release script in others of our projects
2015-10-08T20:07:22 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes, that would help
2015-10-08T20:07:31 <Justin_o> Bosmon: so no closures in node apps?
2015-10-08T20:08:35 <Bosmon> Since invoking scripts like this from npm is as easy as the node -e command that I pasted earlier
2015-10-08T20:08:39 <Bosmon> Justin_o - no, there\'s no need for them
2015-10-08T20:08:48 <Bosmon> node isolation is already ferocious enough : P
2015-10-08T20:08:54 <Justin_o> Bosmon: we have a problem with our lint though, i think it will complain

2015-10-08T13:45:58 <gtirloni> exactly!
2015-10-08T13:46:19 <gtirloni> i thought something was wrong with the servers, maybe sessions aren\'t being saved, what\'s happening omg?! :( but i discovered it\'s much much worse: food that i\'m unable to access!
2015-10-08T13:46:39 <Bosmon> FOOD?
2015-10-08T13:48:41 <gtirloni> yep, in the form of cookies nonetheless
2015-10-08T13:49:19 <Justin_o> the good thing about real cookies is that they don\'t help advertisers track you
2015-10-08T13:49:24 <Justin_o> well, that\'s only one of the good things

2015-10-08T13:50:57 <Bosmon> COuld you paste your questions here?
2015-10-08T13:51:16 <Justin_o> Bosmon: sure, it\'s pretty simple i think
2015-10-08T13:51:23 * colinclark joined the channel
2015-10-08T13:51:35 <Justin_o> Bosmon: this is the output from the toISOString method on an instance of a date object "2015-10-07T13:43:12.000Z"
2015-10-08T13:51:54 <Justin_o> which is similar to yours. So i could just replace the "-:." with ""
2015-10-08T13:52:01 <Justin_o> but it would have the 000 time zone still
2015-10-08T13:52:03 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, it is inappropriate
2015-10-08T13:52:10 <Bosmon> This is why I suggested simply building the string yourself
2015-10-08T13:52:14 <Justin_o> or i could just build it up with the getMethods
2015-10-08T13:52:18 <Justin_o> okay thanks
2015-10-08T13:52:20 <Justin_o> that was all
2015-10-08T13:52:22 <Bosmon> The latter, yes
2015-10-08T13:52:23 <Bosmon> cheers
2015-10-08T13:52:40 <Justin_o> and yours is yyyymmddThhmmssZ right
2015-10-08T13:52:46 <Justin_o> Bosmon: ^
2015-10-08T13:52:56 <Bosmon> I believe this is what the ISO standard allows for, yes
2015-10-08T13:53:01 <Justin_o> cool thanks
2015-10-08T13:53:12 <Bosmon> YOu should make sure that what you produce is at least SOME profile of 8601....
2015-10-08T13:53:26 <jhung> gtirloni: these are self-destructing cookies, so it\'s all good.

2015-10-08T15:57:51 <alanharnum> well-known enough that this in the "pitfalls" of the official nginx documentation: https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/tutorials/config_pitfalls/
2015-10-08T15:58:18 <alanharnum> possibly not applicable re: Docker for those who are cool enough to run a Linux desktop & don\'t need to use docker-machine like avtar/gtirloni :(
2015-10-08T15:59:03 <avtar> and simonjb
2015-10-08T15:59:40 <alanharnum> now that simonjb has a linux desktop he forms a LINUX TRIANGLE with avtar & gtirloni
2015-10-08T15:59:54 <alanharnum> LINUX TRIANGLE is speculated as a necessary first step for the singularity

2015-10-08T16:36:59 <Bosmon> Hi Justin_o, gtirloni - so I had another go at the first-discovery-server vagrant startup
2015-10-08T16:37:12 <Bosmon> After I change the port, it gets a little further into the process
2015-10-08T16:37:27 <Bosmon> But I now get the following even more incomprehensible problem: https://gist.github.com/amb26/9822e891d8194dec63c1
2015-10-08T16:37:42 <Bosmon> My feeling is that it might be the overall easier approach to simply expect developers to have a working dev environment :)
2015-10-08T16:38:40 <Justin_o> Bosmon: is your virtualbox up-to-date?
2015-10-08T16:39:08 <Justin_o> it could also be that windows and mac may be at different versions, which would be unfortunate
2015-10-08T16:39:22 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I have no idea - what virtualbox?
2015-10-08T16:39:30 <Bosmon> Doesn\'t vagrant install everything it needs in its own installer?
2015-10-08T16:39:41 <Bosmon> I just installed it yesterday
2015-10-08T16:39:46 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i don\'t know, maybe.. i had already had virtualbox installed
2015-10-08T16:40:42 <Bosmon> Oh I see, there it is
2015-10-08T16:41:33 <Justin_o> i guess you might want to make sure the vagrant box is up-to-date but i suspect it is
2015-10-08T16:42:09 <Justin_o> you could run vagrant box update from my branch
2015-10-08T16:42:41 <Bosmon> It says it is up to date
2015-10-08T16:42:52 <Justin_o> avtar: ^ any thoughts
2015-10-08T16:44:12 * Bosmon2 joined the channel
2015-10-08T16:45:29 <gtirloni> first suggestion is to upgrade virtualbox to 5.0, vagrant doesn\'t install it so it\'s relying on what was already installed
