2015-04-15T16:12:39 <jhung> anastasiac: So it seems that the a11y sprint site is using a base line-height of 1.5. If you change that to 1, the text gets squished. So for our docs site, we should figure out how we set that base value of 1.5.
2015-04-15T16:13:14 <jhung> When I say "base line-height", I mean the base line height for UIO.
2015-04-15T16:13:29 <anastasiac> ah
2015-04-15T16:47:36 <jhung> simonjb, anastasiac: In the process of fixing the font issue in IE, I was thinking we may want to switch from using a local copy of Foundation + Normalize to using a CDN version. What are your thoughts?
2015-04-15T16:48:28 <jhung> Also I am going to fix the inline code block issue - in IE, code blocks can overlap text completely.

2015-04-15T17:26:25 <Justin_o> danaayotte: currently there is no indication for when the shift (modifier) key is active while we are simulating sticky keys.
2015-04-15T17:26:44 <Justin_o> for example on Mac OS X you get a visual and auditory indication for when it is enabled.
2015-04-15T17:30:47 <danaayotte> Justin_o are you suggesting we should show the shift symbol in the text field? not sure I\'m understanding you
2015-04-15T17:38:25 <Justin_o> danaayotte: something like that yes
2015-04-15T17:38:47 <Justin_o> so the user knows that it is active
2015-04-15T17:39:19 <Justin_o> danaayotte: if you try the sticky keys on mac you can see an example of this
2015-04-15T17:39:47 <danaayotte> got it Justin_o
2015-04-15T17:41:41 <Justin_o> danaayotte: what is your thought on how exactly the assessment should work? for example if the user types "2" is it a failure right away or do they have to repeatedly make mistakes?
2015-04-15T17:44:47 <danaayotte> it\'s a good question Justin_o. anastasiac: jessm: perhaps we can ask Shari for some advice on the call today. If we need the user to type more than one character, this should be explicit in the prompt (i.e. if we just say type "@" now they\'ll most likely just try once)
2015-04-15T17:46:52 <Justin_o> danaayotte: thanks, that\'s a good point.. could you let simonjb and I know
2015-04-15T17:47:32 <danaayotte> yes I will Justin_o
2015-04-15T17:47:42 <Justin_o> danaayotte: thanks
2015-04-15T17:48:09 <danaayotte> regarding the shift indication Justin_o, it should probably be a text indicator, since I think the up arrow convention will not be familiar to many users. and also this will work best with self-voicing. thinking now about what this might look like in the UI
2015-04-15T17:48:47 <Justin_o> danaayotte: yes, that makes sense thanks
2015-04-15T17:49:35 <anastasiac> Justin_o, simonjb, jhung, I\xe2\x80\x99ve issued a pull request for adding UIO to the docs site: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/pull/50
2015-04-15T17:49:39 <anastasiac> I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure who should review it

2015-04-15T17:54:41 <simonjb> anastasiac: that
2015-04-15T17:54:51 <simonjb> \'s awesome that you got UIO working!
2015-04-15T17:55:25 <anastasiac> yes, the site was well designed, so UIO just fit in nicely
2015-04-15T17:55:49 <anastasiac> I even got line spacing working, with jhung\xe2\x80\x99s and Justin_o\xe2\x80\x99s help
2015-04-15T17:58:39 <jhung> yay. anastasiac I can take a look once I have my pull request put in
2015-04-15T18:02:18 <anastasiac> jhung, it seems that Justin_o is looking at it now
2015-04-15T18:03:00 <jhung> thanks anastasiac. I have submitted a pull request for 404 page and other tweaks https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/pull/51
2015-04-15T18:04:38 <danaayotte> Justin_o I realised that the tooltip for the text field that reads "select to begin typing" is misleading - the user should be able to just begin typing as long as focus remains on the text field. so this tool tip would only appear if focus is not on the text field. does that make sense?

2015-04-15T19:18:24 <anastasiac> we should probably fix that
2015-04-15T19:18:36 <michelled> yes, we should fix it really soon
2015-04-15T19:18:48 <michelled> since I think we send integrators here a lot
2015-04-15T19:18:56 <anastasiac> michelled, if there\xe2\x80\x99s no JIRA, could you create one? It should be easy to fix this week

2015-04-15T10:50:21 <slim_jim> I just installed a dev setup on windows and login Sammy works perfectly.
2015-04-15T10:50:36 <slim_jim> however when I log him out the magnifier stays active.
2015-04-15T10:50:58 <slim_jim> I\'m on win 8.1 and I though taskkill workwd ok
2015-04-15T10:51:01 <slim_jim> any thoughts?
2015-04-15T10:51:09 <jhernandez> slim_jim: 32 or 64?
2015-04-15T10:51:25 <slim_jim> jhernandez: hey it\'s the windows support guy. :D
2015-04-15T10:51:47 <slim_jim> jhernandez: OS is 64, but I installed x86 node
2015-04-15T10:53:10 <jhernandez> oh, you said 8.1, so nevermind
2015-04-15T10:53:49 <slim_jim> jhernandez: yeah :(
2015-04-15T10:54:13 <jhernandez> I remembered the hotfix for 64bits but just realized that the problem is in win7 and with the high contrast theme
2015-04-15T10:54:24 <jhernandez> :(
2015-04-15T10:55:08 <slim_jim> jhernandez: ooh just got that maxbuff error when trying again  - i\'ll apply the fix you mentioned on list
2015-04-15T10:55:09 <jhernandez> so yeah, probably is a problem with taskkill
2015-04-15T10:55:15 <jhernandez> xD
2015-04-15T10:55:48 <slim_jim> jhernandez: notes say taskkill is issue on 7 - perhaps it means 7+ - will try
2015-04-15T10:57:34 <jhernandez> slim_jim: good luck!
2015-04-15T10:57:38 <jhernandez> :P
2015-04-15T10:57:50 <slim_jim> er, thanks.....
2015-04-15T10:57:53 <jhernandez> documentation says: "On Windows 7, the GPII cannot kill applications using taskill unless you change the user account control settings: ...."
2015-04-15T11:00:27 <slim_jim> jhernandez: yes that is what I will try.
2015-04-15T11:00:58 <slim_jim> re maxBuffer - I like it that the error say you should use the force (well --force)

2015-04-15T15:09:40 <kasparnet> ping
2015-04-15T15:09:56 <kasparnet> So I\'m midway through removing your normalize function
2015-04-15T15:10:13 <kasparnet> but suddenly got worried that it\'s gonna cause problems for us
2015-04-15T15:10:32 <kasparnet> looking at the testcases for this https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/295/files
2015-04-15T15:10:53 <kasparnet> do you remember whether we did the normalize only to ensure that the settings rechecking worked
2015-04-15T15:11:07 <kasparnet> or whether it was also because some SP3 app required it?
2015-04-15T15:14:08 * michelled has quit
2015-04-15T15:21:57 <jhernandez> kasparnet: *I think* that it was only to ensure that the settings re-check worked
2015-04-15T15:22:09 <kasparnet> ok cool
2015-04-15T15:22:56 <jhernandez> those changes were only motivated by the fact that the SP3 apps were having problems with the checker
2015-04-15T15:23:01 <kasparnet> If you dont mind, I\'ll do a pull request for you to just give a quick sanity check (ie. if I\'m missing anything obvious)
2015-04-15T15:23:15 <jhernandez> sure
2015-04-15T15:23:18 <kasparnet> cheers
2015-04-15T15:23:38 <jhernandez> and thanks
2015-04-15T15:23:39 <jhernandez> :)
