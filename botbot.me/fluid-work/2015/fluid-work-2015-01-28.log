2015-01-28T16:03:47 <Justin_o> Bosmon: hello, can you remind me the resolution order for a messagekey
2015-01-28T16:04:23 <Justin_o> is the look up order 1) messages 2) parent messages 3) strings block
2015-01-28T16:04:36 <Justin_o> or is it 1) strings 2) messages 3) parent messages ?
2015-01-28T16:10:57 <Bosmon> Hi Justin_o - I\'m not sure what you mean by "messages" and "parent messages"
2015-01-28T16:11:25 <Justin_o> maybe mesageResolver is a better tern
2015-01-28T16:11:26 <Justin_o> term
2015-01-28T16:11:45 <Bosmon> "strings" is only consulted if there is no resolver
2015-01-28T16:12:26 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay, that\'s what i thought, but I was trying to write a test for the new speak panel and it would render the values from the strings block if it was provided
2015-01-28T16:12:30 <Bosmon> But I think the relevant option is called "messageSource"
2015-01-28T16:12:37 <Justin_o> but from the messageResolver otherwise
2015-01-28T16:12:47 <Bosmon> Yes
2015-01-28T16:13:05 <Justin_o> sorry, not i\'m confused again
2015-01-28T16:13:12 <Bosmon> That is because the option that the renderer respects is called "messageSource", not "messageResolver"
2015-01-28T16:13:13 <Justin_o> it should take it from the strings first or last?
2015-01-28T16:13:39 <Justin_o> and maybe this is because we have the option set as parentBundle in the panel instead of messageSource
2015-01-28T16:14:30 <Justin_o> the option is set directly on the panel component in the options
2015-01-28T16:15:58 <Justin_o> Bosmon: ^
2015-01-28T16:16:56 <Bosmon> Justin_o - the code is here - https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/renderer/js/RendererUtilities.js#L200
2015-01-28T16:17:01 <Bosmon> As I recall, you wrote most of it :)
2015-01-28T16:20:31 <Justin_o> i don\'t remember that, but could have been me...
2015-01-28T16:26:27 <Justin_o> Bosmon: ah so it does use the strings first
2015-01-28T16:26:29 <Justin_o> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/renderer/js/RendererUtilities.js#L203-L205
2015-01-28T16:27:10 <Justin_o> so if we want to fall back onto the strings block instead of using it first we need to pass in a  different messageResolver
2015-01-28T16:27:27 <Justin_o> sorry, a different messageSource
2015-01-28T16:28:13 <Justin_o> I wonder if we\'ve implemented the prefsFramework wrong in this aspect?
2015-01-28T16:28:15 <Justin_o> Bosmon: ^
2015-01-28T16:29:09 <Bosmon> Justin_o - the automatic fabrication of the messageResolver was always just meant to be a fallback anyway
2015-01-28T16:29:28 <Bosmon> If you want to take detailed control of resolution as it sounds like you want to, you need to construct your own messageResolver and messageSource
2015-01-28T16:29:52 <Bosmon> But I think the standard requirement is for the more local bundle to take priority?
2015-01-28T16:30:32 <Bosmon> And for parent bundles to be used as fallbacks
2015-01-28T16:30:49 <Bosmon> Sorry, apologies for the ambiguous use of "fallback" : P
2015-01-28T16:31:11 <Bosmon> What is the situation that makes you want to use the local block as a fallback rather than taking priority?

2015-01-28T16:51:10 <anastasiac> michelled, colinclark: any thoughts on cindlyli1\xe2\x80\x99s question about namespacing the PGA first discovery tool stuff? Should we namespace things the same way as the pcp and pmt i.e. using a gpii namespace? or create its own namespace? The code is in its own repository right now
2015-01-28T16:51:15 <Justin_o> Bosmon: it\'s just that i was noticing that our panels don\'t specify a strings block
2015-01-28T16:51:27 * Sepideh joined the channel
2015-01-28T16:52:10 <Justin_o> so it might not be a big deal, but something that i was curious about... it\'s just that at the moment if you create a panel with a string block for default strings, you can\'t really localize it with our strategy

2015-01-28T16:57:23 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, it most likely is a big deal
2015-01-28T16:57:38 <Bosmon> I don\'t think it is something that has been properly thought through for the prefs framework
2015-01-28T16:58:22 <Bosmon> the "string block" was always just intended to be a convenience stopgap - and the "last point of overriding" for the integrator
2015-01-28T16:58:28 <Bosmon> It shouldn\'t be used by the framework itself

2015-01-28T17:49:42 <colinclark> Do you mean the Canadian government Web Experience Toolkit?
2015-01-28T17:50:10 <colinclark> This thing? https://github.com/wet-boew/wet-boew
2015-01-28T18:00:36 <slim_jim> colinclark: yes. It looks like something form the 80s :)
2015-01-28T18:00:42 <colinclark> lol
2015-01-28T18:01:00 <colinclark> I don\'t see any reason why it shouldn\'t ultimately be part of our list
2015-01-28T18:01:22 <slim_jim> OK, that\'s good enough
