2015-06-18T07:15:43 <the-t-in-rtf> @all, is there a way to extend an existing component and remove a particular gradeName?
2015-06-18T07:19:38 <the-t-in-rtf> I can see lots of examples of adding grades, but not of removing an existing one.
2015-06-18T07:21:50 <the-t-in-rtf> I want every feature of a grade except that I want to opt it out of some existing distributeOptions rules.
2015-06-18T07:25:58 <the-t-in-rtf> I suppose I\'ll need to add excludes to the parent grade doing the distributing.
2015-06-18T07:40:22 <the-t-in-rtf> Or create a wrapper grade that calls the method I need directly.

2015-06-18T13:55:56 <Justin_o> Bosmon: I\'m looking at FLUID-5675 https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5675. How close do you think the mock implementation should be to the real one. For example should the speech really be queued and execute asynchronously and be able to be cancelled. I think errors will have to be dropped though.

2015-06-18T14:31:10 <jhung> simonjb, Justin_o: I was going to start refactoring the infusion docs repo. The approach I was going to take was to mirror the infusion-docs repo into a new "docs-base" repo to maintain file history. Then gradually refactor these two repos as I work on the new ILDH site. Does this sound reasonable? Is there another approach to consider?
2015-06-18T14:32:58 <cindyli> Bosmon: my pull request for FLUID-5598, https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/587, is ready for another review, with an accompanying infusion-docs pull request: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/pull/67. Can you take a look when you have time?

2015-06-18T15:23:31 <Justin_o> jhung: i think that makes sense.. when you say mirror, you mean fork right?
2015-06-18T15:24:32 <simonjb> jhung, Justin_o: could we just start with an empty docs-base and move stuff over as needed? the history would still be in infusion-docs
2015-06-18T15:25:02 <Justin_o> simonjb: it might be harder to merge though
2015-06-18T15:25:28 <simonjb> Justin_o: merge?
2015-06-18T15:25:49 <jhung> Justin_o: hmmm I see that forking and mirroring are actually things in git. Both sound similar. Would forking me the preferred route?
2015-06-18T15:26:10 <Justin_o> simonjb: i guess it depends on how we are using these together.. i seem to have forgotten how we decided on that
2015-06-18T15:26:57 <simonjb> my memory is that infusion-docs would use npm to include docs-base
2015-06-18T15:27:24 <Justin_o> simonjb: ah right.. okay
2015-06-18T15:27:24 <simonjb> jhung, Justin_o ^
2015-06-18T15:27:34 <Justin_o> simonjb: so yes, you wouldn\'t need to merge them
2015-06-18T15:27:44 <jhung> ok simonjb, Justin_o
2015-06-18T15:28:04 <Justin_o> simonjb: hmm.. i guess either are okay, but if someone were to explicitly look for the history they might be confused
2015-06-18T15:28:07 <jhung> that makes it easier then. I would just create new empty repo for the "base" and copy files into there.
2015-06-18T15:28:13 <Justin_o> especially if this happens much later when we all forget
2015-06-18T15:29:03 <jhung> Justin_o: I\'d prefer to keep history if possible. But at this point I don\'t think there\'s a lot of history to preserve.
2015-06-18T15:29:03 <Justin_o> jhung: if you go that way, please include some reference somehow to the original location. maybe i document or something in the initial repo creation pointing to where it is coming from
2015-06-18T15:30:01 <simonjb> jhung, Justin_o: but we aren\'t losing history if we start with an empty docs-base, are we? the history is still in infusion-docs
2015-06-18T15:30:56 <jhung> good point. I guess as long as we document what is happening in the commit logs. I think it\'ll be okay to start docs-base from scratch.
2015-06-18T15:31:09 <Justin_o> simonjb: true, but it\'s not really an expectation that someone would have, to look in the repo that\'s using this one to find it\'s history.. so i think if we at least have a doc specifying that... i guess that\'d be okay

2015-06-18T15:54:45 <simonjb> our options: 1. start docs-base from empty, more stuff from infusion-docs as we refactor 2. start docs-base from infusion-docs and delete from each repo as we refactor
2015-06-18T15:55:01 <simonjb> s/more stuff/move stuff/
2015-06-18T15:55:20 * kasparnet joined the channel
2015-06-18T15:57:27 <simonjb> I was initially thinking 1, but I see the value in preserving the history that 2 gives us
2015-06-18T15:58:11 <jhung> 1. Is easier, but lacks history in docs-base. But history is in infusion-docs.
2015-06-18T15:58:28 <jhung> 2. Takes a bit more time and care, but preserves history in both repos.
2015-06-18T15:59:17 <simonjb> Would 2 be confusing in the intermediate steps where we have duplicated files? Option 1 seems clearer from that point of view
2015-06-18T15:59:31 * michelled joined the channel
2015-06-18T16:00:47 <simonjb> How would be accomplish #2? Check out infusion-docs, edit the remotes and then commit as a new project? Is there a less fiddly way?
2015-06-18T16:02:25 <jhung> simonjb: we could do this https://help.github.com/articles/duplicating-a-repository/

2015-06-18T16:04:30 <Justin_o> jhung: i\'m not sure we want a mirror though, since they will be different quite soon
2015-06-18T16:04:42 <jhung> true.
2015-06-18T16:05:04 <simonjb> jhung: I\'m not familiar with git mirrors -- whichever approach we take, we want to use infusion-docs as simply a starting point -- we don\'t want an on-going relationship
2015-06-18T16:06:23 <jhung> simonjb: I\'m afraid of that repository commit-ment, especially when it\'s push-y.

2015-06-18T16:06:57 <Justin_o> jhung, simonjb: i\'m thinking that we probably don\'t want to change infusion-docs until docs-base is ready.. meaning that jhung you should probably create the docs-base in your github space and modify work out of a branch in your infusion-docs repo.. when everything is ready, we push the change to infusion docs and move the docs-base to the fluid-project
2015-06-18T16:06:57 <Justin_o> github space
2015-06-18T16:07:01 <Justin_o> does that make sense?
2015-06-18T16:08:26 <colinclark> jhung: I liked your joke ;)
2015-06-18T16:08:44 <simonjb> oh yes, we definitely don\'t want to break fluid-project/infusion-docs while we are in the refactoring process
2015-06-18T16:09:17 <Justin_o> simonjb: and we would avoid the appearance of duplication by keeping the docs-base out of the fluid-project space till it\'s ready too
2015-06-18T16:09:20 <jhung> Justin_o: makes sense. I\'ll do that. We\'ll do the refactoring of infusion-docs in a separate pull once docs-base is done.
2015-06-18T16:09:52 <jhung> Justin_o, simonjb: Ok. This sounds like a plan. So to summarize...
2015-06-18T16:10:30 <jhung> 1. Start from a fork of infusion-docs in my user space to create docs-base to preserve file history.
2015-06-18T16:10:57 <simonjb> is 1. possible? doesn\'t forking keep the name and relationship?
2015-06-18T16:11:20 <jhung> 2. Submit both a new docs-base repo and a refactoring of infusion-docs at the same time.
2015-06-18T16:11:28 <simonjb> 2. agreed
2015-06-18T16:11:35 <Justin_o> simonjb, jhung: you\'ll probably have to do step 1 manually via the command line and not through the github interface
2015-06-18T16:11:40 * kasparnet has quit
2015-06-18T16:11:48 <simonjb> 1. scares me a little
2015-06-18T16:12:35 <jhung> It\'s worth trying though. Nothing will change in the master repos.
2015-06-18T16:12:44 <simonjb> I\'m worried you\'ll need to do some careful git surgery on the repo
2015-06-18T16:13:07 <Justin_o> simonjb, jhung: it should be as easy as adding an new github repo from an existing git repo
2015-06-18T16:13:07 <Justin_o> https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/
2015-06-18T16:13:30 <simonjb> Justin_o: but we\'ll need to be careful with the remotes
2015-06-18T16:14:02 <jhung> simonjb: I\'ll make sure the remotes point to the proper places.
2015-06-18T16:14:08 <simonjb> cool
2015-06-18T16:14:18 <simonjb> ok, sounds like a plan
2015-06-18T16:15:07 <jhung> excellent. I feel like I\'m scrubbing up for repository surgery. I\'m separating two repos from each other so they can both thrive.
2015-06-18T16:16:39 <simonjb> jhung :)
