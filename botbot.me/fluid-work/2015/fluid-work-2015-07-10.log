2015-07-10T17:47:30 <jhung> sure
2015-07-10T17:54:41 * cindyli joined the channel
2015-07-10T18:14:32 <simonjb> jhung: I have pushed the changes up to my forks of doc-base and doc-base-start
2015-07-10T18:15:55 * danayo joined the channel
2015-07-10T18:17:37 <jhung> thanks simonjb I will check it out and let you know how it goes
2015-07-10T18:18:05 <simonjb> jhung: what version of npm do you have?
2015-07-10T18:23:53 <jhung> 2.1.17 simonjb
2015-07-10T18:24:17 <simonjb> ok, cool, so you should be good with the file url in package.json
2015-07-10T18:28:53 * Jess_ joined the channel
2015-07-10T18:32:55 <jhung> simonjb: I tested it and everything looks as it did on your system.
2015-07-10T18:33:14 <simonjb> jhung: ok, that\'s great
2015-07-10T18:33:39 <jhung> thanks so much simonjb! I couldn\'t have done this without you.
2015-07-10T18:34:09 <simonjb> jhung: happy to help! is there more that I can help with at this point?
2015-07-10T18:39:09 <simonjb> I think going forward we could move more into doc-base (I\'m thinking maybe partials for the navigation structure) but this is a very good start
2015-07-10T18:42:52 <jhung> yes. The navigation definitely needs something more resilient. Currently it\'s rather brittle, but at least it works simonjb.
2015-07-10T18:43:07 <jhung> For now I think this is good. I\'ll let you know if there\'s anything else simonjb
2015-07-10T18:48:33 <simonjb> jhung: I have a small change I\'d like to make -- to move the helpers into their own namespace docBase.helpers
2015-07-10T18:48:44 <simonjb> I don\'t think that should impact you too much
2015-07-10T18:49:11 <simonjb> I\'ll let you know when I\'ve pushed the changes
2015-07-10T18:51:07 <simonjb> jhung: I also wonder if maybe we should rename the projects to fluid-doc-base and fluid-doc-base-start
2015-07-10T18:56:57 <jhung> simonjb: doc-base is intended to be general for idrc projects, not just fluid. I\'m worried by prefixing it with fluid- it would imply otherwise?
2015-07-10T18:59:49 <simonjb> jhung: yeah, that\'s reasonable -- ok, not a big thing right now but maybe let\'s think about the name -- my concern is that "doc-base" by itself as a node module name is very general
2015-07-10T19:04:21 <jhung> simonjb: I\'m wondering if we should rename the project now since it\'s the best time to do this. fluid-doc-base-* isn\'t so bad. Fluid would be the maintainers of the project anyway.
2015-07-10T19:10:26 <simonjb> jhung: fluid-docbase fluid-docsbase fluid-docs-base? we could bring it up at the floe meeting on monday at get people\'s thoughts?
2015-07-10T19:11:53 <jhung> sounds good simonjb

2015-07-10T19:24:43 <simonjb> jhung: I pushed my changes to doc-base and doc-base-start to add a "helpers" namespace
2015-07-10T19:26:18 <simonjb> jhung: we are heading out for a walk -- back in a little bit
2015-07-10T19:26:35 <jhung> thanks simonjb
