b'2015-08-18T16:20:02 <colinclark> ok
2015-08-18T16:20:08 <Bosmon> Which is what happens during the first part of the init sequence
2015-08-18T16:20:20 <Bosmon> We then unbind the fake jQuery from the global position, and insert the true jQuery there
2015-08-18T16:20:27 <Bosmon> So that, as you say, QUnit will run properly
2015-08-18T16:20:29 <colinclark> ok
2015-08-18T16:20:46 <colinclark> yet the tests themselves require a real jQuery
2015-08-18T16:21:03 <colinclark> Do they not?
2015-08-18T16:21:04 <colinclark> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/tests/framework-tests/core/js/FluidJSTests.js#L39
2015-08-18T16:21:31 <Bosmon> It appears that they do, yes
2015-08-18T16:22:08 <colinclark> and since they pass...
2015-08-18T16:22:35 <Bosmon> I guess the fluid.bind test can be moved out into FluidViewTests.js
2015-08-18T16:23:45 <colinclark> seems reasonable
2015-08-18T16:24:10 <colinclark> and the plain object tests, https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/tests/framework-tests/core/js/FluidJSTests.js#L34-L41
2015-08-18T16:24:16 <colinclark> Should the be conditional on the environment?
2015-08-18T16:24:51 <colinclark> i.e. omitting the tests for document and jDocument in a non-fully-jQuery environment
2015-08-18T16:30:10 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2015-08-18T16:30:19 <Bosmon> colinclark - seems reasonable
2015-08-18T16:30:37 <Bosmon> It\'s a bit "funny" that our hack of jQuery actually omits its constructor.....
2015-08-18T16:31:17 <colinclark> Hard to imagine usefully constructing a jQuery instance without a DOM

2015-08-18T17:20:42 <anastasiac> Bosmon, I\xe2\x80\x99m looking at your latest infusion-docs work, and there are some problems with the UIO integration. It works and all, but a) the button is about one pixel high; b) when the panel opens and the page slides down, the ToC doesn\xe2\x80\x99t also slide down
2015-08-18T17:21:17 <Bosmon> anastasiac - thanks for the report, anastasiac
2015-08-18T17:21:23 <anastasiac> Also: I like the separate scrolling for the ToC and the content, but on pages that are very short, the footer is floating  up in the middle of the page
2015-08-18T17:21:31 <Bosmon> I\'ll rework my "expert CSS" a little more
2015-08-18T17:21:35 <anastasiac> Bosmon: should I add these comments to the pull request?
2015-08-18T17:21:43 <Bosmon> anastasiac - sure
2015-08-18T17:23:04 <colinclark> Bosmon: So in my future TOMATO TIME, I\'ll split the dedupe-infusion code out of the grunt task into its own tiny module, and then we can write postinstall scripts that run it without the added overhead of requiring huge chunks of Grunt as npm dependencies instead of devDependencies
2015-08-18T17:23:12 <colinclark> is that roughly what we discussed off-channel?
2015-08-18T17:25:56 <anastasiac> jhung, the styling work you\xe2\x80\x99re doing for the ILDH: Is any of it stuff that could go into the docs-base or docs-template repos, and if so are you doing that?
2015-08-18T17:26:47 <Bosmon> colinclark - awesome

2015-08-18T17:27:30 <anastasiac> also, jhung: In his FLUID-5249 docs branch, Bosmon is working on CSS to scroll the content and the ToC separately, which is kind of nice. When it\xe2\x80\x99s all working well, you might want to look at incorporating that into docs-template
2015-08-18T17:28:09 <jessm> fluid-everyone: a meeting conflict has come up\xe2\x80\xa6 the community workshop scheduled to be in the collab room tomorrow will need to meet in the lab or in the open space. without justin here, i thought i\xe2\x80\x99d just let everyone know
2015-08-18T17:29:20 <jhung> anastasiac: thanks! That\'ll be a good thing to integrate into the platform. We can address that when we start porting Infusion Docs.
2015-08-18T17:29:28 <jessm> simonjb: you\xe2\x80\x99re doing a workshop on lisp tomorrow?
2015-08-18T17:29:38 <simonjb> yeah, that\'s right jessm
2015-08-18T17:29:56 <anastasiac> jhung, the styling work you\xe2\x80\x99re doing for the ILDH: Is any of it stuff that could go into the docs-base or docs-template repos, and if so are you doing that?\\
2015-08-18T17:29:57 <jessm> simonjb: do you think it could work in either the lab or the open space?
2015-08-18T17:31:08 <jhung> anastasiac: most of the work I\'m doing is into doc-base and docs-template first, then integrated into the ILDH.

2015-08-18T18:16:42 <simonjb> with your internet connection
2015-08-18T18:16:57 <kasparnet> yeah - though I was hoping to do some cooking instead of meeting now :)
2015-08-18T18:17:22 <simonjb> kasparnet: yeah, that\'s fine, we can just discuss at the arch meeting tomorrow
2015-08-18T18:17:45 <kasparnet> ok cool - else any time w/o official meetings tomorrow is fine as well
2015-08-18T18:22:31 <simonjb> colinclark, Bosmon: I was planning on doing the Lisp community meeting tomorrow but we have a space clash here and that together with Justin and Avtar being away makes me think it might be better to postpone for a week (though I think Kaye was maybe going to come tomorrow) -- do either of you have thoughts on postponing it?
2015-08-18T18:22:56 <colinclark> simonjb: I\'m happy to go with whatever choice you think makes the most sense
2015-08-18T18:23:00 <colinclark> it would be great to have Avtar and Justin there
2015-08-18T18:23:08 <colinclark> we can always send Kaye a note and tell her about the schedule change
2015-08-18T18:23:17 <colinclark> or if you\'d rather go ahead, I\'m cool with that, too
2015-08-18T18:27:39 <Bosmon> simonjb - I know I can make tomorrow 100%, but I might not be able to make the spot next week
2015-08-18T18:28:07 <Bosmon> We were due to take my mother for a trip, and it just depends which day is fine
2015-08-18T18:28:35 <simonjb> ok, thanks colinclark and Bosmon
2015-08-18T18:43:37 <gtirloni> fluid-everyone: i\'m planning to take fluid\'s wiki down tonight for an upgrade and server migration between 7-10PM EST / 0-3am CET. would that be okay?
2015-08-18T18:44:08 <colinclark> I\'m okay with, gtirloni

2015-08-18T13:22:06 <Bosmon> KASPARD DE LA .... *NITT*!
2015-08-18T13:22:10 * Bosmon retires to a safe distance
2015-08-18T13:22:28 <Bosmon> Let\'s see if you will respond to me today :)
2015-08-18T13:22:34 <kasparnet> Bosmon: TADA!!!!
2015-08-18T13:22:44 <kasparnet> not even 1 minute
2015-08-18T13:22:45 <Bosmon> Fluke
2015-08-18T13:22:48 <Bosmon> Bet you won\'t do it again
2015-08-18T13:22:50 <kasparnet> have you ever seen anything like it?
2015-08-18T13:22:55 <kasparnet> POW!!!
2015-08-18T13:22:59 <kasparnet> it\'s amazing!
2015-08-18T13:23:16 <alanharn_> i impressed myself by recognizing Bosmon\'s reference
2015-08-18T13:23:43 <kasparnet> .. now I\'ve filled my quick response quote for the year though
2015-08-18T13:24:49 <kasparnet> so, Bosmon, I tried out \'the thing\' we talked about at wednesdays architecture meeting (http://piratepad.net/c4a-arch-12-08-2015)
2015-08-18T13:25:19 <Bosmon> Oh yes
2015-08-18T13:25:20 <Bosmon> That
2015-08-18T13:25:25 <kasparnet> just to recap - this is me attempting to catch error messages on login, so I can pass them on to the PCP
2015-08-18T13:25:32 <Bosmon> yes
2015-08-18T13:25:36 <kasparnet> anyway - I\'m not being very successful still
2015-08-18T13:26:04 <kasparnet> so - for starters I just threw this directly into UserLogin.js (under flowmanager)
2015-08-18T13:26:07 <kasparnet> "{request}.events.onError": "{that}.myfun",
2015-08-18T13:26:30 <kasparnet> under listeners
2015-08-18T13:27:10 * jessm joined the channel
2015-08-18T13:27:12 <kasparnet> but if I fail one of the requestProxies by calling the onError event, myfun never gets called
2015-08-18T13:29:53 * anastasiac joined the channel
2015-08-18T13:30:01 <Bosmon> Ok, looks like this is screwed in "old Kettle"
2015-08-18T13:30:11 <Bosmon> Try replacing the context with {requestProxy} instead
2015-08-18T13:31:16 <Bosmon> Well, wait
2015-08-18T13:31:18 <Bosmon> Don\'t do that.....
2015-08-18T13:33:57 <Bosmon> Carry on with what you\'re doing
2015-08-18T13:34:00 <Bosmon> Just stop using the requestProxy
2015-08-18T13:34:09 <Bosmon> We need to stop using it anyway, since it\'s gone completely in NEW KETTLE
2015-08-18T13:34:12 <Bosmon> So this will be good practice
2015-08-18T13:41:21 <kasparnet> Bosmon: so - I shouldn continue listening to the onError event of {request} but shouldn\'t fail the requestProxy?
2015-08-18T13:41:37 <kasparnet> I guess I could try throwing a fluid.fail() instead
2015-08-18T13:41:38 <Bosmon> kasparnet - right
2015-08-18T13:41:40 <Bosmon> no
2015-08-18T13:41:48 <Bosmon> Just fire the onError event on the {request} directly
2015-08-18T13:42:33 * sepideh joined the channel
2015-08-18T13:48:40 * alanharn_ is now known as alanharnum_
2015-08-18T13:50:29 <kasparnet> Bosmon: so much weirdness going on... So calling {request}.events.onError directly, I get the proper return to the HTTP login call, but my {requests}.events.onError listener never gets called... Either it\'s because it somehow manages to get destroyed before hand, or cause I\'m doing something really stupid (which is probably the case)
2015-08-18T13:50:36 <kasparnet> so I\'ll triage a bit more
2015-08-18T13:51:02 <Bosmon> Should be {request}.event.onError the 2nd time, rather than {requests}
2015-08-18T13:51:04 <Bosmon> Hopefully just a typo
2015-08-18T13:51:29 <kasparnet> yup, just a typo :S
2015-08-18T13:51:35 <kasparnet> here in the chat that is
2015-08-18T13:51:43 <kasparnet> ... but in either case, I think this requires a *lot* of modifications throughout the code, as we generally seem to be calling the request proxy
2015-08-18T13:52:08 <Bosmon> Yes well.... they have to happen, either now or later : P
2015-08-18T13:52:17 <kasparnet> yeah
2015-08-18T13:52:22 <Bosmon> But it\'ll be enough for now just to catch the ones that might affect the request you\'re interested in
2015-08-18T13:53:10 <Bosmon> Try adding priority: "first" on the error listener you are adding
2015-08-18T13:53:19 <Bosmon> You\'re probably right about it being notified after the request is destroyed
2015-08-18T13:53:23 <kasparnet> I\'m generally just interested in anything failing :) And it\'s quite hard to catch anything since both the prefs server and device reporter apparently fail silently at the moment
2015-08-18T13:53:44 <kasparnet> I dont think I\'ve seen priorities for listeners
2015-08-18T13:53:53 <kasparnet> before

2015-08-18T13:59:49 <kasparnet> cool - thanks for the links, Bosmon
2015-08-18T14:00:38 <kasparnet> simonjb, Bosmon: I\'m actually due for a meeting with Gregg and Manuel now
2015-08-18T14:00:46 <kasparnet> which is set to last for 1 hour
2015-08-18T14:01:57 <kasparnet> I could probably do 30 minutes at 17:00
2015-08-18T14:02:33 <simonjb> that would be great. I\'m thinking that we shouldn\'t have to meet for too long
2015-08-18T14:02:57 <Bosmon> Ok, that\'s fine
2015-08-18T14:03:01 <Bosmon> I guess that was 17:00 CET
2015-08-18T14:03:26 <kasparnet> yup
2015-08-18T14:03:29 <kasparnet> 1 hr from now
2015-08-18T14:10:13 <kasparnet> Bosmon: Yay -- adding the "first" priority actually made it work!
2015-08-18T14:10:21 <Bosmon> awesome

2015-08-18T15:49:45 <cindyli> anastasiac: what was ur concern about the API docs?
2015-08-18T15:50:26 <anastasiac> cindyli: all of the fd tool api pages have a section of links labelled \xe2\x80\x9csee also\xe2\x80\x9d, right?
2015-08-18T15:51:18 <cindyli> right
2015-08-18T15:51:25 <cindyli> i see
2015-08-18T15:51:30 <anastasiac> cindyli: some of those links are linking to the old wiki docs
2015-08-18T15:51:35 <anastasiac> instead of the new docs site
2015-08-18T15:51:49 <cindyli> makes sense, anastasiac. will change that. thanks
2015-08-18T15:51:55 <anastasiac> thanks

2015-08-18T16:18:20 <colinclark> Bosmon: I am so easily confused :)
2015-08-18T16:18:36 <colinclark> Am I correct in reading these tests as not actually doing what they seem to claim to do?
2015-08-18T16:18:38 <colinclark> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/tests/framework-tests/core/html/FluidJSStandalone-test.html#L20
2015-08-18T16:19:04 <colinclark> In that they aren\'t running the FluidJSTests with only the standalone version of jQuery
2015-08-18T16:19:33 <colinclark> since of course QUnit won\'t function without a full jQuery
2015-08-18T16:19:39 <Bosmon> colinclark - they are
2015-08-18T16:19:49 <Bosmon> That is, you are not correct in reading them that way : P
2015-08-18T16:19:57 <Bosmon> What they test is the behaviour of Fluid.js when bound against the standalone jQuery
2015-08-18T16:20:01 <colinclark> ah ah
