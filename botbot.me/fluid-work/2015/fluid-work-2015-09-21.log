b"2015-09-21T10:21:15 <the-t-in-rtf> I switch between versions regularly when testing, especially on Windows.
2015-09-21T10:21:24 <the-t-in-rtf> I have used 0.8, 0.10, and 0.12 before
2015-09-21T10:21:38 <slim_> hmmm. why that
2015-09-21T10:21:39 <the-t-in-rtf> They all worked with my code and the bits of infusion/kettle/jqUnit I use.
2015-09-21T10:21:58 <the-t-in-rtf> Mostly I have what was available when I installed.
2015-09-21T10:22:10 <the-t-in-rtf> I install other things when people are reporting problems from other environments.
2015-09-21T10:22:40 <slim_> AHA. I'll go for latest pre 0.4.x.0 which I assume is not supported yet.
2015-09-21T10:22:50 <the-t-in-rtf> You mean npm?
2015-09-21T10:23:16 <slim_> annoying all the NVMs i try don;t work with 0.4.x which I now use
2015-09-21T10:23:36 <slim_> no sorry node 4.x.0 - semver
2015-09-21T10:24:11 <slim_> ie the new version which merges io.js and adds some eS6 stuff
2015-09-21T10:24:12 <the-t-in-rtf> woo, I have not tried anything in the new post io.js world.
2015-09-21T10:24:36 <slim_> well it  - seems fast
2015-09-21T10:25:02 <slim_> great thanks for your help
2015-09-21T10:25:51 <the-t-in-rtf> What's your node version manager?  I use this, but it's not good:  https://github.com/hakobera/nvmw
2015-09-21T10:27:24 <slim_> yes tried that but fails with 4. TOuble is the node version api has changed and so has registry use
2015-09-21T10:27:26 <slim_> nvm-windows is actually nicer as only uses a symbolic link so can manually switch by changing it's target (ie mklink)
2015-09-21T10:27:43 <the-t-in-rtf> Ah, this? https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows

I have a couple of questions. 1) could you explain a bit about how the authentication codes are created and used. 2) what is the external api we need to support couchdb to oauth2 server? I'm trying to narrow down the list of views.

2015-09-21T10:12:09 <slim_> It must be there but can't find.
2015-09-21T10:12:16 <slim_> oh this is GPII-WIndows only for now
2015-09-21T10:13:55 <the-t-in-rtf> I have submitted poor enough stuff over time that I hope I can safely comment on that based on the feedback I've received.
2015-09-21T10:14:05 <slim_> I see grunt is main build tool so now looking at gruntfile
2015-09-21T10:14:28 <the-t-in-rtf> grunt jshint and grunt jsonlint should cover what you need.
2015-09-21T10:14:40 <the-t-in-rtf> Assuming this is an existing project with a proper gruntfile and jshintrc.
2015-09-21T10:15:35 <slim_> yes grunfile has those tragets.
2015-09-21T10:15:37 <the-t-in-rtf> If you are using an IDE to check your work, note that you must use JSHint 2.4.0, anything newer does not enforce formaatting.
2015-09-21T10:15:54 <the-t-in-rtf> formatting, even.
2015-09-21T10:16:07 <slim_> gonna try new VisualStudio node support
2015-09-21T10:16:25 <slim_> I'm sure your quality is awesome :)
2015-09-21T10:16:30 <slim_> so not unittest required?
2015-09-21T10:16:36 <the-t-in-rtf> Oh, they definitely are.
2015-09-21T10:16:44 <the-t-in-rtf> for things where unit tests make sense.
2015-09-21T10:17:04 <the-t-in-rtf> There are other things where client tests are needed, and still others where integration tests are best.
2015-09-21T10:17:15 <slim_> this is binding for winsetres so does - though has side effects
2015-09-21T10:17:35 <slim_> like completely borking your screen :)
2015-09-21T10:17:39 <the-t-in-rtf> I have written all three using jqUnit and can hopefully dig up non-confusing examples
2015-09-21T10:18:05 <the-t-in-rtf> Some of the higher-order constructs in our tests are nutty.  Build a thing to run a thing to build a thing to run the test.
2015-09-21T10:18:11 <slim_> great. Can you point me to where to add them and how to run? Again Windows repo only
2015-09-21T10:18:22 <the-t-in-rtf> Depends on what's there.
2015-09-21T10:18:34 <slim_> ug - mocking mania
2015-09-21T10:18:51 <the-t-in-rtf> By that I mean that if they are using some kind of harness already, use that.
2015-09-21T10:18:53 <slim_> that's a politician's answer :)
2015-09-21T10:19:12 <slim_> OK I'll rummage. There is a test folder
2015-09-21T10:19:25 <the-t-in-rtf> My rule of thumb is if you're only testing a static function and there are no requests involved, you can use jqUnit programatically.
2015-09-21T10:19:43 <the-t-in-rtf> If there are requests involved, you're better off making a testCaseHolder and testEnvironment.
2015-09-21T10:19:56 <slim_> oooh - OK thanks
2015-09-21T10:20:03 <slim_> oh, one more q
2015-09-21T10:20:05 <the-t-in-rtf> On the client side, I do things very differently than anyone else.
2015-09-21T10:20:21 <the-t-in-rtf> you should not ask me to guide you there unless your pants are good for deep bramble thickets.
2015-09-21T10:20:27 <the-t-in-rtf> sure
2015-09-21T10:20:41 <slim_> heh
2015-09-21T10:20:43 <slim_> I've asked before but forgotten - which version of node / npm should I have?
2015-09-21T10:20:52 <slim_> actually just node
