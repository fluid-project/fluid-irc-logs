2015-12-11T17:09:14 <clown> jhernandez: have you rid the nan code of the Isolate?  Is it possible? Have you pushed?
2015-12-11T17:13:48 <jhernandez> clown: half of it, I\'ve been busy with another thing
2015-12-11T17:14:27 <clown> jhernandez, okay.  I\'ve pushed one change to nodepackagekit.cc to address another of Bosmon\'s comments.
2015-12-11T17:14:28 <jhernandez> and I don\'t think I will make it today - need to leave earlier today
2015-12-11T17:14:40 <jhernandez> awesome!
2015-12-11T17:14:45 <clown> but, you can get rid of the Isolate?
2015-12-11T17:15:23 <clown> jhernandez ^
2015-12-11T17:15:36 <jhernandez> partially, need to keep working on it
2015-12-11T17:15:59 <clown> so, we\'ll have a partial Isolate...
2015-12-11T17:16:01 <clown> :-)
2015-12-11T17:16:03 <jhernandez> heh
2015-12-11T17:16:51 <clown> okay.  I\'ll take a stab at the Isolates in nodepackagekit.cc this afternoon \xe2\x80\x94 it\'s lunch time here now.  I\'ll see how far I get.
2015-12-11T17:17:08 <jhernandez> cool
2015-12-11T17:17:41 <jhernandez> sorry for not having any decent portion of code to push for your inspiration
2015-12-11T17:19:22 * alanharnum has quit
2015-12-11T17:19:38 <jhernandez> but as I commented on the pr, "Nan:New<String>("My String").ToLocalChecked()" can be a good way for us to get rid of Isolate
2015-12-11T17:19:51 <clown> jhernandez: no problem.  Maybe this way I\'ll learn something.
2015-12-11T17:20:05 <clown> gotta run; the gang is leaving for lunch now.
2015-12-11T17:20:15 <clown> thanks jhernandez.  Have a nice weekend!
2015-12-11T17:20:34 <jhernandez> clown: you too!!

2015-12-11T19:47:06 <bens_> hi alanharnum, avtar gtirloni. happy friday. Any pointers on where to see how the Access-Control-Allow-(Origin|Methods|Headers|Credentials) headers are set on http responses to http://preferences.gpii.net/preferences? I\'ve been tracing through the docker-preferences-server and gpii/universal repositories and am having a hard time finding anything. I was thinking it would be configured onto kettle from the configs at gpii/universal/gpii/config or
2015-12-11T19:47:06 <bens_> via code somewhere in the gpii/universal but i\'m not finding anything in my searches
2015-12-11T19:49:07 <anastasiac> bens_: folks seem to be on a call right now, so they might be a bit delayed in responding to your questions
2015-12-11T19:49:39 <bens_> ah, thanks for the heads up
2015-12-11T19:50:48 <gtirloni> hey bens_ , i don\'t think we\'re using CORS in our deployments. could this be a bluemix setting?
2015-12-11T19:53:35 <bens_> gtirloni, could be. I think the default behavior is to not set these headers though so I was trying to find how they\'re set. I could see it being a bluemix setting though
2015-12-11T19:54:56 <gtirloni> yeah, because right now we use nginx/haproxy as the frontend to the gpii components and i don\'t see any CORS-related settings on them
2015-12-11T19:55:34 <bens_> gtirloni, is there a possibility that because i\'ve built an image from gpii-ops/docker-preferences-server today that as I built up the image i\'ve pulled a different version of gpii/universal code?
2015-12-11T19:56:04 <bens_> .. different than whats running at preferences.gpii.net i mean
2015-12-11T19:59:13 <gtirloni> docker-preferences-server is using kaspermarkus/universal docker image.. which i can see got built successfully for the last time 15 days ago.
2015-12-11T20:03:04 <gtirloni> try to check fluid-project/kettle (lib/middleware.js) .. although I\'m not the best person to speak about that but it looks like it sets some headers
2015-12-11T20:09:07 <bens_> ah thank you.. i\'m going to poke it with curl a bit too.. when in doubt.. curl
2015-12-11T20:09:41 <alanharnum> bens_: i\'m not in a good position to answer a question about the headers i\'m afraid :(
2015-12-11T20:09:56 <alanharnum> but curl can solve many of these questions i\'m sure
2015-12-11T20:14:41 * lliskovoi joined the channel
2015-12-11T20:31:08 <gtirloni> bens_: maybe something changed
2015-12-11T20:31:14 <gtirloni> curl -D - http://preferences.gpii.net/rawPreferences/carla   <-- old code
2015-12-11T20:31:26 <gtirloni> curl -D - http://gpii-a-nginx-1.inclusivedesign.ca/preferencess/carl   <1-- newer

2015-12-11T20:34:43 * michelled joined the channel
2015-12-11T20:37:36 <bens_> i\'m farily certain its an issue within the container on bluemix.. can\'t get anything out of it even via curl
2015-12-11T20:38:21 <bens_> it just happens to look like a CORS issue from a browser
2015-12-11T20:47:56 <alanharnum> bens_: that sounds to me like it could be an issue with networking to the container - i don\'t know Bluemix but is the container exposing the correct ports?
2015-12-11T20:48:27 * michelled has quit
2015-12-11T20:50:00 <alanharnum> it\'s also possible (poking around https://developer.ibm.com/bluemix/2014/12/04/ibm-containers-beta-docker/, which is probably outdated info at this point) that there\'s some special config that will need to happen to make use of the networking features
2015-12-11T20:50:09 <alanharnum> (this is probably all stuff you\'ve already checked)
2015-12-11T20:50:20 * lliskovoi joined the channel
2015-12-11T20:51:17 <alanharnum> the "real IP addresses on containers" sounds a little like how Kubernetes expects to operate. I didn\'t have to do anything particular special to run docker-preferences-server on Kubernetes, but that\'s from a "Kubernetes cluster running on my laptop" PoV.
2015-12-11T20:52:59 * lliskovoi joined the channel
2015-12-11T20:53:01 <bens_> i\'m currently looking at how my container is using port 8082 but i believe kettle is on 8081
2015-12-11T20:53:25 <bens_> is there a face palm emoticon?
2015-12-11T20:53:42 <alanharnum> bens_: the preferences server default for the container is 8082
2015-12-11T20:54:04 <alanharnum> this is https://github.com/gpii-ops/docker-preferences-server/ you\'re deploying, correct?
2015-12-11T20:54:22 * lliskovoi has quit
2015-12-11T20:54:44 * lliskovoi joined the channel
2015-12-11T20:54:45 <alanharnum> or more probably https://hub.docker.com/r/gpii/preferences-server/
2015-12-11T20:55:17 <bens_> yep
2015-12-11T20:55:37 <alanharnum> yeah the preferences server should be running on 8082 within the container if you\'re not reconfiguring anything
2015-12-11T20:58:54 * lliskovoi joined the channel
2015-12-11T21:12:42 <bens_> alanharnum, we\'re not setting NODE_ENV=perferencesServer.production
2015-12-11T21:12:58 <alanharnum> bens_: ah ok, yes, that would do it
2015-12-11T21:13:35 <bens_> unintentionally.. i\'m going to start over
2015-12-11T21:13:54 * alanharnum assumed you were running using the standard config
2015-12-11T21:14:11 * simonjb joined the channel
2015-12-11T21:14:20 <bens_> me too
2015-12-11T21:14:20 <alanharnum> but yeah, with the way that container is currently, you need to specify the universal config to use to run it in standalone preferences server mode
2015-12-11T21:19:02 <bens_> thanks for the help alanharnum
2015-12-11T21:20:05 <alanharnum> no problem bens_ - it is helpful hearing the issues you\'re encountering to inform my own container refactoring
