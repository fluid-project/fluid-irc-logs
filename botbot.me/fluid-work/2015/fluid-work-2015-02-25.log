2015-02-25T21:33:27 <Justin_o> cindyli: do you think something like this would be safe to add to the panel grade https://github.com/fluid-project/first-discovery/blob/master/tests/js/panelsTests.js#L95-L100
2015-02-25T21:34:01 <Justin_o> instead of "{that}.options.testMessages" it would be "{that}.options.messageBase"
2015-02-25T21:34:24 <Justin_o> then you\'d just pass the fetched message down to that messageBase option
2015-02-25T21:36:44 <Justin_o> cindyli: or do you remember a reason why we didn\'t just pass these straight into the strings block?
2015-02-25T21:36:53 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: do you have a thought on that?
2015-02-25T21:38:34 <Bosmon7> "the fetched message"?
2015-02-25T21:38:40 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: yes
2015-02-25T21:38:50 <Bosmon7> Just one message?
2015-02-25T21:40:02 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: yes... for here I\'m trying to think of ways to pass the components specific message bundle to it.. not the merged one that we have right now
2015-02-25T21:40:58 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - I\'m confused whether you\'re talking about a message bundle or a single message
2015-02-25T21:44:06 <Justin_o> bundle
2015-02-25T21:44:16 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: or an object anyways
2015-02-25T21:44:23 * simonjb has quit
2015-02-25T21:44:28 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: so the fetch returns a object of objects
2015-02-25T21:44:40 <Justin_o> that it had pulled in from all of the various message json files
2015-02-25T21:45:51 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - it will be better for the component constructing the panel to just pass in a parentBundle that is already correct
2015-02-25T21:45:59 <Bosmon7> We don\'t want to merge the bundles together, we just want to connect them
2015-02-25T21:46:21 <Bosmon7> As we discovered in CSpace, the majority of the time spent constructing the component tree was spent on needlessly merging bundles together
2015-02-25T21:46:44 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: yes, we only get the correct strings to the component, or that is the goal anyways, but do i have to really create a message resolver for this.. since the component already has it\'s own
2015-02-25T21:47:19 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: the parentBundle i believe is itself a messageResolver
2015-02-25T21:47:37 <Justin_o> or i could be wrong, but i figure it would be quicker just to merge the fetched strings with a component\'s strings block
2015-02-25T21:49:26 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - it won\'t be quicker, and will create a lot of garbage
2015-02-25T21:49:53 <Bosmon7> As we discussed on Monday, it is quicker to set up a structure chaining together existing objects rather than explicitly merge them in a big bang
2015-02-25T21:50:10 <Justin_o> okay.. so would something like this be better https://github.com/fluid-project/first-discovery/blob/master/tests/js/panelsTests.js#L95-L100
2015-02-25T21:50:11 <Bosmon7> As well as occupying much less space in memory
2015-02-25T21:51:14 * kasparnet joined the channel
2015-02-25T21:51:17 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: or would it be better to rework this https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/preferences/js/PrefsEditor.js#L92-L101
2015-02-25T21:51:32 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - we should take the opportunity to correct this strategy
2015-02-25T21:51:39 <Bosmon7> Since "messaegeResolver" is a proper component now
2015-02-25T21:51:49 <Justin_o> and have it create many messageResolvers that we pass down directly, rather than what i had proposed to have them created in the panel
2015-02-25T21:51:56 <Bosmon7> We should move this into the components area of the panel rather than being a crazy "func in an expander" : p
2015-02-25T21:51:59 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: you mean use it a a subcomponent?
2015-02-25T21:52:02 <Bosmon7> Yes
2015-02-25T21:52:04 <Justin_o> :)
2015-02-25T21:52:04 * michelled joined the channel
2015-02-25T21:52:08 <Justin_o> i was thinking about that too
2015-02-25T21:53:36 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: okay.. cool.. so the fetch will still just be an object of objects of strings.. these will be properly sourced down into the messageBase options of the messageResolver subcomponent that is bound as the components own parentBundle?
2015-02-25T21:53:39 <Justin_o> does that make sense?
2015-02-25T21:53:57 <Justin_o> or i guess we could use it as the messageSource for a renderComponent
2015-02-25T21:54:03 <Justin_o> since all the panels are renderer components
2015-02-25T21:54:16 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: does that all sound correct?
2015-02-25T21:54:44 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - it\'s hard to tell : P
2015-02-25T21:54:44 <Bosmon7> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/renderer/js/RendererUtilities.js#L201
2015-02-25T21:54:48 <Bosmon7> As we know, this code is an awful mess
2015-02-25T21:55:30 <Bosmon7> We should take the opportunity to i) set up our own dedicated messageResolver subcomponent attached to our component, and ii) explicitly connect that to rendererOptions.messageSource so it doesn\'t try to construct its own one
2015-02-25T21:55:46 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: okay will do
2015-02-25T21:56:02 <Bosmon7> Other than that we should iii) never merge together messages objects by ourselves and always make use of the "parents" option of the messageResolver instead to do its own fallback
2015-02-25T21:56:26 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: i don\'t think i understand iii
2015-02-25T21:56:36 <Justin_o> at least the second half of it
2015-02-25T21:56:48 * michelled has quit
2015-02-25T21:56:57 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - the idea is that if a key is not found in one bundle, the search falls back to the parent bundle
2015-02-25T21:57:07 <Justin_o> it seems to be in the way this will be constructed that the strings block of a component will always be ignored
2015-02-25T21:57:07 <Bosmon7> I\'m not sure if we have any application-wide strings but I suspect that we will in the end
2015-02-25T21:57:13 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - yes, that\'s correct
2015-02-25T21:57:14 * michelled joined the channel
2015-02-25T21:57:27 <Bosmon7> it is time to start ignoring the strings block, it is an old-fashioned kind of "toy model" for message handling
2015-02-25T21:57:38 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: okay.. yah we probably don\'t have anything that are in the parent bundle anymore
2015-02-25T21:57:54 <Justin_o> at least not now
2015-02-25T21:58:06 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: so strings will eventually disappear ?
2015-02-25T21:58:10 <Bosmon7> We should make it clear that integrators should not expect to store anything in the "strings" block since it actively fights against properly and efficiently localising the application
2015-02-25T21:58:31 <Bosmon7> Well, it won\'t "disappear" as such, it\'s just at an inappropriate level of sophistication for the prefs framework
2015-02-25T21:58:31 * michelled has quit
2015-02-25T21:58:44 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: okay, will this be something that will happen to every component in the future, the need to supply a separate json message file
2015-02-25T21:58:45 <Justin_o> ?
2015-02-25T21:58:53 <Bosmon7> I imagine that people making small-scale "throwaway" kinds of components will find it convenient
2015-02-25T21:59:01 * michelled joined the channel
2015-02-25T21:59:22 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: okay... i guess i\'d like to be able to use the strings block as the final fall back
2015-02-25T21:59:29 <Justin_o> if a proper message bundle isn\'t found
2015-02-25T22:00:15 * michelled has quit
2015-02-25T22:00:41 * michelled joined the channel
2015-02-25T22:01:04 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - I guess you can write that into the end of the "parents" entry in the messageResolver\'s options
2015-02-25T22:01:12 <Bosmon7> So that it ends up being checked last
2015-02-25T22:01:35 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: so the parentBundle doesn\'t actually have to be a resolver it can be a plain object?
2015-02-25T22:01:48 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - it needs to be a resolver
2015-02-25T22:01:58 * michelled has quit
2015-02-25T22:02:02 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - as we decided, the RendererUtilities algorithm is incorrect since it checks the local strings first rather than last
2015-02-25T22:02:07 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: ah so i\'d have to construct a new one
2015-02-25T22:02:25 * michelled joined the channel
2015-02-25T22:02:30 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - but the parent should already have made a resolver in any case
2015-02-25T22:02:37 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: okay, so at this point is it better to ignore the strings block until and this will be sorted out in the new renderer?
2015-02-25T22:02:50 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - may as well ignore the strings block in the prefs framework, yes
2015-02-25T22:02:54 <Justin_o> i don\'t think i follow that part Bosmon7

2015-02-25T22:05:25 * michelled has quit
2015-02-25T22:05:44 <Bosmon7> I mean, for the purposes of defining panels in the prefs framework, the strings block should be ignored

2015-02-25T15:52:08 <Justin_o> cindyli: would we still need the prefsEditorType option for the case where prefsEditors are constructed with grades instead of an auxiliary schema?
2015-02-25T15:52:25 <Justin_o> or i guess they could just add the grades directly
2015-02-25T15:52:51 <cindyli> that\'s true. also i think prefsEditorType option is only used in builder
2015-02-25T15:54:13 <Justin_o> okay

2015-02-25T16:24:20 <cindyli> it looks ok, Justin_o, seems my FLUID-5552 pull won\'t affect the split of the message bundle

2015-02-25T18:00:25 <Bosmon7> Hi cindyli, Justin_o
2015-02-25T18:00:37 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: hello
2015-02-25T18:00:40 <Bosmon7> Here is the reference to the JAVER naming scheme for resource bundle fallback based on language
2015-02-25T18:00:42 <Bosmon7> http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/ResourceBundle.html#getBundle(java.lang.String,%20java.util.Locale,%20java.lang.ClassLoader)
2015-02-25T18:00:58 <cindyli> great. thanks, Bosmon7
2015-02-25T18:01:08 <Bosmon7> I think just implementing this as far as baseName_language_country would be good enough for now
2015-02-25T18:03:11 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: thanks, here\'s the jira for that work http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5599?src=confmacro#comment-25378
2015-02-25T18:03:20 <cindyli> Bosmon7: so the top component should add two more options for language and country?
2015-02-25T18:03:39 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: please feel free to modify that jira as needed

2015-02-25T20:11:57 <colinclark> Myles was very worried that someone would take the npm name "flocking"
2015-02-25T20:11:59 <colinclark> someone with boids
2015-02-25T20:12:05 <colinclark> but it looks like I still managed to get it

2015-02-25T20:56:40 <clown> Justin_o:  this may be useful to your PHeT group: https://www.w3.org/wiki/SVG_Accessibility
2015-02-25T20:56:51 <clown> Although, it is very early days.
2015-02-25T20:57:32 <Justin_o> clown: thanks, i\'ll take  look at that
2015-02-25T20:57:58 <clown> Justin_o:   I found it because I thought it was relevant to the group I\'m in.  I may still use it.
2015-02-25T20:58:14 <clown> note that the W3C servers seems to be slow today\xe2\x80\xa6
2015-02-25T20:58:33 <Justin_o> ah okay, that explains why it still hasn\'t open
2015-02-25T20:58:42 <Justin_o> i feel like it is ironic that they aren\'t working well though :)
2015-02-25T21:00:46 <Justin_o> clown: the section on sonification seems lacking
2015-02-25T21:01:16 <clown> Justin_o:  as I said, "it is very early days".
2015-02-25T21:01:22 <Justin_o> :)
2015-02-25T21:01:41 <clown> The graphcis a11y group at W3C just started like last Dec.
