b"2015-05-29T18:12:21 <anastasiac> michelled, Justin_o: FLOE-311 updated based on your review comments
2015-05-29T18:13:03 <Justin_o> anastasiac: thanks, I'll look again
2015-05-29T18:18:31 <Justin_o> michelled: i'm about to merge FLOE-311 for the spanish translations, did you see any other issues before it do that?
2015-05-29T18:18:51 <Justin_o> i didn't really pay attention to the French translation because it is incomplete
2015-05-29T18:21:13 <michelled> no, i didn't Justin_o
2015-05-29T18:22:41 <Justin_o> michelled: okay, i'll merge it now then
2015-05-29T18:23:11 <michelled> thx
2015-05-29T18:23:59 <michelled> Justin_o: who worked on the styling for the nav bar scrolling?
2015-05-29T18:24:37 <Justin_o> michelled: not sure, Bosmon? jhung also made some fixes to it
2015-05-29T18:25:40 <jhung> michelled: I did some styling fixes it to it recently. What's up?
2015-05-29T18:26:46 <michelled> if I decrease the size of the tool in step 6, the navigation icons get cut off when I got to step 7
2015-05-29T18:26:52 <michelled> is that known jhung?
2015-05-29T18:29:36 <michelled> oh, the slow voices are so funny :)
2015-05-29T18:29:48 <Justin_o> michelled: they really are haha
2015-05-29T18:29:58 <Justin_o> michelled, anastasiac: I merged in the spanish translations
2015-05-29T18:30:04 <michelled> thx Justin_o
2015-05-29T18:30:12 <michelled> simonjb: that means french should no longer be broken
2015-05-29T18:30:13 <anastasiac> yay!
2015-05-29T18:30:23 <jhung> michelled: let me see...
2015-05-29T18:30:41 <simonjb> awesome!
2015-05-29T18:30:42 <Justin_o> michelled, anastasiac: i'm heading offline now.. have a good weekend
2015-05-29T18:30:47 <anastasiac> thanks, Justin_o
2015-05-29T18:31:59 <michelled> you too Justin_o!
2015-05-29T18:33:10 <jhung> michelled: I think I know what's happening. It has to do with the way the navbar is structured and the fixed widths being used. I would like to fix this, but it isn't quick. How crtitical is it you think?
2015-05-29T18:33:53 <michelled> probably not super critical jhung
2015-05-29T18:34:05 <michelled> I can open a JIRA and put it on the bug list
2015-05-29T18:34:34 <jhung> ok. It can actually be fixed together with FLOE-359.
2015-05-29T18:34:35 <michelled> anastasiac: is it intentional that we can't turn the voice off on the congratulations page?
2015-05-29T18:34:37 <jhung> ^ michelled
2015-05-29T18:34:50 <michelled> ah great  jhung - I'll just add a note
2015-05-29T18:34:54 <jhung> ok
2015-05-29T18:36:58 <anastasiac> michelled: good question. That\xe2\x80\x99s not my doing, probably a dana question

2015-05-29T19:38:24 <jhung> ok thanks.
2015-05-29T19:42:07 <jhung> michelled, Justin_o, anastasiac - I added some hot new icons. Here's the pull request. https://github.com/fluid-project/first-discovery/pull/73
2015-05-29T19:44:22 <anastasiac> slick, jhung!

2015-05-29T19:46:40 <anastasiac> :-)
2015-05-29T19:47:22 <jhung> Thanks for catching that. They're all starting to look the same to me. lol

2015-05-29T16:48:32 <michelled> ok, so the language screen is super cool :)
2015-05-29T16:48:41 <michelled> I\'m loving hearing the different voices
2015-05-29T16:48:44 <michelled> and languages
2015-05-29T16:55:19 <michelled> \thi anastasiac
2015-05-29T16:55:34 <anastasiac> hi
2015-05-29T16:56:51 <anastasiac> michelled, if you love hearing the different voices, try my FLOE-311 branch; the Spanish translation is complete there, and the French is about half done.
2015-05-29T16:56:53 <michelled> I was playing with the language screen, and I realized that it will be confusing for a non-sighted user when they tab to the arrows
2015-05-29T16:57:05 <anastasiac> ah - how so, michelled?
2015-05-29T16:57:06 <michelled> have you noticed that as well?
2015-05-29T16:57:40 <anastasiac> I haven\xe2\x80\x99t played with it enough, but I have noticed in general that when only a tooltip is read aloud, it can be confusing for non-sighted users
2015-05-29T16:57:41 <michelled> well, when I tab to the arrow, it says "select to view more languages"
2015-05-29T16:57:49 <michelled> but when I select, it doesn\'t say anything more
2015-05-29T16:57:53 <anastasiac> ah, that\xe2\x80\x99s particularly confusing
2015-05-29T16:57:56 <michelled> which makes sense for a sighted user
2015-05-29T16:58:08 <anastasiac> I thought the arrows weren\xe2\x80\x99t supposed to be in the tab order
2015-05-29T16:58:16 <michelled> ah, maybe that\'s the issue :)
2015-05-29T16:59:16 <anastasiac> yeah, the thinking was that keyboard focus would just land on the list, and the user would just natigate that
2015-05-29T17:01:57 <michelled> actually, as I read the JIRA closer, it says "Pressing the arrow keys moves the focus to the language above or below (scrolling as necessary) but does not change the active language"
2015-05-29T17:02:01 <michelled> so maybe that\'s the issue
2015-05-29T17:04:11 <anastasiac> michelled, I\xe2\x80\x99m not quite able to check out simon\xe2\x80\x99s branch right now (in the middle of resolving conflicts on my branch).
2015-05-29T17:04:27 <anastasiac> could you try imagining the user experience without kbd focus on the arrows?
2015-05-29T17:04:34 <anastasiac> just tab past them and ignore the voice?
2015-05-29T17:04:44 <michelled> yes
2015-05-29T17:05:26 <michelled> anastasiac: yes, that would be fine too
2015-05-29T17:09:20 <anastasiac> cindyli, Justin_o, simonjb: I\xe2\x80\x99m looking at the keyboard template (keyboard.html) and I\xe2\x80\x99m noticing that the gpiic-fd-instructions class appears not less than four times.
2015-05-29T17:09:26 <anastasiac> this is a tad confusing...
2015-05-29T17:09:54 <anastasiac> given my understanding that the prototree binds the selector to \xe2\x80\x98instructions\xe2\x80\x99 string
2015-05-29T17:10:07 <anastasiac> can any of you clear this up for me?
2015-05-29T17:12:35 <michelled> anastasiac: do you know if the \'press n for next\' is supposed to work at this point?
2015-05-29T17:13:02 <anastasiac> michelled, I have never seen it work, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe we implemented it. cindyli or Justin_o should be able to confirm
2015-05-29T17:13:07 <anastasiac> press H should re-read the instructions
2015-05-29T17:13:43 <Justin_o> michelled: press n for next wasn\'t implemented
2015-05-29T17:14:02 <anastasiac> michelled, Justin_o, simonjb: Is the build site FD tool working for you? I\xe2\x80\x99m getting an error
2015-05-29T17:14:02 <michelled> we should remove that from the instructions I think
2015-05-29T17:14:11 <Justin_o> Bosmon: I\'ve added a comment to the FLOE-361 jira about the tooltips http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLOE-361#comment-25620
2015-05-29T17:14:17 <anastasiac> in chrome
2015-05-29T17:14:32 <Justin_o> michelled: i had asked dana about that before and she thought we should keep them. Maybe check with her on monday?
2015-05-29T17:14:57 <michelled> ok
2015-05-29T17:15:01 * sepideh joined the channel
2015-05-29T17:15:16 <michelled> anastasiac: it works for me
2015-05-29T17:15:26 <Justin_o> anastasiac: in regards to "gpiic-fd-instructions"
2015-05-29T17:15:34 <anastasiac> michelled, could you clear your cache and double-check?
2015-05-29T17:15:47 <Justin_o> that is the class that is used by the self voicing to know what to speak. It is not used by the panels for rendering
2015-05-29T17:16:08 <michelled> still working for me anastasiac
2015-05-29T17:16:38 <Justin_o> anastasiac: when does it break for you?
2015-05-29T17:17:10 <anastasiac> on the first screen, \xe2\x80\x9cUncaught TypeError: Cannot read property \'replace\' of undefined\xe2\x80\x9d and the mute button is empty
2015-05-29T17:17:17 <anastasiac> and the help button, empty
2015-05-29T17:17:42 <simonjb> anastasiac: do you have French selected?
2015-05-29T17:18:00 <simonjb> anastasiac: this sounds like the issue I showed you yesterday
2015-05-29T17:18:18 <michelled> simonjb: ah, so that issue with French is known
2015-05-29T17:18:30 <anastasiac> \x12ah, yes, simonjb \xe2\x80\x93\xc2\xa0I didn\xe2\x80\x99t even notice the selected language, you\xe2\x80\x99re right
2015-05-29T17:18:55 <anastasiac> michelled, I\xe2\x80\x99ll double-check if this issue is still present in my  language-fixed 311 branch, which I\xe2\x80\x99m keeping up to date with master
2015-05-29T17:20:04 <simonjb> anastasiac: it would be good to get this French issue fixed as soon as we can as it is distracting when testing the tool otherwise
2015-05-29T17:20:31 <simonjb> anastasiac: how far off is your branch from being ready? (if it fixes the issue)
2015-05-29T17:20:35 <michelled> simonjb: the only other thing I noticed while testing your branch was the confusing behaviour when using the keyboard with the arrow keys
2015-05-29T17:20:47 <michelled> simonjb: anastasiac mentioned that the plan was to take them out of tab order
2015-05-29T17:20:51 <anastasiac> simonjb: I\xe2\x80\x99m updating my branch right now with the rest of the french strings
2015-05-29T17:20:56 <michelled> is that something you will do in that branch?
2015-05-29T17:21:28 <simonjb> sorry michelled, can you elaborate?
2015-05-29T17:22:33 <michelled> when I tab to the arrow key it says "select to view more languages" but when I select it, nothing else is said
2015-05-29T17:22:54 <michelled> so either, we need to move the focus to the next langage, or take the arrows out of tab order
2015-05-29T17:23:03 <michelled> does that make sense simonjb?
2015-05-29T17:23:28 <simonjb> the next and prev buttons? the buttons with the arrows on them?
2015-05-29T17:23:42 <simonjb> triangles
2015-05-29T17:23:54 <michelled> yes, the triangle buttons
2015-05-29T17:24:13 <simonjb> ok, they did not used to be in the tab order but got put back in
2015-05-29T17:24:31 <simonjb> I\'m guessing by accident?
2015-05-29T17:24:50 <michelled> oh, interesting, let me check the build site
2015-05-29T17:25:15 <michelled> yes, the issue is in master
2015-05-29T17:25:16 <simonjb> https://github.com/fluid-project/first-discovery/commit/4bfb693c5321e2968c4780cce194c6484dcd6f45#diff-83cf0a5ae43a36ff920ad6d7f5142e24
2015-05-29T17:25:45 <michelled> I\'ll open a JIRA for it
2015-05-29T17:25:45 <simonjb> the tabindex="-1" was removed from lang.html
2015-05-29T17:25:53 <anastasiac> michelled, simonjb: regarding my translation branch, I misspoke. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t get the updated strings, I got a message saying I\xe2\x80\x99ll get them in a couple of days.
2015-05-29T17:26:02 <anastasiac> I can still test if the issue is still present, at least
2015-05-29T17:26:16 <michelled> I wonder if you want to get in what you\'ve got anastasiac
2015-05-29T17:26:24 <michelled> if it fixes the french issue we are experiencing
2015-05-29T17:26:34 <anastasiac> it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t :-(
2015-05-29T17:26:35 <simonjb> it would be great, I think, to fix the French breakage
2015-05-29T17:27:19 <anastasiac> michelled, simonjb: let me try ti fix the french breakage in my branch. I think it\xe2\x80\x99s related to string bundles
2015-05-29T17:27:28 <michelled> ok, thx anastasiac
2015-05-29T17:27:33 <anastasiac> if I can fix it, I\xe2\x80\x99ll issue the pull request with what I\xe2\x80\x99ve got, which is spanish and some french
2015-05-29T17:29:47 <anastasiac> oh, this is lovely, listening the chrome french woman read english
2015-05-29T17:30:03 <simonjb> michelled: I\'ll put the tabindex="-1" back on the triangle next/prev buttons in my branch -- as far as we know the removal of tabindex and adding back into the tab order was not intended? cindy isn\'t around today
2015-05-29T17:30:35 <anastasiac> michelled, simonjb: fixed; pull request coming soon
2015-05-29T17:31:31 <simonjb> Justin_o: when you reviewed and merged FLOE-358, was adding the language panel triangle buttons back into the tab order intentional or do we think by accident?
2015-05-29T17:31:37 <simonjb> awesome anastasiac
2015-05-29T17:32:00 <Justin_o> simonjb: i think that was a mistake
2015-05-29T17:32:14 <Justin_o> the design has been to keep them out of the tab order and only use those for the mouse
2015-05-29T17:32:22 <simonjb> ok, cool, thanks Justin_o
2015-05-29T17:32:38 <Justin_o> simonjb: thanks, will you put it back in with your branch?
2015-05-29T17:32:48 <simonjb> yes Justin_o, I will
2015-05-29T17:33:21 <michelled> thx simonjb
2015-05-29T17:33:31 <michelled> I made a JIRA for it, we\'ll just close it when your branch goes in
2015-05-29T17:33:57 <simonjb> michelled: I\'ll make that change now, what is the number?
2015-05-29T17:35:01 <michelled> http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLOE-364
2015-05-29T17:36:57 <anastasiac> simonjb, michelled, Justin_o: Spanish translation pull request: https://github.com/fluid-project/first-discovery/pull/72  Who will review?
2015-05-29T17:43:46 <simonjb> michelled: I pushed my fix for FLOE-364 to my FLOE-333 branch, if you want to update your local code
2015-05-29T17:44:03 <michelled> thx simonjb
2015-05-29T17:44:35 <simonjb> michelled: this was the only issue you found so far?
2015-05-29T17:44:57 <michelled> well, and the french of course
2015-05-29T17:44:58 <Justin_o> anastasiac: do we have to be able to understand the words?
2015-05-29T17:45:07 <michelled> hehe - no Justin_o
2015-05-29T17:45:25 <anastasiac> here\xe2\x80\x99s your chance to learn some Spanish, Justin_o
2015-05-29T17:45:42 <Justin_o> anastasiac: i should have watched Dora the Explorer
2015-05-29T17:45:48 <anastasiac> :-)
2015-05-29T17:47:05 * anastasiac loves listening to the different speech engines read the english
2015-05-29T17:47:58 * Bosmon7 joined the channel
2015-05-29T17:48:19 <simonjb> why does English in a French accent sound lovely but French in a North American accent sound aweful?
2015-05-29T17:48:31 <michelled> ha - such a good question
2015-05-29T17:48:35 <Bosmon7> simonjb - almost anything in a North American accent sounds awful :)
2015-05-29T17:48:47 <anastasiac> I was just listening to the German accent. Interesting
2015-05-29T17:49:11 <anastasiac> ooh, my Grackle is visiting me. such interesting sounds...
2015-05-29T17:49:12 <michelled> Justin_o: are you going to review anastasiac\'s pull? it fixes french, which will help a lot
2015-05-29T17:49:30 <michelled> we should Grackle to the language panel
2015-05-29T17:49:35 <anastasiac> LOL
2015-05-29T17:49:41 <anastasiac> yes, we should!
2015-05-29T17:49:57 <Justin_o> michelled: yes, i am
2015-05-29T17:50:12 <michelled> thx!
2015-05-29T17:50:50 <anastasiac> the dutch voice in safari sounds vaguely like kasper...
2015-05-29T17:52:31 <Bosmon7> No, surely the German voice sounds like Kasper :)
2015-05-29T17:53:14 <michelled> simonjb: is there anything else I can test for you?
2015-05-29T17:54:02 <simonjb> not at thme moment, thanks michelled
2015-05-29T17:54:17 <michelled> np
2015-05-29T17:54:42 <michelled> Justin_o, anastasiac, Bosmon7, jhung: can I test anything for any of you?
2015-05-29T17:55:08 <anastasiac> michelled, you could try out my FLOE-311 branch\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x93\xc2\xa0the spanish translation
2015-05-29T17:55:42 <anastasiac> Justin_o: regarding your comment about renaming the english files. It\xe2\x80\x99s obviously not necessary, it still works, but would it eliminate all the console error messages?
2015-05-29T17:56:58 <Bosmon7> anastasiac - no, it wouldn\'t
2015-05-29T17:57:11 <Bosmon7> We\'ll have to put up with them unless we want to start a new model for "compiling" server resources
2015-05-29T17:57:18 <Bosmon7> Which we probably should anyway
2015-05-29T17:57:26 <Bosmon7> It will mean a somewhat annoying "build step" though
2015-05-29T17:58:31 <michelled> oh, interesting issue with the translation, anastasiac. it says I should press \'A\' for help
2015-05-29T17:58:35 <michelled> which of course won\'t work
2015-05-29T17:59:00 <michelled> so, should we say press \'H\' for help? or should we implement something that changes the quick key based on your language selection?
2015-05-29T17:59:02 <anastasiac> yes, michelled  \xe2\x80\x93 also, would A give you help? or take you back?
2015-05-29T18:00:36 * anastasiac is adjusting her shade umbrella and wondering if she can work from home for the whole summer\xe2\x80\xa6
2015-05-29T18:00:52 <michelled> so, I think we should simply our lives and have the other language still press \'h\'
2015-05-29T18:01:06 <michelled> we\'ll probably get feedback on that and we can open a JIRA about it
2015-05-29T18:01:53 <anastasiac> michelled: could you add that comment to the pull request? for the record...
2015-05-29T18:02:01 <michelled> yep
2015-05-29T18:02:23 <Justin_o> michelled: we may want to use a different key than \'h\' in general later.. simon and I were talking a bit about this a while back, but something we can discuss more later i guess.
2015-05-29T18:03:51 <anastasiac> michelled, Justin_o: most \xe2\x80\x9ccorrectly,\xe2\x80\x9d we should make the keystrokes configurable :-)
2015-05-29T18:04:32 <anastasiac> Justin_o, thoughts on renaming the english bundles, given it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really fix anything? do you think we should do it? or were you just wondering?
2015-05-29T18:07:17 <Justin_o> anastasiac: wondering, but it would probably be more explicit about what should be in there
2015-05-29T18:08:11 <anastasiac> good point, Justin_o
2015-05-29T18:10:54 <michelled> Bosmon7: I just noticed that if I decrease the size of the tool in step 6, the navigation icons get cut off when I got to step 7
2015-05-29T18:11:01 <michelled> is this a known issue?

2015-05-29T11:27:26 <Justin_o> Bosmon: I was thinking about the suggestion you gave me yesterday regarding the tooltip items
2015-05-29T11:27:30 <Justin_o> and distribute options
2015-05-29T11:27:56 <Justin_o> so that would only work on init, but what happens in the case where the idToContent is changed after the fact?
2015-05-29T11:28:06 <Bosmon> Justin_o - the component doesn\'t support that workflow in any case
2015-05-29T11:28:18 <Bosmon> It commits itself to working with either content or idToContent on startup
2015-05-29T11:28:28 <Justin_o> Bosmon: sure, that\'s okay
2015-05-29T11:28:41 <Bosmon> But I guess you\'re thinking about the case where the actual id set in idToContent might change
2015-05-29T11:28:43 <Justin_o> Bosmon: but i mean, to modify the items afterwards
2015-05-29T11:28:50 <Justin_o> yes, exactly
2015-05-29T11:29:00 <Bosmon> In that case, the user would have had to have supplied a selector which could match this situation anyway
2015-05-29T11:29:12 <Bosmon> Since as far as I\'m aware, the underlying tooltip can\'t reread its "items" option anyway
2015-05-29T11:29:22 <Bosmon> That is, the jQuery UI tooltip widget
2015-05-29T11:30:14 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i think you can, http://api.jqueryui.com/tooltip/#option-items
2015-05-29T11:30:27 <Justin_o> it says you can set/get the items after init
2015-05-29T11:30:47 <Bosmon> Justin_o - ok
2015-05-29T11:30:57 <Bosmon> Well, this would represent an extension of our functionality anyway
2015-05-29T11:31:12 <Bosmon> It implies we would have a model listener that recomputed the items option based on the contents of "idToContent"
2015-05-29T11:31:26 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes
2015-05-29T11:32:08 <Bosmon> And the presence of THAT listener would also have to be decided on startup : P
2015-05-29T11:32:15 <Justin_o> Bosmon: in terms of fixing this in the FD Tool, i could probably get around all the issues by having a class on all the elements we want to be tooltips and not worry about changing anything in Infusion, if we want to take more time to think about the proper solution
2015-05-29T11:32:32 <Bosmon> Justin_o - that seems a lot more direct, yes
2015-05-29T11:32:43 <Bosmon> The tooltip widget has numerous problems in this area in any case
2015-05-29T11:33:09 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay, i\'ll just try to add the class in the FD tool then
2015-05-29T11:33:13 <Bosmon> Since it was designed well before the model relay system worked properly
2015-05-29T11:33:56 <Bosmon> Or even existed : P
2015-05-29T11:34:20 <Bosmon> We can add this to our "architectural debt JIRAs" resulting from this work
2015-05-29T11:36:26 <Justin_o> Bosmon: sounds good.. i\'ll write something up for it
2015-05-29T11:38:29 * jhung joined the channel
2015-05-29T11:44:42 <Justin_o> Bosmon: http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5672
2015-05-29T11:44:53 <Justin_o> feel free to modify that as needed
2015-05-29T12:05:49 <Bosmon> Thanks for the writeup, Justin_o
2015-05-29T12:06:01 <Bosmon> So I\'m interested in the relation between FLOE-361 and FLUID-5672
2015-05-29T12:06:40 <Bosmon> hmm ok yes, I do see it now
2015-05-29T12:06:56 <Bosmon> It\'s that the widget believes we have directed it to construct a new tooltip, even if the content for it is the same
2015-05-29T12:08:57 <Bosmon> I wonder if there\'s a chance that this might resolve FLOE-327 as well
2015-05-29T12:09:05 <Bosmon> I hadn\'t debugged into that fully
2015-05-29T12:09:23 <Bosmon> But it seems conceivable that this is just another case of being directed to "spuriously construct a further tooltip"
2015-05-29T12:09:39 <Bosmon> Perhaps, triggered by the click event along some odd pathway
2015-05-29T12:18:11 <Justin_o> b
2015-05-29T12:18:39 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i was thinking they might be related, and hope that fixing FLOE-361 will just take care of FLOE-327

2015-05-29T13:23:59 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i\'m running into a bug
2015-05-29T13:24:17 <Bosmon> Justin_o - surely not!
2015-05-29T13:24:20 <Justin_o> Bosmon: for the range panels, either of the panels with the + and - buttons
2015-05-29T13:24:36 <Justin_o> the tooltips stick around, they don\'t go away after clicking not the buttons
2015-05-29T13:24:56 <Bosmon> Justin_o - what should cause them to go away?
2015-05-29T13:24:57 <Justin_o> i think this may have something to do with the rendering, as they are re-rendered after the value is changed
2015-05-29T13:25:00 <Justin_o> any thoughts?
2015-05-29T13:25:20 <Justin_o> the tooltip component from Infusion has a call to close all of the tooltips onDestroy
2015-05-29T13:25:25 <Bosmon> ok
2015-05-29T13:26:00 <Justin_o> my only thought is that somehow the openIdMap is somehow out of sync or it\'s calling the method from the wrong instance
2015-05-29T13:26:12 <Justin_o> maybe it\'s something more obvious but i\'m not sure
2015-05-29T13:26:18 <Justin_o> did you want me to push something up?
2015-05-29T13:27:29 <Justin_o> Bosmon: https://github.com/jobara/first-discovery/tree/FLOE-361
2015-05-29T13:27:42 <Justin_o> that\'s my branch that adds the tooltip class to use for items
2015-05-29T13:28:06 <Justin_o> the text size and speech rate panels exhibit this problematic behaviour.. the rest of the tooltips seem to be working okay
2015-05-29T13:28:14 <Bosmon> Justin_o - did the behaviour change after you added the class?
2015-05-29T13:28:30 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes
2015-05-29T13:28:33 <Justin_o> i worked before
2015-05-29T13:30:31 <Bosmon> Justin_o - how does the id of the lingering tooltip compare with any that you see at this line: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/components/tooltip/js/Tooltip.js#L92
2015-05-29T13:30:42 <Bosmon> Is it in the map at this time?
2015-05-29T13:40:39 <Justin_o> Bosmon: it looks like the openIdMap is empty
2015-05-29T13:40:49 <Justin_o> and it might only be happening when i click fast
2015-05-29T13:42:20 <Bosmon> Justin_o - perhaps you can log at this line to discover when it happens to seem closed and why - https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/components/tooltip/js/Tooltip.js#L79
2015-05-29T13:49:51 <sepideh> Good morning michelled, there is no one in the office. I just wanted to let you know that I have an interview scheduled with Jorge at 49 mcCaul at 10:00. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go there and should be back by 10:30. Just in case if anyone was looking for me. thx

2015-05-29T14:05:38 <Justin_o> Bosmon: but it seems if i click it fast, a new one is created before the old one is destroyed
2015-05-29T14:05:51 <Justin_o> at least this is how it seems visiually
2015-05-29T14:07:30 <Justin_o> Bosmon: seems in chrome it might be even more noticeable, so maybe it isn\'t the speed

2015-05-29T14:52:05 <Bosmon> Hi there Justin_o - sorry that we don\'t seem to be getting to the bottom of it yet - unfortunately I need to head out for the day now
2015-05-29T14:52:22 <Bosmon> If you can leave a summary of what you have discovered and how to reproduce the issue when you go today, I can take a look at it tomorrow
2015-05-29T14:52:34 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks for the help
2015-05-29T14:53:30 <Bosmon> Justin_o - np - tooltips are pretty hard things to debug, but I\'m sure we\'ll sort it out before long
2015-05-29T14:53:46 <Bosmon> There\'s certainly something odd seeming to be going on relating to relay of click to mouseenter events
2015-05-29T14:54:18 <Bosmon> As well as tracing all of our creation of tooltips, you might also want to put some traces in jQuery\'s event loop to see if that sheds any light on the exact sequence of what happens
2015-05-29T14:54:35 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay. i\'ll try that too
2015-05-29T14:55:53 <jhung> Justin_o: I noticed in the markup there is a reference to an un-used font icon for "volume". Is it safe to remove this? I think the tests use it, but the actual component does not?
2015-05-29T14:56:49 <Justin_o> jhung: probably, I don\'t think it should matter for the tests, but we should probably update the test to use the correct icon
2015-05-29T14:57:12 <jhung> ok Justin_o.
2015-05-29T15:04:06 <Justin_o> Bosmon: here\'s another log, that is some what more interesting. It looks like the tooltip widget doesn\'t exist anymore which would explain why it can\'t close the element.
2015-05-29T15:04:14 <Justin_o> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/qm5e2lq6
2015-05-29T15:04:48 <Justin_o> In first set it\'s on hover, which looks fine. Then when I click, you can see that the tooltip is logged to undefined or []
