2015-07-17T14:17:11 <alanharnum> cindyli: I am finding this tutorial helpful for getting a better handle on D3: http://square.github.io/intro-to-d3/
2015-07-17T14:18:10 <cindyli> great. thanks, alanharnum
2015-07-17T14:18:49 <alanharnum> i'm a little worried (not sure that's the word) that we may need to get down a lot into raw D3 to accomplish what we want if we go this route
2015-07-17T14:20:40 <alanharnum> at minimum it's becoming clear that we'll need a handle on D3 even if we find a suitable higher-level library
2015-07-17T14:28:23 <cindyli> alanharnum: that very likely would be true. i think it would be ok as long as we don't need to go down to D3 very often. the good thing is, the ability to directly dealing with D3 for some special handling gives us more power and flexibility. also, we will evaluate other non-D3 routes too
2015-07-17T14:28:32 <alanharnum> yeah
2015-07-17T14:29:41 <alanharnum> something like http://www.chartjs.org/ may be worth looking at (canvas-based)
2015-07-17T14:30:28 <alanharnum> the space is really crowded, which makes it challenging to select
2015-07-17T14:33:10 <alanharnum> we timeboxed 5 days for the research, correct?
