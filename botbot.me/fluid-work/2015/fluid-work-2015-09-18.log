2015-09-18T16:27:10 <cindyli1> thanks, Justin_o. will take a look soon
2015-09-18T16:27:16 <Justin_o> thanks
2015-09-18T16:30:47 <gtirloni> jessm: very interesting documentary, thx. quite inspiring.

2015-09-18T16:33:28 <Justin_o> cindyli1: can you remind me where the notes are from our meeting with Bosmon and simonjb about the structure of the security docs in couch
2015-09-18T16:34:05 <cindyli1> Justin_o: https://wiki.gpii.net/w/CouchDB_security_persistence_2015-09-14
2015-09-18T16:34:22 <Justin_o> cindyli1: thanks
2015-09-18T16:34:27 <cindyli1> np
2015-09-18T16:36:20 <Justin_o> simonjb: I\'m looking at the notes from our couchdb meeting with boson.
2015-09-18T16:36:21 <Justin_o> bosmon
2015-09-18T16:36:27 <Justin_o> "using gpiiToken rather than userId as our public indexing scheme for users, and ii) using the oauth clientId rather than the raw CouchDB document index as our index for clients"
2015-09-18T16:36:50 <Justin_o> does that mean that couch still has an _id field and a gpiiToken or clientId: field
2015-09-18T16:37:17 <Justin_o> or just the _id filed with the value that would have been at gpiiToken / clientId
2015-09-18T16:38:27 <simonjb> I believe the later
2015-09-18T16:38:53 <simonjb> Justin_o: it depends on whether the _id field is required or not
2015-09-18T16:39:03 <simonjb> if it\'s required, then we would need to set it
2015-09-18T16:39:49 <Justin_o> simonjb: i guess i mean, is the structure like {_id: "some_uuid", gpiiToken: "someToken"} or "{_id: "someToken"}
2015-09-18T16:39:51 <simonjb> but if CouchDB can be told that some other named property is the id, then would could use something else
2015-09-18T16:40:18 <simonjb> ah, ok
2015-09-18T16:40:56 <simonjb> Justin_o: that depends on the individual situation
2015-09-18T16:41:42 <simonjb> the advantage of the _id: "someToken" is that we can reduce the number of queries in some cases
2015-09-18T16:42:04 <simonjb> but it limits us to having only one record for that id
2015-09-18T16:42:11 <Justin_o> i\'m wondering about this statement in the integration section "We have a "dataSource" written in Kettle which simply abstracts Couch\'s update semantics for PUT/POST requests, and eliminates the need for clients to parse and restore _rev and _id fields"
2015-09-18T16:42:41 <simonjb> in general it\'s a good practice to always a synthetic primary key, as it provides the most flexibility
2015-09-18T16:42:59 <simonjb> but for CouchDB, we may want to consider other options
2015-09-18T16:43:14 <Justin_o> simonjb: okay, so {_id: "some_uuid", gpiiToken: "someToken"} is probably what we were expecting
2015-09-18T16:43:29 <Justin_o> hmm.. okay.. well i\'ll start with this for now, and see how things go i guess
2015-09-18T16:45:43 <Justin_o> simonjb: also any reason why i shouldn\'t put our test data for security in the top level testData directory in universal.
2015-09-18T16:46:58 <simonjb> Justin_o: that seems reasonable to me, just make a subdirectory for it
2015-09-18T16:47:44 <simonjb> Justin_o: actually, what is the scope of this testData?
2015-09-18T16:48:24 <simonjb> Justin_o: for acceptance tests or for really using the system?
2015-09-18T16:49:06 <Justin_o> simonjb: i\'m putting it in a security sub directory. Users, clients, etc for testing. I guess the views will go somewhere in the gpii-oauth2-datastore directory
2015-09-18T16:49:12 <Justin_o> as that will actually be needed for us
2015-09-18T16:49:13 <Justin_o> use
2015-09-18T16:50:17 <simonjb> Justin_o: ok, that sounds good to me
2015-09-18T16:50:57 <Justin_o> simonjb: thanks
2015-09-18T16:53:53 <cindyli1> Justin_o: i replied to your comments for FLUID-5770.

2015-09-18T16:59:30 <Justin_o> avtar, cindyli1, simonjb: I\'ve added test data for the couchdb docs in my GPII-1274 branch. https://github.com/jobara/universal/tree/GPII-1274/testData/security
2015-09-18T17:04:50 <cindyli1> cool. thanks, Justin_o
2015-09-18T17:06:57 <cindyli> Justin_o: you have "_id" fields in those json data, i guess they will be replaced by what avtar showed us of "_id": {{items[0]}}. Just wonder if they could be removed from testData files to reduce the confusion?
2015-09-18T17:07:29 <Justin_o> cindyli: avtar was asking us to add them in to the documents so that they wouldn\'t have to use the templating.
2015-09-18T17:07:40 <Justin_o> at least that\'s how i understood it
2015-09-18T17:07:44 <Justin_o> avtar: could you confirm?
2015-09-18T17:07:45 <cindyli> ok
2015-09-18T17:07:51 <avtar> cindyli: those replacements only take place when the preferences server is deployed
2015-09-18T17:08:25 <avtar> err.. when a couchdb instance is deployed for the preferences server

2015-09-18T17:09:09 * slim_ has quit
2015-09-18T17:10:05 <cindyli> i see. so "_id"s might be useful for development setup such as when using pounchDB, Justin_o, avtar?
2015-09-18T17:11:01 <avtar> cindyli: i\'m not super familiar with pouchdb so i can\'t comment :/
2015-09-18T17:11:10 <cindyli> :)
2015-09-18T17:13:14 <avtar> but as far as i know these preferences sets https://github.com/GPII/universal/tree/master/testData/preferences have never contained the _id fields because the preferences server used a development environment that didn\'t rely on couchdb, it accessed the documents directly from the file system
2015-09-18T17:13:52 <avtar> so for production environments, where couchdb was/is used, the sets had to be modified before couchdb would accept them
2015-09-18T17:17:47 <gtirloni> avtar: are you familiar with PunchDB ? http://bit.ly/1LCKVsP

2015-09-18T12:56:34 <cindyli> Justin_o: the infusion master also has a new commit merged in to remove the use of all "autoInit" in the infusion. we probably wanna upgrade infusion in the FLOE-416 to include that change too since when I search "autoInit" in my FLOE-331 branch, it still shows up for https://github.com/jobara/first-discovery/blob/FLOE-416/src/lib/infusion/src/components/textToSpeech/js/MockTTS.js that sits in the lib infusion directory
2015-09-18T12:57:04 <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks for spotting those. I\'ll do that today
2015-09-18T12:57:19 <cindyli> thanks, Justin_o
2015-09-18T13:06:01 <cindyli> Justin_o: in FLOE-416, a use of "fluid.eventedComponent" that can be replaced with "fluid.component": https://github.com/jobara/first-discovery/blob/FLOE-416/src/js/panels.js#L928

2015-09-18T15:17:42 <cindyli1> ok
2015-09-18T15:18:25 <Justin_o> cindyli1: i\'ll fix that up now, but it may take me a bit of time to sort things out.
2015-09-18T15:19:33 <cindyli1> i know, with all those changes. fortunately, selfVoicing tests are relatively on its own. thanks, Justin_o
