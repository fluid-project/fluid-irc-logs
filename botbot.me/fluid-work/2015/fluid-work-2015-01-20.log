2015-01-20T18:31:49 <Bosmon> Hi there simonjb - I just added in a further test for the revocation workflow for the OAuth2 server and unfortunately it did uncover a bug
2015-01-20T18:32:28 <Bosmon> the getSelectedPreferences API is returning preferences for records even though they are revoked - I imagine that either it or the upstream findAuthDecisionById API should have the task of filtering them out
2015-01-20T18:32:31 <Bosmon> https://github.com/amb26/universal/commit/0e501dd9b7fd5c91b2fcf389b814463440634a2e#diff-148c5f9733c2749a29c69e382e8f46a6R111
2015-01-20T18:32:46 <Bosmon> I've added a fix to my test case commit here, see if you think it is in the appropriate place
2015-01-20T18:33:04 <simonjb> thanks Bosmon

2015-01-20T18:38:04 <simonjb> Bosmon: sorry, just chatting with colin right now
2015-01-20T18:39:07 <Bosmon> No worries - I think this issue will not show up with the UI that we have currently got
2015-01-20T18:39:17 * colinclark has quit
2015-01-20T18:39:25 <Bosmon> Since there is no client request that will attempt to fetch a single auth record
2015-01-20T18:39:56 <Bosmon> So I still think it represents something that the risks don't outweigh the benefits for merging for the review
2015-01-20T18:40:14 <simonjb> Bosmon: agreed, let's look after the review
2015-01-20T18:40:18 <Bosmon> I mean, the other way round
2015-01-20T18:40:25 <Bosmon> The risks DO outweigh the benefits :)
2015-01-20T18:40:29 <simonjb> :)
