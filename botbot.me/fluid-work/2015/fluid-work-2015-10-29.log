2015-10-29T17:41:36 <simonjb> kasparne_: there isn\'t a lot of documentation for the hybrid flow manager -- but yes, we should add some -- here\'s what we have: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/configs/untrusted.development.all.local.txt

2015-10-29T17:42:05 <kasparne_> what do you get from an: echo %NODE_ENV%
2015-10-29T17:42:06 <kasparne_> ?

2015-10-29T17:43:04 <kasparne_> and you got the review4 branch of universal checked out as well?
2015-10-29T17:43:46 <andresmalarres> yes, freshly fetched from upstream
2015-10-29T17:45:05 <andresmalarres> i\'m just going to use a regular cmd just in case...
2015-10-29T17:46:31 <andresmalarres> ...oh is worst, it crashes even with sammy
2015-10-29T17:47:04 <andresmalarres> should i say that i\'m using an online Context Aware Server rather than the localhost one?
2015-10-29T17:47:42 <andresmalarres> 18:45:50.830:  FATAL ERROR: Uncaught exception: Error - this thread is already marked to a different request. Make sure to invoke this request asynchronously.
2015-10-29T17:49:29 <andresmalarres> oh Alicia in PowerShell reverting the CASConnector to localhost doesn\'t crash, but in the browser i get:

2015-10-29T17:50:50 <Justin_o> Bosmon: another kettle request question
2015-10-29T17:51:24 <Justin_o> Bosmon: how should I send the model data for a request like application/x-www-form-urlencoded
2015-10-29T17:51:35 <Justin_o> should i just serialize it myself and pass in a string as the model?
2015-10-29T17:51:39 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes
2015-10-29T17:51:54 <Justin_o> okay, thanks, so there\'s not built in method to do this in the kettle request?
2015-10-29T17:52:31 <simonjb> hi cindyli, are you available for a question about https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/gpii-oauth2/gpii-oauth2-authz-server/public/src/components/privacySettings/js/EditPrivacySettings.js (I know it was a while ago)
2015-10-29T17:52:32 <Bosmon> Justin_o - no, not currently - it only understands JSON bodies as builtin
2015-10-29T17:52:55 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay thanks, i\'ll just use this for the serialization https://nodejs.org/api/querystring.html
2015-10-29T17:53:12 <Bosmon> Justin_o - sure - make sure to set the correct content header too :)
2015-10-29T17:53:39 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes thanks, i think i have that in place already
2015-10-29T17:53:57 <cindyli> sure, simonjb, we probably can use fluid-tech channel
2015-10-29T17:54:47 <Bosmon> Justin_o - looks like the one that is already in our dependency tree as a result of the express body-parser is this one: https://www.npmjs.com/package/qs
2015-10-29T17:54:58 <Bosmon> You could marginally consolidate our dependencies by using this one instead
2015-10-29T17:55:12 <Bosmon> Although we are currently bound to version 4
2015-10-29T17:55:55 <Bosmon> I guess I can update my deps later
2015-10-29T17:55:56 <andresmalarres> kasparne_: slim__: jhernandez do your installations work with Alicia?
2015-10-29T17:56:24 <Bosmon> This looks like body-parser current: https://github.com/expressjs/body-parser/blob/master/package.json
2015-10-29T17:56:36 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i think the one i mentioned comes with node, but i could be wrong
2015-10-29T17:56:47 <Bosmon> Justin_o oh yes, of course, sorry
2015-10-29T17:56:49 <Bosmon> Ignore me : P
2015-10-29T17:56:52 <Justin_o> :)

2015-10-29T14:44:16 <the-t-in-rtf1> @avtar, @gtirloni, @amatas:  I am getting ready to restart the Unified Listing to pick up some changes.  The changes and rollback strategy are detailed here:  https://issues.gpii.net/browse/UL-68
2015-10-29T14:44:42 <the-t-in-rtf1> I am pinging you here in case I miss a tripwire or notification mechanism so you don\'t worry unnecessarily.
2015-10-29T14:45:31 <gtirloni> the-t-in-rtf1: ok thanks for the heads up
2015-10-29T14:45:37 <gtirloni> we\'ll disable the auto-destruct button :P
2015-10-29T14:49:37 * slim_ joined the channel
2015-10-29T14:57:36 <the-t-in-rtf1> The old version has no user-facing components, so the risk of a public outcry seems low.

2015-10-29T14:58:15 <Justin_o> Bosmon: to get the "set" method for a kettle datasource i just need to set the writable option to true right?
2015-10-29T14:58:31 <Bosmon> Justin_o - right
2015-10-29T14:59:02 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i\'m getting an error that says my datasource has no method "set"
2015-10-29T14:59:38 <Justin_o> i\'m using the datasource as a subcomponent and accessing it like that.accessTokenDataSource.set
2015-10-29T14:59:44 <Justin_o> Bosmon: ^
2015-10-29T14:59:53 <Justin_o> with arguments passed in
2015-10-29T15:00:10 <Bosmon> Justin_o - do you see any difference with this setup? https://github.com/amb26/kettle/blob/KETTLE-32/tests/DataSourceTests.js#L553
2015-10-29T15:00:15 <Bosmon> Perhaps you have made a typo
2015-10-29T15:02:08 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i\'m using a grade that has "kettle.dataSource.URL" as a base grade
2015-10-29T15:02:34 <Justin_o> i\'ll try using it directly in case there is something strange, although my grade just sets writable to true right now
2015-10-29T15:04:32 * jhung joined the channel
2015-10-29T15:04:57 <Justin_o> it get a different error when i use it directly, my gpii-express router times out
2015-10-29T15:05:17 <Justin_o> but the set method is probably an issue with my grade, but not sure why
2015-10-29T15:05:25 <Justin_o> for the time being i don\'t need a separate grade though
2015-10-29T15:06:02 <Justin_o> :(
2015-10-29T15:06:08 <Justin_o> i think i had a typo in gradenames
2015-10-29T15:06:29 <Justin_o> Bosmon: ^
2015-10-29T15:06:34 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes
2015-10-29T15:07:03 <Justin_o> Bosmon: actually it was okay
2015-10-29T15:07:17 <Justin_o> so strange
2015-10-29T15:07:21 <Justin_o> this is what my grade looks like
2015-10-29T15:07:25 <Justin_o> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/CKnDnyT7/
2015-10-29T15:08:13 <Bosmon> Justin_o - looks ok to me
2015-10-29T15:08:15 <Bosmon> What is the typo?
2015-10-29T15:08:34 <Justin_o> i thought there was a typo in gradeNames, but i made a mistake
2015-10-29T15:08:37 <Justin_o> so there was no type
2015-10-29T15:08:39 <Justin_o> typo

2015-10-29T15:10:02 * jhung joined the channel
2015-10-29T15:10:15 <Bosmon> Ah Justin_o
2015-10-29T15:10:16 <Bosmon> Ok yes
2015-10-29T15:10:20 <Bosmon> There is a fault in this impl
2015-10-29T15:10:33 <Bosmon> I\'ll just issue a fix and test case
2015-10-29T15:10:49 <Justin_o> Bosmon: cool thanks, what was wrong?
2015-10-29T15:11:00 <Bosmon> It\'s this line here: https://github.com/amb26/kettle/blob/KETTLE-32/lib/dataSource.js#L174
2015-10-29T15:11:11 <Bosmon> It faultily relies on the concrete "typeName" of the grade
2015-10-29T15:11:16 <Bosmon> Which is always a mistake
2015-10-29T15:12:45 <Justin_o> Bosmon: is it still looking at the original grade in that case?
2015-10-29T15:14:45 <Bosmon> Justin_o - it looks at whatever happens to be in "type", yes
2015-10-29T15:15:02 <Bosmon> In theory we should get rid of the distinction between "type" and the other gradeNames - but it remains useful in overriding situations
2015-10-29T15:15:25 <Bosmon> It\'s at the moment pretty much our only route for REMOVING an original grade which something had
2015-10-29T15:15:33 <Justin_o> Bosmon: oh
2015-10-29T15:16:07 <Bosmon> But certainly noone should rely on any predictable results from trying to INSPECT the "type" field that something has after it has constructed
2015-10-29T15:16:16 <Bosmon> SInce it\'s really "just another grade"
2015-10-29T15:17:04 <slim__> Bosmon: how is the work on node 4 going?
2015-10-29T15:17:13 <Bosmon> slim__ - pretty well
2015-10-29T15:17:17 <slim__> don\'t relax - haha - https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/3466 so many breaking changes
2015-10-29T15:17:28 <Bosmon> All the base libraries are now fine and I\'m working on upgrading universal
2015-10-29T15:17:39 <slim__> that\'s good.
2015-10-29T15:17:52 <Bosmon> slim__ - well that doesn\'t bother us, we plan to stick with node 4.2.1 LTS for some years
2015-10-29T15:18:14 <slim__> good to hear but 4.2.x ?
2015-10-29T15:18:24 <Bosmon> Yes well, whatever the LTS version is designated as
2015-10-29T15:18:35 <Bosmon> Whatever it is, we believe it will be something that does not break regularly : P
2015-10-29T15:18:37 <slim__> I\'m confusedto be honest
2015-10-29T15:18:51 <slim__> they promise :-/
2015-10-29T15:19:24 <Bosmon> We are only just BARELY in the condition that our crucial dependent libraries build under node 4 - like ws and node-ffi
2015-10-29T15:19:33 <Bosmon> We\'re not going to be moving off this version for a while :)
2015-10-29T15:20:05 <slim__> oh, interesting.
2015-10-29T15:20:21 <Bosmon> ws was only fixed a week or two ago
2015-10-29T15:21:25 <slim__> Bosmon: on another topic - possibly useful npm link I just discovered - https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/config
2015-10-29T15:21:59 <Bosmon> slim__ at least this page exists
2015-10-29T15:22:07 <Bosmon> I was unable to discover the equivalent page for node.js itself
2015-10-29T15:22:15 <slim__> I will test you on it later!
2015-10-29T15:22:29 <slim__> bah! poor show node devs
2015-10-29T15:22:56 <Bosmon> I had to look at the source to find what command-line options node.exe accepts

2015-10-29T15:26:35 <colinclark> Bosmon: We will definitely stick with 4.2.x LTS for as long as is reasonable
2015-10-29T15:26:53 <colinclark> It is interesting to see how Node 5 has finally switched to npm 3
2015-10-29T15:26:58 <Bosmon> Yes
2015-10-29T15:27:44 <colinclark> I really wonder how the future will look, especially for native Node modules
2015-10-29T15:28:03 <colinclark> I\'ve been sitting here contemplating what I will say if an osc.js user reports "It doesn\'t work with Node 5.0.0!"
2015-10-29T15:28:15 <colinclark> I think it\'s highly likely that I will simply follow LTS releases
2015-10-29T15:28:32 <colinclark> and expect that support for nodes in between will be dependent on community contributions
2015-10-29T15:28:41 <colinclark> since ultimately it will massively depend on third-party library support
2015-10-29T15:28:42 <colinclark> such as ws
2015-10-29T15:34:49 <Bosmon> yes
2015-10-29T15:35:07 <Bosmon> Justin_o - you can update to the latest version of my branch for a fix: https://github.com/amb26/kettle/tree/KETTLE-32

2015-10-29T17:30:14 <kasparne_> http://preferences.gpii.net/preferences/Alicia
2015-10-29T17:31:03 <slim__> andresmalarres: I guess it depends what NP sets were shipped with whatever system you are running
2015-10-29T17:31:22 <slim__> The default ones are all here - https://github.com/GPII/universal/tree/master/testData/preferences as far as I know
2015-10-29T17:31:54 <slim__> ok sorry kasparne_  -yes so much better to test at run time!
2015-10-29T17:33:34 <kasparne_> slim__: yeah - we\'re running the tests with the production setup so they should be located at the preferences server for things to work when going through the review4 scenarios
2015-10-29T17:33:55 <kasparne_> slim__: but you\'re right in the general case
2015-10-29T17:34:06 <slim__> That reminds how can I found out about the various possible deployments now?
2015-10-29T17:34:23 <slim__> I\'m usedto everyhting being local but would love to reconfig to use cloud stuff
2015-10-29T17:34:37 <slim__> if that makes sense
2015-10-29T17:34:51 <slim__> There\'s that new flow manager too
2015-10-29T17:34:56 <slim__> kasparne_: ^^
2015-10-29T17:35:40 <slim__> Is there an overview yet - or is that another chapter in my O\'Reilly book? :)
2015-10-29T17:36:37 <kasparne_> probably your book :)... Theoretically, you could look in the universal/gpii/configs folder
2015-10-29T17:37:16 <kasparne_> those are the ones that are immediately available with the NODE_ENV variable
2015-10-29T17:37:26 <kasparne_> but they\'re probably a bit cryptic to figure out
2015-10-29T17:37:46 <andresmalarres> thanks guys
2015-10-29T17:37:49 <kasparne_> but I dont think there is any documentation for the new modes yet ( simonjb would know)
2015-10-29T17:38:39 <andresmalarres> yes Alicia is on preferences.gpii.net but i get an error in my machine
2015-10-29T17:39:03 <andresmalarres> i did the node_env thing
2015-10-29T17:39:47 <andresmalarres> in git bash, in power shell... with no success
2015-10-29T17:40:11 <kasparne_> how do you start the GPII?
