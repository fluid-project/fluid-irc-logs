2015-01-05T15:19:09 <michelled> cindyli, Justin_o: given that you are heads down with the security work, I think we won\'t bother to do a floe planning meeting today
2015-01-05T15:19:27 <michelled> jhung: if you have a few minutes, do you want to have a quick chat?
2015-01-05T15:19:39 <jhung> sure michelled
2015-01-05T15:19:47 <jhung> let me know when is a good time.
2015-01-05T15:19:54 <Justin_o> michelled: thanks
2015-01-05T15:19:56 <cindyli> ok, thanks, michelled
2015-01-05T15:20:12 <michelled> now\'s good - I\'m calling you on vidyo
2015-01-05T15:22:20 <simonjb> colinclark: no problem, I\'d like to chat with you and Bosmon2 or Bosmon7 about some remaining tasks and plan details for the demo review
2015-01-05T15:23:00 <Bosmon7> simonjb - great
2015-01-05T15:23:15 <Bosmon7> simonjb - I\'ve committed some updated test cases to my branch btw
2015-01-05T15:23:47 <simonjb> Bosmon7: yes, I saw -- thanks -- will merge into my branch soon
2015-01-05T15:23:51 <Bosmon7> It now tests every possible disruption of the OAuth conversation that seemed obviously helpful
2015-01-05T15:23:58 <simonjb> Bosmon7: awesome
2015-01-05T15:24:17 <colinclark> simonjb: Let\'s do it
2015-01-05T15:24:21 <colinclark> I\'ll be free in about an hour
2015-01-05T15:24:27 * colinclark has quit
2015-01-05T15:24:29 <Bosmon7> https://github.com/amb26/universal/commit/e55b2806ffbf8e6bf9e1878a4b1408bfc21106e7#diff-78edb5851c709ca6a6e86bb70b1de661R90
2015-01-05T15:24:33 <simonjb> Bosmon7: I also have some updates on my branch (from both myself and Justin_o)
2015-01-05T15:24:40 <Bosmon7> It checks that each of these routes result in an authentication failure
2015-01-05T15:24:53 <Bosmon7> Most of them do, although the status codes are a bit all over the place
2015-01-05T15:25:00 <Bosmon7> One route leads to a 5xx rather than a 4xx
2015-01-05T15:25:27 <simonjb> Bosmon7: the 5xx sounds like something worth investigating -- which one?
2015-01-05T15:25:36 <Bosmon7> And I noticed that omitting the "accept=true" form field for the decision request still results in a redirect
2015-01-05T15:25:47 <Bosmon7> simonjb - you can read off the resulting status codes from the structure I just pasted a link to
2015-01-05T15:25:59 <Bosmon7> Since for the time being I just adjusted the test cases so that they passed : P
2015-01-05T15:26:43 <simonjb> Bosmon7: ah, yes, I think the OAuth2orize implementation might be any POST without a cancel is an accept rather than a POST with an accept -- I can take a look at the source
2015-01-05T15:26:57 <Bosmon7> aha ok
2015-01-05T15:26:58 <Bosmon7> https://github.com/amb26/universal/commit/e55b2806ffbf8e6bf9e1878a4b1408bfc21106e7#diff-78edb5851c709ca6a6e86bb70b1de661R123
2015-01-05T15:27:06 <Bosmon7> This is the track that leads to a 501
2015-01-05T15:27:43 <Bosmon7> Caused by not including a grant_type field
2015-01-05T15:27:51 <Bosmon7> I guess it is arguable that a 501 is reasonable in this case
2015-01-05T15:28:11 <Bosmon7> Interestingly we get a 403 rather than a 401 by omitting the redirect_uri
2015-01-05T15:29:22 <simonjb> 403 seems reasonable I think
2015-01-05T15:30:18 <simonjb> and actually the 501 is also probably ok
2015-01-05T15:30:58 <simonjb> but when we have more time, it would be good to check through them
2015-01-05T15:31:13 <simonjb> Bosmon7: thanks for implementing this test -- really good to have
2015-01-05T15:32:13 <simonjb> Bosmon7: colin said he would be free in about an hour, is that good for you?

2015-01-05T15:43:46 <simonjb> Bosmon7: https://github.com/jaredhanson/oauth2orize/blob/master/lib/middleware/decision.js#L96
2015-01-05T15:58:54 <Bosmon7> simonjb - thanks for this link
2015-01-05T15:59:24 <Bosmon7> If we wanted to change this behaviour, would we have any alternative to just copying the code out?
2015-01-05T15:59:58 <Bosmon7> I think I won\'t be able to make the meeting later, still taking a day with relatives
2015-01-05T16:00:03 <Bosmon7> I\'ll be fully back at work tomorrow
2015-01-05T16:00:45 <simonjb> Bosmon7: ok, can we chat briefly for 10 mins now?
2015-01-05T16:00:54 <Bosmon7> ok sure
2015-01-05T16:01:05 <simonjb> Bosmon7: are you able to do skype?
2015-01-05T16:15:09 <simonjb> Bosmon7: regarding OAuth2orize and the cancel/accept, I think we might be able to execute some middleware before the decision middleware which checks the form data and sets req.oauth2.res.allow
2015-01-05T16:15:48 <Bosmon7> simonjb - ok
2015-01-05T16:16:12 <Bosmon7> I guess we can do this because we are the ones responsible for scheduling the ordering of adding middleware to the routes?
2015-01-05T16:16:23 <simonjb> Bosmon7: yes, exactly
2015-01-05T16:16:30 <Bosmon7> cool

2015-01-05T19:41:53 <colinclark> jhung: Hey
2015-01-05T19:42:24 <colinclark> Jutta just mentioned that she\'d really like to see inclusive design reflected as part of the Fluid Project website
2015-01-05T19:43:01 <colinclark> Can we update the tag line at the top of the site to reflect this in some way?
2015-01-05T19:44:06 <colinclark> Something like "Fluid is an open, collaborative community dedicated to inclusively designing open source software."
2015-01-05T19:44:56 <jhung> Of course colinclark. I\'ll take a look at the text.
2015-01-05T19:47:53 <colinclark> and "The Fluid community consists of an international team of collaborators focused on designing inclusive, flexible, and user-centred interfaces for the web."
2015-01-05T19:47:55 <colinclark> or something liket hat
2015-01-05T19:47:57 <colinclark> thanks jhung
2015-01-05T19:48:04 <colinclark> She also mentioned a Safari issue that I can\'t reproduce
2015-01-05T19:48:21 <colinclark> the line spacing is really tight on her browser
2015-01-05T19:48:21 <colinclark> she\'s running the latest Safari
2015-01-05T19:48:35 <colinclark> If you can double check that it also looks cool on your machine, I think we\'re okay ;)
2015-01-05T19:48:44 <jhung> sure colinclark
2015-01-05T19:49:05 <colinclark> thanks, man
