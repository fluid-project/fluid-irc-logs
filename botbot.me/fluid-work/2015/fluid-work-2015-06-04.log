2015-06-04T19:46:45 <sepideh> anastasiac do you happen to remember when you started working on these three projects and when you finished? 1. Learner\xe2\x80\x99s option 2. Infusion  3. Metadata Authoring Tool
2015-06-04T19:46:47 <sepideh> thx
2015-06-04T19:47:31 <anastasiac> sepideh: infusion = fluid project so same start date, and it is still ongoing
2015-06-04T19:48:37 <sepideh> I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a start date for Fluid, the only thing I know is that it started before Floe
2015-06-04T19:49:29 <anastasiac> sepideh: based on when we created the fluid wiki, I\xe2\x80\x99d say it started in 2007 :-)
2015-06-04T19:49:53 <sepideh> Great!! thanks a lot anastasiac
