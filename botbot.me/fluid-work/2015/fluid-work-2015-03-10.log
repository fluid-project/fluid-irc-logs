2015-03-10T18:22:35 <jhung> anastasiac: perhaps use the convention other plugins use? I think "wp-" comes first typically.
2015-03-10T18:26:19 <anastasiac> jhung, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been looking through github for such repositories, and I haven\xe2\x80\x99t really found much of a concensus. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen both wp and wordpress, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the name start with that, and not
2015-03-10T18:27:13 <anastasiac> although I think \xe2\x80\x9cofficial\xe2\x80\x9d plugins are all in svn...
2015-03-10T18:30:38 <jhung> anastasiac: alright. I don\'t have a strong opinion about the name.
2015-03-10T18:33:26 <simonjb> Bosmon, Bosmon7: I\'ve extracted the OKCancelDialog in https://github.com/simonbates/universal/commit/70e7457e7fc3c61ce399f2d5870366969885ce9b -- if you could have a look over, that would be great! thanks

2015-03-10T19:33:47 <anastasiac> hm
2015-03-10T19:34:04 <anastasiac> that feels kind of odd, jhung
2015-03-10T19:34:17 <anastasiac> I think it would be better to put that info into the ILDH itself
2015-03-10T19:34:22 <anastasiac> what do yout hink?
2015-03-10T19:36:03 <jhung> anastasiac: good point. I\'ll document some of the issues / todos there.
2015-03-10T19:36:16 <anastasiac> great, thanks jhung
2015-03-10T19:57:21 <michelled> cindyli: dana says she can meet now on skype
2015-03-10T19:57:34 <cindyli> yay cool
2015-03-10T19:57:50 <michelled> anastasiac, colinclark: are you also available?
2015-03-10T19:58:20 <anastasiac> yes, I\xe2\x80\x99m available michelled
2015-03-10T19:58:30 <anastasiac> skype? not vidyo?
2015-03-10T19:59:01 <michelled> dana can\'t do video at home
2015-03-10T19:59:03 <anastasiac> k
2015-03-10T20:00:45 <cindyli> interesting, i don\'t have dana on my contact list. that\'s no good, can someone start the call, anastasiac, michelled?
2015-03-10T20:00:56 <michelled> is colinclark around?

2015-03-10T20:07:26 <jhung> anastasiac: I updated the pull req. Use the FLOE-240-2 branch in my repo, not the FLOE-240 branch.
2015-03-10T20:07:39 <anastasiac> ok, jhung, got it
2015-03-10T20:21:06 <Bosmon> Hey there simonjb - looks really great!
2015-03-10T20:21:45 <Bosmon> I think you just need a call to container.dialog("destroy") registered in the component\'s onDestroy, and you are good to go
2015-03-10T20:22:34 <Bosmon> And a couple of dedicated tests for the dialog itself, just to verify that it\'s capable of operating at all outside the parent tree....
2015-03-10T20:22:44 <simonjb> ok, awesome, thanks Bosmon (cindyli was hugely helpful in guiding me also)
2015-03-10T20:22:48 <jhung> anastasiac: I just realized that we\'ll need to update the EPUB in the CDN as well. jobara helped do that last time - I\'m not sure how this is done.
2015-03-10T20:23:28 <anastasiac> ah, I was going to ask you how you did it last time, jhung :-) I guess we\xe2\x80\x99ll make this a sys-admin request when we\xe2\x80\x99re ready
2015-03-10T20:23:29 <simonjb> Bosmon: ok, will add the onDestroy and some tests, thanks very much for looking it over
2015-03-10T20:24:15 <simonjb> Bosmon: what do you think about the location/namespace? ok where it is or move it somewhere more central/general?
2015-03-10T20:26:05 * clown_mtg has quit
2015-03-10T20:27:09 <Bosmon> simonjb - I think it could go into gpii.OKCancelDialog
2015-03-10T20:27:51 <simonjb> Bosmon: and where would be the best place for it to live in the project structure?
2015-03-10T20:28:16 <Bosmon> at its own level in /public/src/components seems reasonable?
2015-03-10T20:28:38 <Bosmon> That is, gpii-oauth2-authz-server/public/src/components/OKCancelDialog ?
2015-03-10T20:29:38 <simonjb> yep, that seems reasonable, thanks Bosmon!
2015-03-10T20:29:58 <Bosmon> np!

2015-03-10T14:27:37 <Bosmon> I think the-t-in-rtf could find it useful
2015-03-10T14:28:39 <cindyli> yes, still half way tho, pushing up the latest ...
2015-03-10T14:30:18 <jhung> anastasiac: I see pull requests for FLOE0282 and FLUID-5601. Do you want me to look at those?
2015-03-10T14:30:33 <jhung> anastasiac: nevermind. I just refreshed my browser
2015-03-10T14:30:34 <jhung> :)
2015-03-10T14:33:26 <jhung> I can take a look at pulls #31 and #32 for the Floe site anastasiac.

2015-03-10T17:18:17 <colinclark> Hi palashkaria
2015-03-10T17:18:47 <palashkaria> but I couldn\'t find The Fluid Project on GSoC website!
2015-03-10T17:19:08 <colinclark> Sadly, we weren\'t accepted as an organization this year
2015-03-10T17:19:31 <colinclark> apparently Google had unprecedented interest for GSoC 2015
2015-03-10T17:19:39 <colinclark> and was only able to fund 1/3 of the applicants

2015-03-10T17:30:45 * colinclark has quit
2015-03-10T17:30:47 <michelled> cindyli, anastasiac, colinclark: I\'m available right now for about half an hour if you want to go through the script.
2015-03-10T17:30:58 <cindyli> modelListeners: {
2015-03-10T17:30:59 <cindyli> "magnificationFactor": {
2015-03-10T17:30:59 <cindyli> funcName: "gpii.pmt.enactors.magnification.magnify",
2015-03-10T17:31:06 <michelled> otherwise, I\'ll be available again after the furnace guy leaves - I\'d guess around 2:30
2015-03-10T17:31:50 <cindyli> Bosmon: are those two keywords equivalent or there\'s a differnece?
2015-03-10T17:32:01 <Bosmon> cindyli - currently equivalent
2015-03-10T17:32:07 <cindyli> ok, thanks, Bosmon
2015-03-10T17:32:18 <Bosmon> The plan is to eliminate "listener" once we have time
2015-03-10T17:32:34 <Bosmon> I think it just creates one more odd thing to remember
2015-03-10T17:32:41 <Bosmon> The original implementation only allowed "listener"
2015-03-10T17:32:58 <Bosmon> And recently I extended it to allow the standard IoC directives that we support in invokers
2015-03-10T17:33:20 <anastasiac> michelled, cindyli, colinclark, I\xe2\x80\x99m available
2015-03-10T17:33:21 <cindyli> Bosmon: is there a reason we wanna eliminate "listener", which sounds more proper for registering listeners
2015-03-10T17:34:23 <Bosmon> cindyli - I felt it was nonstandard
2015-03-10T17:34:28 * palashkaria has left the channel
2015-03-10T17:34:32 <Bosmon> We use one syntax in one kind of record, and another in another
2015-03-10T17:34:38 <cindyli> michelled, anastasiac, colinclark, shall we go thru the script when Dana is in since she\'s the one who created the scenario. she went for a meeting and will be back some time after 3PM
2015-03-10T17:34:50 <Bosmon> I thought it would make the framework easier to learn if we just used one record structure for the two cases
2015-03-10T17:35:08 <cindyli> that\'s true
2015-03-10T17:35:26 * colinclark joined the channel
2015-03-10T17:35:40 <michelled> sounds good cindyli - ping me when she\'s back
2015-03-10T17:36:04 <cindyli> certainly, michelled. will you be available after 3?
2015-03-10T17:36:08 <anastasiac> cindyli, do you have a copy of the script, so I could look it over in advance?
2015-03-10T17:36:24 <michelled> yep, I\'m available
2015-03-10T17:37:19 <cindyli> anastasiac: Dana did pm me some links, unfortunately i lost that conversation session.
2015-03-10T17:37:31 <anastasiac> ok, cindyli, no problem

2015-03-10T18:21:23 <anastasiac> cindyli, colinclark, jhung, simonjb: suggestions for a github repository name for the UIO wordpress plugin? \xe2\x80\x9cuio-wordpress-plugin\xe2\x80\x9d ? \xe2\x80\x9cuio-wp-plugin\xe2\x80\x9d ? other?
2015-03-10T18:21:44 <colinclark> either seems pretty reasonable to me, with a small preference for the former
