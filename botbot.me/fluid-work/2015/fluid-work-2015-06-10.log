2015-06-10T14:27:25 <cindyli> Justin_o: i think it's probably no longer valid since the example was using fss

2015-06-10T15:39:03 <danayo> it's blocked anastasiac

2015-06-10T15:53:00 <maozillah> the two jiras that dana and I were talking about according to the UIO a11y review in regards to design, https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5686 & https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5678
2015-06-10T15:53:32 <anastasiac> fluid-everyone: sorry about running out of stand-up, I had to help with a load of lumber. If I missed anything I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have, pleas ping me
2015-06-10T15:54:06 * sepideh joined the channel
2015-06-10T15:56:54 <danayo> thanks maozillah, the on/off toggle that justin referred to is shown in these designs from Cloud for All project https://www.dropbox.com/s/58z9jqcj7rr0flm/adjusters-postpilot-redesign-annotated.pdf?dl=0\\

2015-06-10T17:14:26 <maozillah> danayo: ohh wonder if that\xe2\x80\x99s what Justin_o was referencing
2015-06-10T17:14:55 <danayo> well, the toggle design is specifically what he was referring to - did you see the other link I posted above?
2015-06-10T17:15:03 * michelled has quit
2015-06-10T17:15:04 <maozillah> yep!
2015-06-10T17:15:04 <danayo> it came out of Cloud for All work
2015-06-10T17:15:07 <danayo> cool
2015-06-10T17:16:17 <maozillah> i think it would be a good idea to replace the two checkboxes with the on/off toggles
2015-06-10T17:17:32 <danayo> I agree maozillah!
2015-06-10T17:18:14 <danayo> also here is a editable version of UIO designs https://www.dropbox.com/s/7v0nf3e4fb6zajh/UPDATESVNuio-highfidelity-version3-onpage.pdf?dl=0
2015-06-10T17:18:29 <danayo> I'm trying to find the mockups that match this existing implementation
2015-06-10T17:18:36 <danayo> but those are close
2015-06-10T17:19:24 <danayo> we should probably be using the fluid-design channel maozillah, let's move there :)

2015-06-10T18:01:57 <Justin_o> is there some sort of backend being used for that demo?
2015-06-10T18:03:45 <cindyli> Justin_o: looks like having mammals demo communicating with the prefs server
2015-06-10T18:09:28 <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks, in your experience with model transformations do you know if this one can be closed https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-4727
