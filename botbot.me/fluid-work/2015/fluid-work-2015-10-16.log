b'2015-10-16T12:25:19 <kasparnet> Bosmon: I\'m still getting an error.. I\'ve added the fluid.identity in between the files, and removed the double "onMessage"
2015-10-16T12:25:20 <kasparnet> : https://github.com/kaspermarkus/universal/tree/GPII-1314-2
2015-10-16T12:26:00 <Bosmon> kasparnet - https://github.com/kaspermarkus/universal/blob/GPII-1314-2/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/test/PCPInterfaceTests.js
2015-10-16T12:26:03 <Bosmon> Looks just the same to me!
2015-10-16T12:26:08 <kasparnet> haha
2015-10-16T12:26:18 <Bosmon> YOu can\'t fool me with your Danish tricks so easily
2015-10-16T12:26:22 <kasparnet> I was just just looking at it - looks like I forgot to add a file
2015-10-16T12:26:28 <Bosmon> We British have learned a thing or two in 1000 years
2015-10-16T12:27:39 <kasparnet> hehe yeah, unfortunately
2015-10-16T12:28:04 <kasparnet> it was much more fun when we could just plunder you, burn your houses, etc
2015-10-16T12:28:14 <Bosmon> Yes, I\'m sure it was : P
2015-10-16T12:28:19 <kasparnet> instead of trying to trick you with JIRAs :)
2015-10-16T12:28:38 <kasparnet> anyway, I\'ve updated it now
2015-10-16T12:28:41 <kasparnet> https://github.com/kaspermarkus/universal/blob/GPII-1314-2/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/test/PCPInterfaceTests.js
2015-10-16T12:29:11 <Bosmon> Ok
2015-10-16T12:29:15 <Bosmon> So what happens when you run this?
2015-10-16T12:29:17 <kasparnet> and the failing part is that of line 133 -- it will get the login message (again) that was retrieved on line 122
2015-10-16T12:29:32 <Bosmon> Wow, wild
2015-10-16T12:30:08 <Bosmon> Ok, I\'ll debug into it shortly - just need to hop into the SHAWER first
2015-10-16T12:30:44 <kasparnet> no worries
2015-10-16T12:30:51 <kasparnet> it\'s not anything blocking for the review, etc
2015-10-16T12:31:15 <kasparnet> and I can test the functionality fine without that one test
2015-10-16T12:31:43 <Bosmon> Ok.... still it\'s pretty urgent
2015-10-16T12:31:46 <Bosmon> I\'ll tackle it today
2015-10-16T12:32:30 <Bosmon> oh wait
2015-10-16T12:33:18 <Bosmon> well no, this should be fine
2015-10-16T12:34:11 <Bosmon> I\'m surprised that your "listenOnInit" works though, in all cases I\'ve tried this, it tries to connect before the server has started listening on its socket
2015-10-16T12:34:20 <Bosmon> But it shouldn\'t have any bearing on this problem
2015-10-16T12:34:50 <Bosmon> Oh wait
2015-10-16T12:34:51 <Bosmon> YOu dunderhead
2015-10-16T12:34:54 <Bosmon> You\'re doing it yourself
2015-10-16T12:35:05 <Bosmon> What do you think you\'re doing with this!
2015-10-16T12:35:06 <Bosmon> https://github.com/kaspermarkus/universal/blob/GPII-1314-2/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/test/PCPInterfaceTests.js#L34
2015-10-16T12:35:07 <Bosmon> : P
2015-10-16T12:35:14 <Bosmon> More pesky Danish tricks
2015-10-16T12:35:27 <Bosmon> There\'s ALREADY a listener which relays messages to onMessage
2015-10-16T12:35:30 <Bosmon> And now you added a 2nd one
2015-10-16T12:36:10 <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/blob/master/lib/test/KettleTestUtils.js#L186
2015-10-16T12:36:23 <Bosmon> THis is how the client already works
2015-10-16T12:36:39 <Bosmon> So now you have two listeners relaying every message to a firing of onMessage
2015-10-16T12:55:11 <kasparnet> hmmm... where is the the other listener relaying messages to \'onMessage\'?
2015-10-16T12:56:26 <kasparnet> Bosmon: ^

2015-10-16T14:17:51 <kasparnet> hahahaha indeed
2015-10-16T14:17:51 <the-t-in-rtf> Speaking of which, I asked you before, what\'s the scoop on the Christmas beer.
2015-10-16T14:18:08 <the-t-in-rtf> I remember trucks with a countdown driving around in November.
2015-10-16T14:18:18 <the-t-in-rtf> or October, can\'t remember which.

2015-10-16T11:07:04 <slim__> thanks mr T!
2015-10-16T11:07:30 <slim__> was going to ask what happened to the call to winsetres.exe in test solutions file
2015-10-16T11:07:54 <slim__> however I've found it in my old GPII-1000 branch
2015-10-16T11:08:08 <slim__> guess it never got merged to master or got clobbered
2015-10-16T11:08:17 <slim__> NP will not make it to PR
2015-10-16T11:08:22 <slim__> One Q
2015-10-16T11:09:00 <slim__> when you have 2 related PRs; one in universal and one in windows repos is there an offical wya of lining them?
2015-10-16T11:09:07 <slim__> Or just cross link in the PR comments?
2015-10-16T11:09:17 <slim__> the-t-in-rtf: ^^^^
2015-10-16T11:12:31 <the-t-in-rtf> I would suggest commenting on the fact that they are related.
2015-10-16T11:14:22 <the-t-in-rtf> I'm assuming one of the related ones depends on the other via package.json?
2015-10-16T11:15:29 <the-t-in-rtf> When I have situations like that I end up pinning the dependency to the latest commit hash in the pull request.  Until we have versioned releases, that should be OK.
2015-10-16T11:15:43 <the-t-in-rtf> @slim__ ^^^^
2015-10-16T11:27:39 <slim__> the-t-in-rtf: sounds good
2015-10-16T11:29:03 <the-t-in-rtf> In the world of versioned releases you would cut the dependent releases, then cut the releases of the packages that depend on them.
2015-10-16T11:29:10 <the-t-in-rtf> It is a bit of a dance.
2015-10-16T12:11:27 <Bosmon> Yes, github is very good about crosslinking pull request threads
2015-10-16T12:11:44 <Bosmon> YOu'll notice that a notification appears in the target's thread once you link to it from a source pull
2015-10-16T12:12:22 <Bosmon> kasparnet - I've responded on your GPII-1314, there is indeed a long-standing bug in this area, but you should be able to work around it the way I suggested
2015-10-16T12:12:51 <Bosmon> Basically the rule is, never try to write two listeners in a row, and everything should then appear to be sequenced fine
2015-10-16T12:16:18 <kasparnet> thanks for the reply, Bosmon - I'm gonna try it out now (and re-replied in the JIRA as well)
2015-10-16T12:17:12 <kasparnet> hey slim__ sorry for not seeing your ping till now
2015-10-16T12:17:25 <kasparnet> it's sounds like things were cleared up though
2015-10-16T12:17:39 <slim__> kasparnet:
2015-10-16T12:18:02 <slim__> NP - trying to merge my olds display settings solution entry using setres - much has changed
2015-10-16T12:18:25 <kasparnet> btw, we never merged the solution registry entry into master, as it had a dependency on an external file and that we had talked from the beginning about making an improved version
2015-10-16T12:18:27 <slim__> for some reason it's no longer in win32 solutions file
2015-10-16T12:18:27 <kasparnet> cool
