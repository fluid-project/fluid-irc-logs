b'2015-02-13T18:58:17 <michelled> hmmm\xe2\x80\xa6 I don\'t see it on the build site. avtar I\'m not sure if the build got kicked with the recent merge
2015-02-13T18:58:36 <michelled> cindyli, Justin_o do you see it on the build site?
2015-02-13T18:58:39 <avtar> one sec
2015-02-13T18:59:44 <cindyli> yes, michelled, it\'s there on the build site
2015-02-13T18:59:51 <cindyli> open up http://build.fluidproject.org/first-discovery/demos/ in firefox
2015-02-13T19:00:27 <michelled> oh great! never mind avtar - it\'s working :)
2015-02-13T19:00:43 <cindyli> oh, michelled, Justin_o just merged the pull for top #2
2015-02-13T19:00:54 <cindyli> thanks, Justin_o
2015-02-13T19:00:54 <michelled> yay
2015-02-13T19:01:08 <Justin_o> cindyli: np, thank you
2015-02-13T19:01:22 <Justin_o> michelled: there\'s a pull request open and waiting for another round of review for the tab/focus order
2015-02-13T19:14:42 <jhung> Justin_o: the pull request for FLOE-272 should address the disabled state for the increase / decrease buttons.
2015-02-13T19:16:12 <Justin_o> jhung: those buttons weren\'t being disabled, does FLOE-272 disable them or is it just the styling you are referring to?
2015-02-13T19:16:44 <jhung> Justin_o: FLOE-272 has styles for disabled state.
2015-02-13T19:17:02 <Justin_o> jhung: okay, thanks.. i\'m working on disabling them but i\'ll won\'t worry about changing the style
2015-02-13T19:17:14 <jhung> yep exactly
2015-02-13T19:17:26 <jhung> anything else I can look at cindyli, Justin_o, anastasiac?
2015-02-13T19:18:17 <Justin_o> jhung: disable the help button
2015-02-13T19:19:55 <jhung> Justin_o: yep that is in FLOE-272. I added disabled property to the demo html file and the general disabled state style.
2015-02-13T19:20:13 <Justin_o> jhung: cool thanks.. not sure then
2015-02-13T19:20:42 <avtar> are there any other first-discovery related changes scheduled for today?
2015-02-13T19:20:48 <anastasiac> michelled, how would you like to user-test jhung\xe2\x80\x99s FLOE-272 branch?
2015-02-13T19:21:05 <anastasiac> avtar, yes, we will be making more pushes to master today, at least one or two
2015-02-13T19:21:10 <michelled> sure
2015-02-13T19:22:22 <avtar> ok i\'m going to switch over to using supervisor for jenkins. could you please ping me here before anything gets pushed to the repo?

2015-02-13T19:33:51 <jhung> michelled: not yet. Justin_o has a branch that adds disabled to the text size adjuster
2015-02-13T19:33:57 <cindyli> yes, i will, Justin_o. can you review mine for FLOE-276 - https://github.com/fluid-project/first-discovery/pull/24
2015-02-13T19:34:04 <Justin_o> cindyli: okay
2015-02-13T19:36:38 * Jess__ joined the channel
2015-02-13T19:40:28 <Justin_o> cindyli, anastasiac, michelled: I\'m thinking about the back button behaviour which cindyli was looking at in FLOE-276
2015-02-13T19:41:17 <michelled> jhung, anastasiac: the 272 branch changes look good to me
2015-02-13T19:42:01 * the-t-in-rtf joined the channel
2015-02-13T19:42:22 <anastasiac> jhung, I\xe2\x80\x99ve left a comment on your 272 branch pull request
2015-02-13T19:42:24 <jhung> anastasiac: I saw your comment. I\'ll make that fix now.
2015-02-13T19:42:34 <Justin_o> the check mark indicator on the icon is supposed to show that it has been accepted. Right now we are actually saving everything automatically. So i\'m not really sure that only showing it when you go forward is actually accurate
2015-02-13T19:42:37 <Justin_o> what do you think?
2015-02-13T19:43:38 <anastasiac> Justin-o, it\xe2\x80\x99s not only about saving, it\xe2\x80\x99s about whether or not the user has actively reviewed and agreed to the value. Next says yes, back says not necessarily
2015-02-13T19:44:02 <cindyli> or back says i\'m in the middle of adjusting it but not done yet
2015-02-13T19:44:17 <anastasiac> in fact, you could argue that the fact that we save anyway is encouragement to NOT show the arrow until next, so the user knows that they should look at this
2015-02-13T19:44:28 <anastasiac> right, cindyli
2015-02-13T19:44:34 * the-t-in-rtf has quit
2015-02-13T19:45:16 <michelled> I suppose the only confusion might be if they exit the tool without going through all the steps. will they be confused that values are saved for a non-checked off screen?
2015-02-13T19:45:28 <michelled> I guess at most it could only be one, though
2015-02-13T19:46:20 <anastasiac> michelled, I think if they exit the tool without going through all the steps, all bets are off as to what they should expect!
2015-02-13T19:47:06 <michelled> that\'s interesting - I suppose it might be something that gets figured out through user testing
2015-02-13T19:47:40 <anastasiac> michelled, one of the requirements is that prefs are saved as you go, just in case you\xe2\x80\x99re interrupted, or the system crashes, etc
2015-02-13T19:47:48 <anastasiac> so that\xe2\x80\x99s expected behaviour
2015-02-13T19:49:03 <michelled> ah, ok
2015-02-13T19:49:45 <anastasiac> Justin_o, could you clarify for me? Is it correct to say that if the user launches the tool and then quits without doing anything, a prefs set with the defaults is created?
2015-02-13T19:50:28 <Justin_o> anastasiac: i believe so
2015-02-13T19:50:36 <Justin_o> cindyli: can you confirm that?
2015-02-13T19:51:35 * the-t-in-rtf joined the channel
2015-02-13T19:53:49 <jhung> anastasiac / michelled: I pushed a small fix that makes the fd tool not shift in heigh when going from next / back.
2015-02-13T19:53:58 <jhung> For FLOE-272
2015-02-13T19:56:19 <cindyli> yes, Justin_o and anastasiac
2015-02-13T19:56:29 <anastasiac> ok. That\xe2\x80\x99s fine, I just want to make sure I know, so that I can answer the question if it\xe2\x80\x99s asked. Thanks, Justin_o and cindyli
2015-02-13T19:59:46 <Justin_o> cindyli: i added the extra test to FLOE-277
2015-02-13T19:59:57 <cindyli> thanks, Justin_o, will take a look

2015-02-13T20:09:59 <Justin_o> maybe anastasiac has an idea

2015-02-13T20:26:07 <cindyli> ok, Justin_o
2015-02-13T20:26:58 <michelled> is 276 the only outstanding pull for today? Justin_o, cindyli, jhung, anastasiac?
2015-02-13T20:27:28 <anastasiac> I saw 277 mentioned
2015-02-13T20:27:38 <cindyli> 277 has been merged

2015-02-13T20:32:57 <jhung> I just did a quick test in Chrome on Android. This is looking awesome.
2015-02-13T20:38:07 <anastasiac> Justin_o: 275 merged
2015-02-13T20:38:23 <Justin_o> anastasiac: thanks
2015-02-13T20:40:35 <anastasiac> Justin_o, what\xe2\x80\x99s the status of FLOE-271 - spoken on/off message? Is that the one we decided not to merge yet because it introduces something not-nice?
2015-02-13T20:41:40 <Justin_o> anastasiac: yes.. although it doesn\'t really make anything worse, it\'s just that you might not hear the message because the tooltip might be spoken when it shouldn\'t
2015-02-13T20:41:59 <anastasiac> ok, let\xe2\x80\x99s not worry about that yet
2015-02-13T20:42:01 <anastasiac> thanks
2015-02-13T20:45:25 <michelled> wait, does that mean first discovery deliverable 1 is done?
2015-02-13T20:47:17 <Justin_o> i think so
2015-02-13T20:48:27 <anastasiac> Justin_o, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry! I was just saying how happy I was that no one has to work late, and michelled tells me you were supposed to knock off at 2:30!
2015-02-13T20:48:57 <Justin_o> anastasiac: :) no worries.. i\'m going to slip off now
2015-02-13T20:49:07 <Justin_o> glad we got it all in.. good work everyone

2015-02-13T21:00:43 <Bosmon> It is "new new demands blocks" : P

2015-02-13T21:01:48 <cindyli> now the entire world is the ginger world ;)
2015-02-13T21:02:35 <Bosmon> Yes, it is
2015-02-13T21:02:50 <Bosmon> One further step closer to being able to achieve EVERYTHING through simply issuing fluid.defaults
2015-02-13T21:03:33 <Bosmon> And now you no longer escape the "global tree" as a result of trying to construct a "standalone component".....

2015-02-13T17:36:12 <anastasiac> Justin_o, in your tab order branch: should the contrast and tts controls be in the tab order? should they get focus and be activatable?
2015-02-13T17:36:45 <Justin_o> anastasiac: i had been wondering that too, but they were already focusable so i just changed the order they appeared in.

2015-02-13T17:45:52 <jhung> anastasiac: I submitted a pull request for mobile styling fixes.
2015-02-13T17:46:00 <anastasiac> Justin_o, how hard is it for the speech to say something other than what\xe2\x80\x99s visual on the screen?
2015-02-13T17:46:11 <anastasiac> jhung, thanks, I\xe2\x80\x99ll have a look shortly

2015-02-13T17:48:09 <jhung> cindyli, anastasiac, Justin_o: FYI in my pull request I have added a disabled button state style. So no need to create a style. Just add a disabled property to the element and the CSS should handle it.
2015-02-13T17:48:40 <anastasiac> great, jhung, thanks

2015-02-13T17:51:50 <anastasiac> jhung, we\xe2\x80\x99re in pretty good shape, actually
2015-02-13T17:51:58 <anastasiac> I\xe2\x80\x99m about to try out your styling issues
2015-02-13T17:52:30 * michelled has quit
2015-02-13T17:52:34 <anastasiac> I\xe2\x80\x99ve commented on Justin_o\xe2\x80\x99s tab-order pull request about trying to add focus styling to the tts and contrast controls. If he has any questions about that, you could help him out
2015-02-13T17:52:41 <anastasiac> I think he might be having lunch righ now
2015-02-13T17:52:43 <anastasiac> right
2015-02-13T17:53:00 * michelled joined the channel
2015-02-13T17:53:03 <Justin_o> me or jhung?
2015-02-13T17:53:59 <Justin_o> i was looking through the designs but didn\'t see any focus styling for those controls
2015-02-13T17:54:28 * michelled has quit
2015-02-13T17:54:30 <Justin_o> but i guess i can just apply something like what is there for the other elements
2015-02-13T17:54:54 * yzen has quit
2015-02-13T17:54:57 * michelled joined the channel
2015-02-13T17:55:19 <jhung> Justin_o: there is focus styling for those elements. It\'s already in the CSS.
2015-02-13T17:55:31 <jhung> They just need to be put in the tab order Justin_o
2015-02-13T17:55:38 <Justin_o> jhung: they are in the tab order
2015-02-13T17:55:51 * kasparnet joined the channel
2015-02-13T17:55:57 <jhung> Justin_o: let me check...
2015-02-13T17:55:57 <Justin_o> but i think the styling may be a bit different because it is the input that is in the tab order but the label is shown
2015-02-13T17:56:00 <Justin_o> my guess anyways
2015-02-13T17:56:49 <anastasiac> Justin_o and jhung, the android tablets I have aren\xe2\x80\x99t new enough to do the web speech API, and so now I can\xe2\x80\x99t even verify the styling because the tool doesn\xe2\x80\x99t launch :-)
2015-02-13T17:56:51 * michelled has quit
2015-02-13T17:56:55 <anastasiac> for testing, I might change that
2015-02-13T17:57:19 * michelled joined the channel
2015-02-13T17:57:22 <Justin_o> anastasiac: at least you confirmed the feature detection worked :)
2015-02-13T17:57:37 <anastasiac> Justin_o, focus styling should probably be pretty consistent across all controls
2015-02-13T17:58:06 <jhung> Justin_o: +1 it works. -1 now I can\'t use FF to debug.
2015-02-13T17:58:31 <Justin_o> jhung: don\'t know what you mean sorry
2015-02-13T17:58:53 <Justin_o> anastasiac: the problem is that the inputs are hidden and only the label shown. so it does work, you just can\'t see it ;)

2015-02-13T18:00:32 <jhung> @Justin_o I will look into that focus issue with the yes/no and contrast selector now
2015-02-13T18:00:42 <cindyli> Justin_o: can you review my pull request for FLOE-273 - https://github.com/fluid-project/first-discovery/pull/22

2015-02-13T18:17:18 <Justin_o> cindyli, anastasiac: I\'m looking over FLOE-273. The text ends with "select the arrow below" should it say start instead of arrow
2015-02-13T18:17:26 <Justin_o> if the user isn\'t sighted they won\'t know what to select
2015-02-13T18:17:55 <anastasiac> well, if they aren\xe2\x80\x99t sighted, they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t know it\xe2\x80\x99s an arrow, either
2015-02-13T18:18:19 <Justin_o> anastasiac: that\'s what i mean
2015-02-13T18:18:33 <Justin_o> it says to select the arrow but how will they know what that refers to
2015-02-13T18:18:38 <anastasiac> Justin_o, feel free to try something different
2015-02-13T18:18:44 * jhernandez has quit
2015-02-13T18:22:18 <cindyli> Justin_o, anastasiac, should it say "select the start button" so unsighted users know it\'s a button that can be tabbed onto
2015-02-13T18:22:35 <anastasiac> that sounds good
2015-02-13T18:22:38 <Justin_o> that would work for me
2015-02-13T18:22:45 <cindyli> ok, will make the change
2015-02-13T18:25:31 <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks
2015-02-13T18:28:27 <cindyli> anastasiac, Justin_o, seems the wording on the first panel is long enough that makes the panel height higher than other panels. so when the start button is clicked, the panel jumping shrink comes back.
2015-02-13T18:28:55 <anastasiac> cindyli, just take out the middle sentence
2015-02-13T18:29:09 <cindyli> ok, anastasiac
2015-02-13T18:30:53 <cindyli> Justin_o: the pull for FLOE-273 is ready for another look

2015-02-13T18:38:59 <jhung> Justin_o: I have made changes to FLOE-275. Do you want me to issue a pull to your repo or will you merge my branch?
2015-02-13T18:39:19 <Justin_o> jhung: thanks.. i can just merge your branch
2015-02-13T18:39:32 <jhung> ok

2015-02-13T18:39:51 <Justin_o> jhung: thanks
2015-02-13T18:39:55 <Justin_o> i was just looking for that
2015-02-13T18:42:08 <Justin_o> anastasiac: FLOE-275 is ready for review again. It includes jhung\'s focus styling fix
2015-02-13T18:42:40 <jhung> cindyli, anastasiac, Justin_o: what else can I help with?
2015-02-13T18:44:02 <Justin_o> jhung: maybe the disabled styling and disabling the help button if no one has started that yet..
2015-02-13T18:45:09 <jhung> Justin_o: There is a Disabled style in the FLOE-272 pull req. As long as the elements have the disabled property applied, it should just work.
2015-02-13T18:46:01 <jhung> * actually scratch that. I won\'t just work. The css selector needs to bre more specific for the yes/no and contrast radio button cases.
2015-02-13T18:46:08 <jhung> I\'ll work on that now Justin_o
2015-02-13T18:46:44 <Justin_o> jhung: okay, but i don\'t think those will be disabled for this round, and maybe not ever
2015-02-13T18:49:55 <cindyli> Justin_o: the pull for 273 is ready again
2015-02-13T18:50:10 <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks
2015-02-13T18:56:25 <michelled> cindyli, Justin_o: I havne\'t been following the channel. I know Justin_o is almost done for the day - where did you two get on our top 3 priorities for the tool today?
2015-02-13T18:56:53 <cindyli> michelled: top 2 are done, i\'m working on the 3rd one for the back button
2015-02-13T18:57:05 <michelled> did they get merged?
2015-02-13T18:57:28 <cindyli> well, Justin_o is reviewing the top #2 that i had a pull request on, michelled
2015-02-13T18:57:46 <cindyli> Justin_o\'s work on top #1 has been merged

2015-02-13T13:29:57 <cindyli> thanks, Justin_o
2015-02-13T13:30:37 <Justin_o> cindyli: I\'m struggling a bit with the tests though.. all the ones i can think of will recreate the same algorithm for finding the text that is in the component itself
2015-02-13T13:30:45 <Justin_o> cindyli: do you have any ideas?
2015-02-13T13:32:06 <cindyli> Justin_o: you have a function in fdhookup to find the panel information, can you call that function to compare the result
2015-02-13T13:33:15 <Justin_o> cindyli: yes, but i mean that to verify it, i\'d have to do the same thing as what is in that function
2015-02-13T13:33:23 <Justin_o> maybe i\'m not understanding you though
2015-02-13T13:39:45 <cindyli> i see what you mean, Justin_o, you do need a way to compose the string to be compared with, i think you can retrieve that directly from the msgLookup. for example, when you on the text size panel, grab the text size instruction directly from message files
2015-02-13T13:40:43 <Justin_o> cindyli: okay, but the test will be a little less robust since i\'ll have to know which panel goes with the markup
2015-02-13T13:41:35 * yzen joined the channel
2015-02-13T13:41:44 <jhung> Justin_o, cindyli: I am testing on Android 5 Chrome this morning and there are some styling issues. I\'m going to create a new Jira specifically for Android and iOS.
2015-02-13T13:42:30 <cindyli> Justin_o: that\'s how it works for now. the way we test the text size panel is to set the model value to 3 for it to be visible

2015-02-13T14:16:01 <cindyli> Justin_o: i\'m testing FLOE-271 branch. one issue i noticed is, when clicking the button to turn voice on, if u move the mouse away, the self voicing says "turn voice off" instead of "voice is on".
2015-02-13T14:16:54 <Justin_o> cindyli: it only says "voice is on" or "voice is off" when the button is clicked. Other wise it reads the tooltip
2015-02-13T14:18:02 <Justin_o> jhung, cindyli: were either of you working on the tab order?
2015-02-13T14:18:17 <cindyli> the issue i have is, if the button is clicked to turn on the voice and the mouse is moved right after the click, "voice is on" won\'t be announced, Justin_o
2015-02-13T14:18:25 <cindyli> Justin_o: i\'m not
2015-02-13T14:18:32 <jhung> Justin_o: nope

2015-02-13T14:18:53 <jhung> ok Justin_o
2015-02-13T14:18:58 <Justin_o> cindyli: as for the announcement, that\'s kind of how it is designed to work

2015-02-13T16:37:30 <anastasiac> cindyli, not today :-)
2015-02-13T16:37:36 <cindyli> ok
2015-02-13T16:38:01 <anastasiac> cindyli, if we have time, after the other things on our list are done, we should figure something out
2015-02-13T16:38:10 <cindyli> got it

2015-02-13T16:48:11 <Justin_o> cindyli, anastasiac: I updated the text for the unsupported message in my pull request
2015-02-13T16:49:03 <cindyli> thanks, Justin_o
2015-02-13T16:53:29 <cindyli> Justin_o: merged ur pull for FLOE-274
2015-02-13T16:53:37 <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks

2015-02-13T17:05:59 <Justin_o> michelled, anastasiac, cindyli: I\'m thinking about the tab order.. i think maybe we should just leave it at the document order for now. It might be confusing for a user who is trying to mute the self voicing to have to go forward in the tab order instead of back.
2015-02-13T17:06:42 <Justin_o> what do you think?
2015-02-13T17:07:20 <anastasiac> Justin_o, if it successfully and reasonably works in document order now, and does so even after switching \xe2\x80\x9cpages,\xe2\x80\x9d then I think that\xe2\x80\x99s ok for today. It\xe2\x80\x99s not what dana designed, but we can work on that later.

2015-02-13T17:10:07 <Justin_o> anastasiac: i can implement the order, although we won\'t be pushing focus to a control after navigating back/next
2015-02-13T17:10:22 <Justin_o> anastasiac: i\'m just not sure it won\'t be confusing, but i guess we could test that... so i can do either
2015-02-13T17:10:43 <Justin_o> also do we want the non-working controls to have keyboard focus?
2015-02-13T17:11:40 <anastasiac> Justin_o, I\xe2\x80\x99m ok with not pushing focus to a control after navigating, so long as the resulting behaviour isn\xe2\x80\x99t too odd.
2015-02-13T17:12:17 <Justin_o> focus will be on the back/next button depending on which was pressed
2015-02-13T17:12:36 <anastasiac> right
2015-02-13T17:13:54 <Justin_o> anastasiac: any thoughts on the controls for the adjusters that aren\'t functional?
2015-02-13T17:14:17 <anastasiac> Justin_o, what\xe2\x80\x99s the default behaviour in a browser when a button is disabled?
2015-02-13T17:14:33 <Justin_o> they aren\'t interactive
2015-02-13T17:15:04 <Justin_o> but i mean for something like contrast
2015-02-13T17:16:13 <Justin_o> oh never mind, they do get focus, it\'s just hard to see..
