2015-01-30T20:36:32 <anastasiac> will do, cindyli

2015-01-30T13:38:40 <anastasiac> jhung, polo
2015-01-30T13:38:58 <jhung> cstrobbe: yes. There\'s a fix for that we\'re putting in very soon.
2015-01-30T13:39:35 <cstrobbe> OK, thanks.
2015-01-30T13:39:37 <jhung> In the meantime you can find the information at http://fluidproject.org/projects.html cstrobbe or on our wiki: wiki.fluidproject.org
2015-01-30T13:39:45 <jhung> Thanks for pointing that out. :)
2015-01-30T13:41:03 <jhung> anastasiac: I noticed there are styles for TTS and other things in the CSS file. Should I leave those there? I don\'t see it being used currently.
2015-01-30T13:41:48 <anastasiac> jhung, if you find styles that are not actually being used, feel free to clean them up. I tried, but I obviously missed some :-)
2015-01-30T13:42:05 <jhung> ok anastasiac. Thanks.
2015-01-30T13:42:16 <anastasiac> no, thank *you*, jhung ;-)
2015-01-30T13:43:36 <jhung> Should I start implementing the other panels?
2015-01-30T13:43:42 <Bosmon> jhung, anastasiac - could I also remind about http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5576 ?
2015-01-30T13:43:49 <Bosmon> The links to our mailing lists have been broken for a while
2015-01-30T13:44:01 <jhung> Bosmon: yep. it\'s in a pull req.
2015-01-30T13:44:07 <Bosmon> aha
2015-01-30T13:44:14 <anastasiac> jhung, Bosmon, yes, I\xe2\x80\x99ll try to get that deployed today
2015-01-30T13:44:26 <Bosmon> great, thanks anastasiac!
2015-01-30T13:45:24 <anastasiac> jhung, if you mean the two others that are already there, yes. If you mean others, probably not yet
2015-01-30T13:46:27 <jhung> anastasiac: I only see one panel (Text size).
2015-01-30T13:46:52 <jhung> Are there others anastasiac?
2015-01-30T13:48:01 <anastasiac> jhung, if you look at the markup, you\xe2\x80\x99ll see that there are two other panels, before and after the tts, that are hidden by default. The text-size panel has an extra class that \xe2\x80\x9cshows\xe2\x80\x9d it. The other panels are there so we can demonstrate the back/next functionality. The adjusters won\xe2\x80\x99t actually work, but we will be displaying the panels
2015-01-30T13:48:12 <anastasiac> before and after the text-size, sorry
2015-01-30T13:48:37 <anastasiac> jhung, that might mean that you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have removed those tts styles, if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t know about the tts panel :-)
2015-01-30T13:49:19 <anastasiac> jhung, to work on the other two panels, you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to move the \xe2\x80\x9cfd-current\xe2\x80\x9d class over (probably now \xe2\x80\x9cgpii-current")
2015-01-30T13:50:22 <jhung> anastasiac: I seem to be missing something. My index.html only has "gpii-main" and it just contains the text size adjuster. Nothing else.
2015-01-30T13:50:43 <jhung> I\'ll check github to make sure I have everything.
2015-01-30T13:50:47 * Justin_o joined the channel
2015-01-30T13:50:51 <anastasiac> jhung, did you work with my FLOE-250 branch? https://github.com/acheetham/first-discovery/blob/FLOE-250/demos/index.html
2015-01-30T13:52:19 <jhung> yep
2015-01-30T13:53:16 <anastasiac> jhung, when you look a the link I just posted, can you see the other two panels?
2015-01-30T13:54:38 <jhung> interesting. I don\'t see those at all anastasiac.
2015-01-30T13:55:30 <jhung> when I do a git merge acheetham/FLOE-250 it says everything up to date\xe2\x80\xa6 so I *should* have this markup.
2015-01-30T13:55:32 <anastasiac> jhung, first panel, hidden,  starts on line 24; second panel, visible, starts on line 44; third panel, hidden, starts on line 65
2015-01-30T13:55:55 <jhung> I\'m missing those blocks completely anastasiac. it\'s not a problem with my eyes. :D
2015-01-30T13:56:10 <anastasiac> jhung, are they missing when you look at them in github??
2015-01-30T13:56:15 * cstrobbe has quit
2015-01-30T13:58:17 <jhung> I\'m looking at the history in my FLOE-250 branch now\xe2\x80\xa6
2015-01-30T13:59:08 <jhung> anastasiac: got it.
2015-01-30T13:59:50 <jhung> anastasiac: looks like I deleted those lines from index.html and committed it. Not sure why I would do that. :scratch:
2015-01-30T14:00:00 <jhung> I\'ll put those back in.
2015-01-30T14:03:08 <anastasiac> :-)
2015-01-30T14:11:50 <Justin_o> cindyli: i guess you removed the fl-focus class.. is there a reason you did this instead of adding in the fluid.css file?

2015-01-30T14:13:02 <Justin_o> cindyli: when you have a chance to talk through the component i have a couple of questions
2015-01-30T14:14:03 <cindyli> Justin_o: the entire index.html will be replace by anastasiac and jhung\'s the new index file in their FLOE-250 branch. it doesn\'t matter what css changes we currently made in there.
2015-01-30T14:14:20 <Justin_o> cindyli: okay
2015-01-30T14:15:00 <cindyli> i\'m available anytime you are, Justin_o

2015-01-30T14:31:10 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I didn\'t
2015-01-30T14:31:14 <Bosmon> Where did it appear?
2015-01-30T14:31:38 <Justin_o> it\'s for this pull request https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/583
2015-01-30T14:31:43 <Justin_o> for the tts related work
2015-01-30T14:35:38 <Bosmon> Thanks Justin_o - reviewing now
2015-01-30T14:39:26 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thank you
2015-01-30T14:49:47 <Bosmon> Justin_o - ok, I think I have done one round
2015-01-30T14:49:55 <Bosmon> Let me know if I shoudl clarify anything
2015-01-30T14:50:14 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks.. i\'ll take a look at your comments
2015-01-30T14:56:29 <anastasiac> Justin_o, do you know if the PCP and PMT can be used on a touch-only interface?
2015-01-30T14:57:35 <Justin_o> anastasiac: i\'m not sure, i don\'t know if it\'s really been tested on that. However, I don\'t think there are any sliders or anything any more so it would probably work.
2015-01-30T14:57:47 <anastasiac> ok, thanks Justin_o

2015-01-30T15:05:54 <Bosmon> Justin_o - as for cindyli\'s work, you should best consult with her about it
2015-01-30T15:06:01 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay
2015-01-30T15:06:30 <Justin_o> Bosmon:  did yo see my other replies to your comments?
2015-01-30T15:07:37 <Justin_o> cindyli: what Bosmon is referring to is your model relay work for the prefs framework. Do we know when that might go in, and what\'s holding it up at the moment?
2015-01-30T15:08:48 <cindyli> Justin_o: i\'m tied up with implementing the first discovery tool. haven\'t got a chance to address Bosmon\'s comments.
2015-01-30T15:09:17 <Bosmon> ok
2015-01-30T15:09:49 <Bosmon> It sounds like we should just leave that work in modelising as a "TODO" in Justin_o\'s branch
2015-01-30T15:09:55 <Bosmon> His branch will conflict with yours in any case
2015-01-30T15:10:04 <Bosmon> So there will be plenty of signals that it needs to be resolved
2015-01-30T15:11:59 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay.. i\'ll leave that as a TODO in mine

2015-01-30T15:36:12 <Justin_o> sure

2015-01-30T15:46:30 <cindyli> no, Justin_o
2015-01-30T15:46:40 <Justin_o> I mean after the pull request is merged
2015-01-30T15:46:46 <Justin_o> or can it be closed?
2015-01-30T15:47:09 <cindyli> it can be closed, Justin_o, i\'m carrying on in another branch 252
2015-01-30T15:47:23 <Justin_o> cindyli: okay, thanks
