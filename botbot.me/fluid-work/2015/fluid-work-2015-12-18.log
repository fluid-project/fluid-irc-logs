2015-12-18T17:31:06 <bens__> alanharnum, i\'ve updated readme.md with some specifics for running on bluemix here: https://github.com/pga03/docker-preferences-server
2015-12-18T17:32:04 <bens__> and if you diff that against gpii-ops/docker-preferences-server you will see all changes.. but i\'ll describe a few of them here
2015-12-18T17:32:06 * cindyli joined the channel
2015-12-18T17:32:27 <alanharnum> bens__: thanks - i\'m quite curious
2015-12-18T17:34:51 <bens__> alanharnum: COUCHDB_HOST environment variable became CLOUDANT_HOST and needs to be of the format https://user:pass@host.com. When you provision a cloudant service in bluemix you get a URL of this form and that is what you should use for the environment variable value. The protocol is specified in the URL and the port is omitted, so we changed the sed substitution in start.sh to accomodate that
2015-12-18T17:36:05 * anastasiac joined the channel
2015-12-18T17:39:15 <bens__> there were two issues that caused start.sh to abend because of the -e flag for /bin/sh: 1) bluemix has an issue connecting networking to the containers quickly. we worked around it by calling wait_for_networking.sh in a separate bash script so that curl exit codes other than 0 won\'t trigger the -e flag in start.sh. # Reference: https://developer.ibm.com/answers/questions/183427/calling-out-to-the-internet-from-a-docker-containe/?smartspace=bluemix. The sec
2015-12-18T17:39:16 <bens__> ond is that some of the test preference files could not be uploaded by kanso in the prime db logic. It seems they were not valid JSON and kanso had parse errors on a few but not all of them. The real fix there is to figure out the parse issue  but in the meantime I moved that to prime_db.sh so we can prime the database but ignore the couple of test file upload errors.
2015-12-18T17:43:32 <alanharnum> bens__: yeah there are some issues with some of the test files - i don\'t know if it\'s helpful but you might find https://github.com/waharnum/docker-preferences-server-data-loader interesting
2015-12-18T17:44:17 <alanharnum> that\'s a sidekick container I use to load the test data in the reconfiguration I\'m working on, which splits out the preferences server container itself from the test data loading
2015-12-18T17:45:32 <bens__> alanharnum: i\'m still investigating this one, but the preferences server had error logs at first that it did not have permissions to access the cloudant user database. This might be a material difference between cloudant and couchdb. the short term fix was to add reader/writer permission for all in cloudant but of course that is not a real fix

2015-12-18T18:06:01 <Justin_o> anastasiac: how did you mock up the environment variable in the description column
2015-12-18T18:06:44 <anastasiac> justin, I just added the env var to the description (\xe2\x80\x9cMaps to the XXX environment variable\xe2\x80\x9d) and put the example in a column
2015-12-18T18:06:49 <anastasiac> Justin_o: ^
2015-12-18T18:07:03 <anastasiac> I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if \xe2\x80\x9cMaps to\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d is the right phrasing, but...
2015-12-18T18:15:11 <Justin_o> anastasiac: i\'m not sure, it seems that the key piece of information there is the environment variable, as this is what an integrator will need to set
2015-12-18T18:15:16 <Justin_o> i\'d like to make sure that it\'s obvious
2015-12-18T18:15:50 <anastasiac> Justin_o: how about adding it to the Option Path column?
2015-12-18T18:15:53 <anastasiac> it\xe2\x80\x99s just so wide
2015-12-18T18:16:07 <anastasiac> I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to add it to another already wide column
2015-12-18T18:16:15 <anastasiac> the only other option is to not use a table
2015-12-18T18:20:03 <Justin_o> anastasiac: what were you thinking of for the no table version?
2015-12-18T18:20:35 * alanharnum joined the channel
2015-12-18T18:22:22 <Justin_o> anastasiac: i could also just remove the "Option Path" column form the environment table
2015-12-18T18:22:48 <Justin_o> anastasiac: someone would have to look things up in the actual config file though, and it wouldn\'t quite match the other config tables

2015-12-18T18:47:05 <Justin_o> it puts the options path and example under the description
2015-12-18T18:47:07 <anastasiac> thanks, Justin_o, I\xe2\x80\x99ll have a look
2015-12-18T18:47:14 <Justin_o> anastasiac: thanks
2015-12-18T18:57:35 <anastasiac> Justin_o: I think this new table works. It\xe2\x80\x99s not ideal (because it\xe2\x80\x99s different than the other two tables), but it\xe2\x80\x99s completely understandable.
2015-12-18T18:57:46 <anastasiac> Justin_o: did you address the other comments?
2015-12-18T18:58:35 <anastasiac> ah, looks like it...

2015-12-18T00:21:47 * jhernandez joined the channel
2015-12-18T00:25:17 <cindyli> hi Bosmon
2015-12-18T00:26:16 <Bosmon> Hi there cindyli
2015-12-18T00:26:19 <Bosmon> Working very late? : P
2015-12-18T00:26:28 <cindyli> 7:26pm
2015-12-18T00:26:41 <cindyli> not very late. u r the one who works really late
2015-12-18T00:27:08 <cindyli> i\'m using IoC testing framework to write some unit tests
2015-12-18T00:27:40 <cindyli> at the component instantiation, the component has an ajax call to set a model value
2015-12-18T00:28:22 <cindyli> i don\'t care the value that\'s set since it\'s in a subcomponent that\'s tested by another unit test
2015-12-18T00:29:57 <cindyli> however, the change of the model value in the subcomponent triggers the model relay to the parent component, but at then, the test has finished which causes an error to be thrown because the parent component has been destroyed by the testing framework
2015-12-18T00:30:07 <Bosmon> cindyli - yes, that is quite a familiar issue
2015-12-18T00:30:23 <Bosmon> The traditional scheme is to guard the interior of the listener by using a "fluid.isDestroyed()" test
2015-12-18T00:30:33 <Bosmon> It\'s a bit messy and we will improve this kind of thing in the future framework
2015-12-18T00:31:03 <Bosmon> Right now the only thing which it automatically guarded is the interior of standard event listeners
2015-12-18T00:31:14 <Bosmon> That is, any event listener notified after component destruction is automatically nulled
2015-12-18T00:31:37 <Bosmon> But that leaves two major sources of component behaviour which are not guarded - i) interior of invokers, ii) model listeners and relay
2015-12-18T00:32:59 <Bosmon> In case you are interested in more of the background, here are some relevant JIRAs which you might read:
2015-12-18T00:33:00 <Bosmon> https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5333
2015-12-18T00:33:28 <Bosmon> https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5592
2015-12-18T00:34:19 <Bosmon> Actually 5592 suggests that this issue should be solved already
2015-12-18T00:34:21 <cindyli> very relevant indeed
2015-12-18T00:34:29 <Bosmon> I see that you merged in the fix yourself : P
2015-12-18T00:34:49 <Bosmon> cindyli - it would be useful if you could create a branch with the current state of your work so I can investigate it later
2015-12-18T00:35:00 <Bosmon> In the meantime you can apply the "isDestroyed" workaround
2015-12-18T00:35:35 <Bosmon> And https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5578 has some more wandering strategic thinking
2015-12-18T00:36:06 <Bosmon> The more time passes, the more I am convinced that we should just implement UNIVERSAL ABORTABILITY
2015-12-18T00:36:35 <Bosmon> Although this requires some improvements to our promises implementation as well - since these are being used more and more, they are yet another source of "potentially abortable behaviour"
2015-12-18T00:37:33 <Bosmon> YOu will notice that whilst some promises libraries support "cancellation" or "aborting", this is not standard or widespread: https://esdiscuss.org/topic/cancelable-promises
2015-12-18T00:38:03 <Bosmon> So in your case the ideal would be for the underlying AJAX request to be cancelled as well - that is, whilst it is still in-flight, to ensure it never resolves
2015-12-18T00:38:04 <cindyli> i\'m reading the fix merged to resolve 5592
2015-12-18T00:38:12 <Bosmon> Which our future framework will also support : P
2015-12-18T00:39:32 <Bosmon> cindyli - here you can see an example of this kind of workaround in the main GPII:
2015-12-18T00:39:32 <Bosmon> https://github.com/amb26/universal/blob/GPII-1318/gpii/node_modules/deviceReporter/src/DeviceReporter.js#L107
2015-12-18T00:39:54 <Bosmon> It\'s probably the simplest and most direct solution but it is a bit of a mess
2015-12-18T00:40:24 <Bosmon> Ah wow, here we go - this is the JIRA for NULLABLE PROMISES:
2015-12-18T00:40:25 <Bosmon> https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5790
2015-12-18T00:42:26 <cindyli> NULLABLE PROMISE is a very cool idea
2015-12-18T00:42:51 <cindyli> so, for now, i only set the model value if the component itself hasn\'t been destroyed
2015-12-18T00:43:06 <cindyli> trying...
2015-12-18T00:43:10 <cindyli> what time is it over there

2015-12-18T01:05:18 <cindyli> certainly. will do, Bosmon

2015-12-18T01:05:49 <Bosmon> cindyli - awesome
2015-12-18T01:05:50 <cindyli> and continue...
2015-12-18T01:05:56 <Bosmon> Did the workaround manage to resolve your immediate problem?
2015-12-18T01:07:00 <cindyli> not for now. i added the workaround to the ajax that i thought causing the problem. but still have the error reported
2015-12-18T01:07:08 <cindyli> of course, i have more than one ajax calls
2015-12-18T01:07:20 <cindyli> will continue to play with it
2015-12-18T01:07:34 <cindyli> you better go to bed
2015-12-18T01:07:44 <Bosmon> cindyli - what are your AJAX calls fetching?
2015-12-18T01:07:57 <Bosmon> Are you still working on the privacy UI for review4?
2015-12-18T01:08:04 <Bosmon> I wonder if you managed to contact kasparnet today
2015-12-18T01:08:06 <cindyli> it fetches available preference sets
2015-12-18T01:08:32 <cindyli> no, i didn\'t contact kasper afterwards
2015-12-18T01:08:42 <cindyli> will do it tomorrow

2015-12-18T01:38:45 <Bosmon> cindyli - cool, glad we can have at least some kind of fix

2015-12-18T15:06:36 <Justin_o> anastasiac: thanks
2015-12-18T15:06:45 <anastasiac> the code was merged, right Justin_o?
2015-12-18T15:07:04 <Justin_o> anastasiac: i made a change to the table, but it\'s still a bit large, let me know if you have some more suggestions on it..
2015-12-18T15:07:10 <Justin_o> anastasiac: yes, the code was merged
2015-12-18T15:07:15 <Justin_o> last night
2015-12-18T15:14:44 <bens__> anastasiac, Justin_o, regarding updating the infusion version in the first discovery tool: it looks like a custom build of infusion is bundled with the FDT at https://github.com/GPII/first-discovery/tree/master/src/lib/infusion. In order to upgrade I think we need to create a new infusion package using the instructions at https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion. And the custom build options for the First Discovery Tool\'s infusion package are documented a
2015-12-18T15:14:44 <bens__> t https://github.com/GPII/first-discovery/blob/master/src/lib/infusion/VERSION.md
2015-12-18T15:15:14 <Justin_o> bens__: yes, that\'s correct
2015-12-18T15:16:43 <Justin_o> bens__: the VERSION.md file isn\'t generated by the Infusion build, so you\'ll want to keep that and update it as necessary (probably just the commit hash)
2015-12-18T15:20:56 <bens__> good to know. there is also the testing framework from infusion at tests/lib/infusion that needs to be updated.. that looks like more of a file copy rather than building an infusion package
2015-12-18T15:30:57 <bens__> all, we\'re going to have a short demo at the end of our PGA stand up today. The demo will include instances of a First Discovery Tool (not server) and a Preferences Editor talking with a docker-preferences-server container group which uses a Cloudant service in place of CouchDB. If you\'re interested, the demo will start around 12:10 PM EST and you can join via Zoom at https://zoom.us/j/3935010675
2015-12-18T15:36:07 <Justin_o> bens__: yes, the tests are a file copy. The tests are not included in custom builds.
2015-12-18T15:38:11 <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: ^^
2015-12-18T15:38:28 <Justin_o> bens__: thanks for the invite, I\'m working short day today, but i\'ll try to make it.
2015-12-18T15:38:38 <bens__> Justin_o: so its essentially for any file at https://github.com/GPII/first-discovery/tree/master/tests/lib/infusion, overwrite it with the same file from https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/tree/master/tests
2015-12-18T15:38:47 <gtirloni> bens__: thanks! will be there
2015-12-18T15:39:48 <alanharnum> bens__: thanks - i should be able to pop in.
2015-12-18T15:40:33 <Justin_o> bens__: yes, pretty much. I usually delete all the old ones to make sure that if something was removed it doesn\'t linger. Usually there aren\'t too many changes though. so you might find that there is nothing different

2015-12-18T15:55:17 <anastasiac> Justin_o: regarding that table in the FD server docs. I think the table will fit a lot better if the env var itself is included either in the option path column or in the description column. I tried mocking it up in the description column, and it looks pretty reasonable.
2015-12-18T16:00:57 <anastasiac> Justin_o: did you deploy your GPII-1337 docs branch to your github io?

2015-12-18T17:14:52 <alanharnum> so along with configuring cloudBasedUrls, need to configure authServerUrls.preferencesPost
