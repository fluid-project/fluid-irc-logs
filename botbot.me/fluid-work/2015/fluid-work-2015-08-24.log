b'2015-08-24T19:24:18 <colinclark> anastasiac: I\'ll read your tutorial today :)
2015-08-24T19:24:31 <colinclark> since alanharnum and Justin_o seem to have slacked out on you
2015-08-24T19:24:33 <kasparnet> Bosmon: cheers, Antranig, I\'ll give it some thought and do so if I come up with something
2015-08-24T19:25:03 <kasparnet> Bosmon: ok - I\'ll try and cook some food now... thanks again for the help, and tty tomorrow
2015-08-24T19:26:27 <Bosmon> kasparnet - cheers, until that DAY DAWNING

2015-08-24T19:36:45 <colinclark> hey avtar and sepidehshahi, you might be interested in this link I found in the meeting notes for last week\'s P4A Developer Space meeting
2015-08-24T19:36:49 <colinclark> which sadly I wasn\'t able to attend
2015-08-24T19:36:59 <colinclark> but avtar, you might want to pencil it into your calendar going forward
2015-08-24T19:37:04 <colinclark> https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0Bxy2B0Y99qCufk0xZ3ZWMEJlWUo2ZGs4MGg1a2Fld3JSY1pSUWw1ekVza1A4OTlKLTJaaFU
2015-08-24T19:37:35 <colinclark> If I understand it correctly, sepidehshahi and avtar, this Google Drive folder contains the latest working designs for the Developer Space
2015-08-24T19:39:27 <sepidehshahi> colinclark: should I include the dashboard wireframes in here? I was going to ask avtar about the best place to publish them. Michelle suggested putting them on GPII Wiki
2015-08-24T19:39:49 <colinclark> I think we should probably schedule some time to talk with Till and Nadia first
2015-08-24T19:40:00 <sepidehshahi> sure
2015-08-24T19:40:01 <colinclark> or attend the next Developer Space meeting to describe what we\'re doing with the Dashboard and what kinds of things we need
2015-08-24T19:40:08 * avtar has quit
2015-08-24T19:40:11 <colinclark> and present our designs as "suggestions"
2015-08-24T19:40:12 <colinclark> ;)
2015-08-24T19:40:18 <sepidehshahi> ok
2015-08-24T19:40:56 <colinclark> perhaps we should put our designs into a comic font
2015-08-24T19:41:15 <colinclark> for a consistent look and feel
2015-08-24T19:41:55 <colinclark> I\'m not serious, for the record

b'2015-08-24T14:42:26 <Justin_o> alanharnum:  didn\'t work, even with a restart of the computer :(
2015-08-24T14:42:36 <alanharnum> still using old IP?
2015-08-24T14:42:54 <Justin_o> alanharnum: yes, still 205.211.169.202
2015-08-24T14:43:11 <Justin_o> i wonder if i\'m using a different DNS server or something, that wasn\'t updated
2015-08-24T14:45:27 <gtirloni_> Justin_o, can you try `dig wiki.fluidproject.org` and paste the results? (pastebin.org)
2015-08-24T14:46:27 <gtirloni_> also, `cat /private/etc/hosts`
2015-08-24T14:46:32 <Justin_o> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/hjrnkrk7/
2015-08-24T14:47:07 <Justin_o> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/Wg09C84q/
2015-08-24T14:47:14 <Justin_o> so maybe the private hosts is the problem :(
2015-08-24T14:47:18 <gtirloni_> :)
2015-08-24T14:48:23 <Justin_o> alanharnum, gtirloni_: all fixed now, thanks
2015-08-24T14:49:17 <Justin_o> alanharnum, gtirloni_: are you still okay to lead the ansible workshop this week?
2015-08-24T14:50:13 <alanharnum> Justin_o: I feel like a broken record saying "I haven\'t really had time..." :( But I think we could prep something depending on how gtirloni_\'s great migration work is going
2015-08-24T14:52:37 <gtirloni_> yea, that will be okay
2015-08-24T14:53:48 <alanharnum> gtirloni_: maybe we can touch base tomorrow or this afternoon about what we want to do
2015-08-24T14:54:15 <gtirloni_> tomorrow afternoon would be great, if you\'re free
2015-08-24T14:54:49 <alanharnum> gtirloni_: I\'ll make sure I am
2015-08-24T14:54:54 <gtirloni_> cool! thx
2015-08-24T14:56:29 <Justin_o> gtirloni, alanharnum: thanks guys
2015-08-24T14:57:02 <Justin_o> simonjb: i hear that you\'ll need to finish up the Lisp community meeting, do you have an idea of when you\'d like to do that?
2015-08-24T14:57:15 <Justin_o> we are currently wide open after this week

2015-08-24T15:59:53 <kasparnet> so I\'m back to the preferences server work
2015-08-24T16:00:24 <kasparnet> and been trying the distributeOptions the datasource\'s error handler
2015-08-24T16:01:03 <kasparnet> but I cant for the life of me manage to find it, replace it, etc.. nothing I do seem to have any effect
2015-08-24T16:04:05 <kasparnet> (sorry for being a bit slow on this)
2015-08-24T16:18:39 <kasparnet> ... speaking of broken server... anyone else is having trouble with the GPII wiki: https://issues.gpii.net/
2015-08-24T16:20:58 <gtirloni> it\'s down. i\'m trying to find what\'s wrong with it
2015-08-24T16:27:48 <gtirloni> it\'s back.. issue with ssl cert validation coming from tomcat

2015-08-24T17:05:21 <anastasiac> colinclark and alanharnum, I\xe2\x80\x99d really appreciate your thoughts on the direction that the Preferences Framework Tutorial is going (I\xe2\x80\x99ve shared the google doc with you both)
2015-08-24T17:05:42 <colinclark> totally, I will look at it today, anastasiac
2015-08-24T17:05:43 <anastasiac> It\xe2\x80\x99s still early, but I\xe2\x80\x99d reather have your input on the general approach and direction sooner than later
2015-08-24T17:06:12 <anastasiac> kaye has provided some thougths, but I think a developer like alanharnum is closer to our target audience than a newbie like kaye
2015-08-24T17:07:08 <anastasiac> Justin_o: any thoughts you have on the FD Tool tutorial would also be welcome
2015-08-24T17:12:05 * yzen has quit
2015-08-24T17:17:19 <anastasiac> colinclark: are there any \xe2\x80\x9cGPII services for speech\xe2\x80\x9d?
2015-08-24T17:17:32 <colinclark> no
2015-08-24T17:17:36 <colinclark> this sounds like Rich-speak to me :P
2015-08-24T17:17:39 <colinclark> There\'s the TTS enactor
2015-08-24T17:17:43 <colinclark> which arguably fits the bill just fine
2015-08-24T17:17:58 <colinclark> But that expression reminds me of old Service Oriented Architecture thinking
2015-08-24T17:18:01 <anastasiac> LOL indeed, it is rich-speak
2015-08-24T17:18:07 <colinclark> which was still big at IBM even a couple years ago
2015-08-24T17:18:20 <colinclark> So, I change my answer
2015-08-24T17:18:33 <colinclark> "Yes, there is the browser-based GPII speech service"
2015-08-24T17:19:35 <colinclark> The source code for it is located right here: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/preferences/js/SelfVoicingEnactor.js
2015-08-24T17:19:45 <anastasiac> yes, that I konw

2015-08-24T17:47:35 <kasparnet> Bosmon: hey there
2015-08-24T17:47:46 <Bosmon> kasparnet - how are you getting on?
2015-08-24T17:47:46 <kasparnet> sorry for all my questions on this stuff
2015-08-24T17:47:52 <Bosmon> Sorry to be out, I had a lot of errands to do today
2015-08-24T17:48:03 <kasparnet> no worries at all
2015-08-24T17:48:32 <Bosmon> Did you verify that that error handler in dataSource is indeed the one that is executing?
2015-08-24T17:48:33 <kasparnet> I got a ton of tasks i switch between, so no problem
2015-08-24T17:48:38 <kasparnet> yeah, I did
2015-08-24T17:48:54 <Bosmon> OK, that\'s cool - and so it looks like what is screwing up your error handling with the "unknown error" response?
2015-08-24T17:48:57 <kasparnet> removing it from the kettle made the tests pass properly
2015-08-24T17:49:01 <Bosmon> Excellent
2015-08-24T17:49:12 <Bosmon> Ok, so we just need to construct the right distributeOptions block
2015-08-24T17:49:16 <Bosmon> What have you tried writing?
2015-08-24T17:49:20 <kasparnet> yup
2015-08-24T17:49:22 * yzen joined the channel
2015-08-24T17:49:26 <kasparnet> everything :)
2015-08-24T17:49:31 <Bosmon> Speak of the devil :)
2015-08-24T17:49:37 <Bosmon> Well, I doubt you have in fact tried EVERYTHING : P
2015-08-24T17:49:44 <kasparnet> haha, I do too
2015-08-24T17:49:50 <Bosmon> I hope that when you set about destroying humanity you will be more thorough about it than this
2015-08-24T17:50:02 <Bosmon> Otherwise I suspect that countless millions may end up slipping through the net
2015-08-24T17:50:37 <Bosmon> Even if you boast a 99.9% success rate :)
2015-08-24T17:51:01 <kasparnet> well - in some ways that wouldn\'t be too bad... It would almost be a shame to destroy the planet and not leave anyone to be horrified by my evil deeds
2015-08-24T17:51:36 <kasparnet> ... A little resistance movement of survivers that I can then slowly crush
2015-08-24T17:53:04 <Bosmon> kasparnet - ok, paste me some stuff when you get a moment
2015-08-24T17:55:15 <Justin_o> anastasiac: i have a  todo for looking at the FD tutorials
2015-08-24T17:55:25 <Justin_o> I probably won\'t have a chance to look at them today though
2015-08-24T17:59:19 <kasparnet> Bosmon: well, so this one is about a quarter into desparate attempts https://gist.github.com/kaspermarkus/c9701d9935543fccea2a#file-js-L111-L112 :)
2015-08-24T17:59:28 <kasparnet> desperate*
2015-08-24T18:01:07 <kasparnet> I ended up sidetracking a bit, cause I wasn\'t really able to get the system to react to my distribute options
2015-08-24T18:01:10 * danayo joined the channel
2015-08-24T18:01:20 <kasparnet> in the beginning I was putting them in the config file
2015-08-24T18:11:53 <kasparnet> I also tried much the same with "deviceReporterDataSource" but with no success
2015-08-24T18:19:12 * michelled joined the channel
2015-08-24T18:36:38 <Bosmon> kasparnet - ok, so where\'s the "myErrBack"?
2015-08-24T18:36:58 <Bosmon> Anyway, you can\'t just distribute entire components like that...
2015-08-24T18:37:14 <Bosmon> What do you think that even means? : P
2015-08-24T18:40:16 <Bosmon> kasparnet - try this:
2015-08-24T18:40:17 <Bosmon> http://piratepad.net/gTIVCrK8Z6
2015-08-24T18:40:31 <Bosmon> anyway, I don\'t think you want the errBack at all, you just want it abolished

2015-08-24T19:07:00 <Bosmon> Oh sorry, I did
2015-08-24T19:07:13 <Bosmon> But I\'m sure you knew there was nothing in the system called "dataSourceErrBack" : P
2015-08-24T19:12:08 <kasparnet> Bosmon: yeah, sorry - I did try both "{that dataSource errBack}.type" and "{that dataSource}.errBack.type"
2015-08-24T19:12:15 <kasparnet> but no luck
2015-08-24T19:12:40 <Bosmon> kasparnet - ok, check it in and let me try it out
2015-08-24T19:13:28 <Bosmon> kasparnet WAIT
2015-08-24T19:13:31 <Bosmon> I made a further typo
2015-08-24T19:13:38 <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/blob/master/lib/dataSource.js#L126
2015-08-24T19:13:42 <Bosmon> It\'s actually called "errback"
2015-08-24T19:20:16 <colinclark> errback is so not a word
2015-08-24T19:20:32 <colinclark> though I have been to Erbach in the Rheingau
2015-08-24T19:20:34 <colinclark> very nice town
2015-08-24T19:21:08 <kasparnet> Bosmon: shit - nice catch -- I should\'ve seen that
2015-08-24T19:21:20 <kasparnet> and that definitely did something
2015-08-24T19:21:24 <kasparnet> now my test is stalling
2015-08-24T19:21:25 <alanharnum> anastasiac: is it OK if I look at your document tomorrow? trying to crank through the evaluation
2015-08-24T19:21:37 <kasparnet> but that I should be able to figure out
2015-08-24T19:21:53 <Bosmon> kasparnet - cool - it looks like we\'ve managed to eliminate the handler at least
2015-08-24T19:22:16 <kasparnet> Bosmon: yup!
2015-08-24T19:22:20 <kasparnet> thanks so much for your help on this
2015-08-24T19:22:27 <Bosmon> kasparnet - no worries
2015-08-24T19:22:31 <anastasiac> yes, of course, alanharnum, whenever you have a chance
2015-08-24T19:22:49 <kasparnet> lol colinclark - totally agree... And yet, it gives 45,000 hits on The Gugle
2015-08-24T19:23:08 <Bosmon> kasparnet - if there\'s something about Infusion that you think it would be great to have explained that would have made it easier to figure out how to resolve this, please do make a sketch or something
2015-08-24T19:23:27 <Bosmon> I know our docs aren\'t the greatest, but a big reason for this is that we\'re not entirely sure what to write about

2015-08-24T12:08:52 <kasparnet> Hello Mr. bosmon
2015-08-24T12:09:01 <Bosmon> NITT!
2015-08-24T12:09:51 <kasparnet> damn -- no wonder I miss your responses when you answer that lightning quick
2015-08-24T12:09:56 <kasparnet> ZOOOOOM!!!!
2015-08-24T12:10:20 <kasparnet> sorry for dissapearing on friday after my ping
2015-08-24T12:10:27 <kasparnet> disappearing, even
2015-08-24T12:11:19 <kasparnet> So my preferences server test is pretty much ready (ie. proper error messages)
2015-08-24T12:11:54 <kasparnet> only thing I\'d like to improve is that the error message i send is actually sent back
2015-08-24T12:12:23 <kasparnet> but somewhere along the return path it\'s eaten (by God knows what) and changed to a "Unknown Error"
2015-08-24T12:13:52 <Bosmon> aha
2015-08-24T12:13:58 <Bosmon> How are you throwing it
2015-08-24T12:15:48 <Bosmon> Well, if you can check it in and show me the site it is being thrown, and what I can do to trigger it, I can take a look
2015-08-24T12:15:59 <Bosmon> I expect I\'ll hear from you again in a few days or weeks : P
2015-08-24T12:17:17 <kasparnet> hehe
2015-08-24T12:17:21 <kasparnet> was just pushing stuff
2015-08-24T12:17:54 <kasparnet> let me just find some line numbers
2015-08-24T12:21:11 <kasparnet> Bosmon: so this is the error that doesn\'t get passed back properly: https://github.com/kaspermarkus/universal/blob/GPII-1227/gpii/node_modules/rawPreferencesServer/src/rawPreferencesGet.js#L48
2015-08-24T12:21:27 <kasparnet> Bosmon: the one above (line 40) works just fine
2015-08-24T12:21:59 <kasparnet> I even think I tried passing the error back via the same method as line 44, and it still didn\'t work
2015-08-24T12:24:52 * Justin_o joined the channel
2015-08-24T12:36:37 <kasparnet> Bosmon: hmm... could this be some kettle thing, where it besides rejecting the promise also itself sends an error?
2015-08-24T12:36:48 <kasparnet> (ie. fails the requestProxy or something)
2015-08-24T12:38:48 * kasparnet is looking through the kettle code
2015-08-24T12:40:44 * jhung joined the channel
2015-08-24T12:45:39 <Bosmon> kasparnet - yes, for a start, you should stop using the requestProxy
2015-08-24T12:45:45 <Bosmon> You may recall that we\'re trying to abolish it
2015-08-24T12:47:06 <Bosmon> Still, what should happen is that this handler is triggered - which shouldn\'t produce "unknownError"
2015-08-24T12:47:07 <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/blob/master/lib/request.js#L209
2015-08-24T12:48:21 <Bosmon> So is the error gone by the time you get to this point? https://github.com/kaspermarkus/universal/blob/GPII-1227/gpii/node_modules/preferencesServer/src/preferencesGetHandler.js#L50
2015-08-24T12:48:42 <kasparnet> sec
2015-08-24T12:51:29 * slim_ has quit
2015-08-24T12:51:55 <kasparnet> Bosmon: yes, even by the time I get to this point: https://github.com/kaspermarkus/universal/blob/GPII-1227/gpii/node_modules/preferencesServer/src/preferencesServer.js#L105
2015-08-24T12:52:41 <kasparnet> which I dont know whether should be a sign of something wrong (it being in the promises \'then\' section)
2015-08-24T12:52:58 <kasparnet> just checking that request.js kettle line as well
2015-08-24T12:54:33 <kasparnet> ah - you found it Bosmon
2015-08-24T12:54:39 <kasparnet> it was in that lib/request.js line
2015-08-24T12:55:23 <kasparnet> it seems that its some Javascript weirdness
2015-08-24T12:55:27 <Bosmon> What?
2015-08-24T12:55:45 <kasparnet> inspecting the \'error\' object that gets sent to that kettle function
2015-08-24T12:56:53 <Bosmon> What about it!
2015-08-24T12:56:58 <kasparnet> ugh... cant paste screenshot here
2015-08-24T12:57:02 <kasparnet> error: SyntaxError: Unexpected string

2015-08-24T12:57:26 <kasparnet> ok... let me try and reformat that
2015-08-24T12:57:28 <Bosmon> SyntaxError!
2015-08-24T12:57:36 <Bosmon> Well, you must have made one somewhere
2015-08-24T12:57:41 <Bosmon> Have you tried linting your code?
2015-08-24T12:57:43 <kasparnet> error: SyntaxError: Unexpected string

2015-08-24T12:57:51 <Bosmon> Yes
2015-08-24T12:57:51 <kasparnet> isError: true
2015-08-24T12:57:53 <kasparnet> __proto__: Object
2015-08-24T12:57:54 <Bosmon> Have you linted?
2015-08-24T12:57:55 <kasparnet> Bosmon: sorry - I should have said that
2015-08-24T12:58:00 <kasparnet> this is a test for malformed JSON
2015-08-24T12:58:04 <Bosmon> ah
2015-08-24T12:58:09 <Bosmon> ok
2015-08-24T12:58:13 <kasparnet> but I still wanted to pass the error message back
2015-08-24T12:58:29 <kasparnet> saying that it\'s invalid syntax - to make debugging easier
2015-08-24T12:58:54 <Bosmon> I think what\'s happening is that you are running into another piece of JURAISM
2015-08-24T12:59:04 <kasparnet> ok
2015-08-24T12:59:15 <Bosmon> Which I also just abolished in NEW KETTLE recently...
2015-08-24T12:59:23 <kasparnet> awesome!
2015-08-24T12:59:35 <Bosmon> So take a look at this: https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/blob/master/lib/dataSource.js#L127
2015-08-24T12:59:56 <Bosmon> THis is attached to every dataSource, and eventually fires to here: https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/blob/master/lib/dataSource.js#L259
2015-08-24T13:00:06 <Bosmon> So my suspicion is that this error handler is probably firing just before yours
2015-08-24T13:00:12 <Bosmon> Try putting some logging in there to see if it is
2015-08-24T13:00:22 <kasparnet> yup, will do!
2015-08-24T13:00:25 <Bosmon> IN general the best thing to do would be to just remove this error handler entirely
2015-08-24T13:00:39 <Bosmon> Simplest way to do that would be to just write a distributeOptions that obliterates it with "fluid.identity" for now
2015-08-24T13:01:14 <Bosmon> Well, you can either obliterate the "handleError" function or you can obliterate the errBack component entirely
2015-08-24T13:02:04 <kasparnet> cool, that makes sense
2015-08-24T13:02:40 <kasparnet> Would it be preferable to do it in the testcase, or as a general thing in the config?
2015-08-24T13:02:51 <kasparnet> (ie. will it destroy things if I put it in the config?)

2015-08-24T13:23:20 <Bosmon> kasparne_ - would be best to just to it globally throughout the GPII :)
2015-08-24T13:23:31 <Bosmon> There might be a couple of places relying on it, but it should be easy enough to fix up
2015-08-24T13:23:31 <kasparne_> ok
2015-08-24T13:23:40 <kasparne_> yup
2015-08-24T13:23:43 <Bosmon> Especially as it seems that the error handler it applies is so fucked anyway
2015-08-24T13:23:47 <Bosmon> Did you discover that this was indeed the problem?
2015-08-24T13:24:02 <Bosmon> I can\'t believe it was actually some "JavaScript" weirdness that was the issue instead : P
2015-08-24T13:25:08 <kasparne_> yeah - uncommenting that line https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/blob/master/lib/dataSource.js#L259 - and everything works
2015-08-24T13:41:31 * yzen joined the channel
2015-08-24T13:42:27 <kasparne_> Bosmon: ok - a bit of a basic question here... what would my reference in the target block of distribute options be (ie. to catch DataSource)
2015-08-24T13:42:54 <kasparne_> ie. where is it located in the tree -- and how would I best find out if I didn\'t have an all knowing bosmon around the corner
2015-08-24T13:46:11 * slim___ joined the channel
2015-08-24T13:47:49 * slim_ has quit
2015-08-24T13:47:54 * clown joined the channel
2015-08-24T13:49:35 <Bosmon> kasparne_ - it\'s everywhere where there is a dataSource
2015-08-24T13:49:48 <Bosmon> So I imagine you\'d just target {that dataSource errBack}
2015-08-24T13:50:18 * alanharnum joined the channel
2015-08-24T13:52:10 <kasparne_> Bosmon: yeah ok.. I\'ll try that out

2015-08-24T14:18:22 <alanharnum> Justin_o: seems OK for me - is there a particular page giving you an issue?
2015-08-24T14:19:19 <Justin_o> alanharnum: https://wiki.fluidproject.org
2015-08-24T14:19:24 <Justin_o> that\'s not working for me
2015-08-24T14:19:50 <Justin_o> i\'ve tried safari, chrome, and firefox
2015-08-24T14:20:11 <alanharnum> Justin_o: what do you get for IP if you ping wiki.fluidproject.org?
2015-08-24T14:20:19 * gtirloni_ joined the channel
2015-08-24T14:20:21 <michelled> alanharnum, anastasiac, danayo, jhung, Justin_o, murilocrivellari, simonjb: can we do the floe meeting after stand-up today?
2015-08-24T14:20:29 <alanharnum> michelled: that works for me
2015-08-24T14:20:34 <jhung> sure michelled
2015-08-24T14:20:35 <anastasiac> sure
2015-08-24T14:21:02 <murilocrivellari> michelled: works for me
2015-08-24T14:21:22 <simonjb> michelled: good for me
2015-08-24T14:22:59 <alanharnum> Justin_o: it works for me & I think the IP may have changed lately due to gtirloni\'s migration work - it\'s possible you\'re caching the old IP or somesuch
2015-08-24T14:23:18 <alanharnum> (well, not you specifically, but your computer)
2015-08-24T14:24:06 <alanharnum> Justin_o: do you get 205.211.169.34 as the IP if you ping wiki.fluidproject.org from CLI?
2015-08-24T14:24:55 <Justin_o> alanharnum: no, i\'m getting 205.211.169.202
2015-08-24T14:24:58 <Justin_o> so i guess you\'re right
2015-08-24T14:25:13 <Justin_o> this is why i shouldn\'t take vacation :(
2015-08-24T14:25:56 <alanharnum> try resetting the DNS cache

2015-08-24T14:26:23 <alanharnum> I\'ve had more problems with OSX caching old DNS entries in the name of being "helpful" than any other system I\'ve dealt with :P
2015-08-24T14:38:52 <danayo> michelled: I can do that
