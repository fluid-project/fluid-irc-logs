2015-03-27T13:24:03 <cindyli> sure, Justin_o
2015-03-27T13:24:10 <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks
2015-03-27T13:24:15 <cindyli> np
2015-03-27T13:26:36 <Justin_o> michelled, anastasiac: does the floe iteration page still need to be sorted by priority http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Floe+Iteration+Plan
2015-03-27T13:26:51 <michelled> yeah
2015-03-27T13:26:58 <michelled> are you looking for something to work on?
2015-03-27T13:27:25 <Justin_o> michelled: yes.. i just filed a couple pulls for FLOE-280.
2015-03-27T13:27:50 <Justin_o> i could probably connect the turn voice on/off button with the speak text panel if it\'s confirmed that we want that
2015-03-27T13:28:16 <michelled> language and self voicing were the highest priority for now
2015-03-27T13:28:23 <michelled> so that seems fine
2015-03-27T13:28:34 <michelled> I should have a prioritized list for you today
2015-03-27T13:29:09 <Justin_o> michelled: i\'m not sure how much of the language we can do till after the updates to the prefsFramework
2015-03-27T13:29:16 <Justin_o> and the localized strings
2015-03-27T13:30:45 <michelled> Justin_o:  the congratulations page was high priority too
2015-03-27T13:31:27 <Justin_o> michelled: ah okay.. i\'ll look at that
2015-03-27T13:31:36 <michelled> thx
2015-03-27T13:31:38 <Justin_o> michelled: do you mean confirmation page?
2015-03-27T13:31:57 <michelled> well, I meant the congratulations page - is that done already?
2015-03-27T13:32:38 <Justin_o> michelled: no not yet, but not sure you could even get to it without the confirmation page
2015-03-27T13:33:37 <michelled> well, the reason I\'m not prioritizing the confirmation page is because of the estimate
2015-03-27T13:33:46 <michelled> but we do want something to finish with
2015-03-27T13:34:13 <Justin_o> michelled: okay, do you remember if we have designs for the congratulations page
2015-03-27T13:34:37 <michelled> yes, we estimated those off the original designs
2015-03-27T13:35:42 <anastasiac> Justin_o: https://www.dropbox.com/s/red3sn7g88o1q4a/First%20Discovery%20January%2021%2015.pdf?dl=0 about page 8
2015-03-27T13:36:23 <Justin_o> michelled: thanks i just found it on the January 29 wireframes too..
2015-03-27T13:36:56 <anastasiac> oh, even better. I wonder why danaayotte didn\xe2\x80\x99t put those in the iteration page\xe2\x80\xa6

2015-03-27T13:45:42 <michelled> can\'t show it
2015-03-27T13:51:26 <jhung> simonjb: do you have time this morning to talk about infusion documentation?

2015-03-27T14:41:24 <cindyli> thanks
2015-03-27T14:47:40 <Justin_o> cindyli: the pull request is ready for another round of review

2015-03-27T14:48:10 <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks
2015-03-27T14:48:21 <cindyli> np
2015-03-27T14:58:06 <Justin_o> cindyli: are you having any problems with github?
2015-03-27T14:58:17 <cindyli> no, Justin_o
2015-03-27T14:58:40 <cindyli> your first pull for 280 has been merged, can you update the 2nd pull, Justin_o
2015-03-27T14:58:46 <Justin_o> i\'ve been getting timeouts here and then when trying to fetch and push
2015-03-27T14:58:47 <avtar> Justin_o: github was experiencing a ddos
2015-03-27T14:58:59 <Justin_o> avtar: ah that\'s why
2015-03-27T14:59:04 <avtar> https://status.github.com/
2015-03-27T14:59:24 <Justin_o> why do people do that?
2015-03-27T14:59:57 <avtar> for profit and to enforce belief systems would be my top guesses
2015-03-27T15:01:08 <Justin_o> hmm
2015-03-27T15:01:11 <avtar> and perhaps to impress fellow script kiddie friends
2015-03-27T15:01:20 <avtar> i\'ve run of out possible reasons
2015-03-27T15:01:52 <Justin_o> those all seem reasonable though
2015-03-27T15:02:04 <avtar> :)
2015-03-27T15:03:15 <Justin_o> cindyli: the FLOE-280 pull request has been updated with master
2015-03-27T15:03:33 <cindyli> cool. thanks, Justin_o
2015-03-27T15:03:38 <Bosmon> You missed the final reason

2015-03-27T16:34:47 <michelled> I\'m still waiting to hear from Jess__ and colinclark about what we should prioritize.
2015-03-27T16:35:10 <Jess__> michelled: um...
2015-03-27T16:45:29 <Justin_o> michelled: i think it generally looks good, wondering why contrast is lower on the page because the adjuster is there already
2015-03-27T16:45:49 <michelled> it doesn\'t work well in Windows
2015-03-27T16:45:56 <michelled> it\'s very buggy - so it won\'t show well

2015-03-27T17:38:12 <Justin_o> ?
2015-03-27T17:39:03 <jhung> Justin_o: yes. What\'s up?
2015-03-27T17:39:22 <Justin_o> jhung: for the congratulations page we need an "X"
2015-03-27T17:39:33 <Justin_o> http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLOE-294
2015-03-27T17:39:40 <Justin_o> the wireframes are linked to that jira
2015-03-27T17:39:59 <Justin_o> would you be able to add that to the existing icon font we have
2015-03-27T17:40:50 <jhung> sorry Justin_o I was thinking exploration tool. I Dana did the font icon for first discovery
2015-03-27T17:41:05 <Justin_o> jhung: oh okay
2015-03-27T17:41:13 <Justin_o> i guess i can ask her about it on monday then
2015-03-27T17:41:18 <Justin_o> i\'ll just get the rest done for now
