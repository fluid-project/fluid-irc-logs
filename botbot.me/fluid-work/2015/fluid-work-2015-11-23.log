2015-11-23T15:52:29 <michelled> it will allow Lisa to join us more frequently
2015-11-23T15:52:50 <colinclark> I'm fine with it, but are other people also ok with it?

2015-11-23T19:54:04 <anastasiac> cindyli: I had a look at your FD Tool prefs server integration docs and left a couple of comments  https://github.com/acheetham/docs-first-discovery/pull/2
2015-11-23T19:54:24 <cindyli> thanks, anastasiac. working on them
2015-11-23T19:54:47 <anastasiac> great diagram, cindyli
2015-11-23T19:55:28 <cindyli> anastasiac: sepidehshahi helped me :)
2015-11-23T19:55:43 <sepidehshahi> ;)
2015-11-23T19:55:45 <anastasiac> well, nice work, both of you :-0
2015-11-23T19:56:54 <cindyli> anastasiac: one question, when i move the diagram file from src/documents/images/ to src/static/images/, does the path used in the doc to refer to this diagram need to be changed? it currently points to images/GPII-Preferences-Server-Integration.svg
2015-11-23T19:57:18 <anastasiac> no, cindyli, that\xe2\x80\x99s where the image will end up after the docpad deployment
2015-11-23T19:57:34 <cindyli> cool. thanks
2015-11-23T19:59:19 <cindyli> anastasiac: comments addressed. ready for another look
2015-11-23T19:59:32 <anastasiac> k
2015-11-23T20:01:11 <cindyli> anastasiac: one sec, i didn't fix the shadow under the prefs server box. let me see if that can be fixed. will let you know
2015-11-23T20:01:21 <anastasiac> k
2015-11-23T20:03:36 <anastasiac> cindyli: I would suggest moving the diagram to before the \xe2\x80\x9cnote\xe2\x80\x9d
2015-11-23T20:03:40 <anastasiac> now that I look at it...
2015-11-23T20:03:45 <cindyli> ok
2015-11-23T20:05:04 <anastasiac> cindyli: I take that back. It would actually probably go best in the next section, after the \xe2\x80\x9cwhat it does\xe2\x80\x9d list, since those bullet points correspond well to the diagram
2015-11-23T20:05:20 <cindyli> ok
2015-11-23T20:05:29 <anastasiac> sorry about that :-)
2015-11-23T20:07:53 <cindyli> no apologies, anastasiac. it's great that you help to polish up the wording and the doc structure. the pull request is ready again. thanks.
2015-11-23T20:08:05 <anastasiac> k
2015-11-23T20:09:45 <anastasiac> cindyli: what did you use to create the image? It seems to have a very large white space around it\xe2\x80\xa6
2015-11-23T20:09:54 <anastasiac> it didin\xe2\x80\x99t look that way before
2015-11-23T20:11:27 <cindyli> i used OmniGraffle and exported .graffle file to .svg. probably because i chose to export the whole cavas. it fixes the shadow issue but adds the white space around, anastasiac
