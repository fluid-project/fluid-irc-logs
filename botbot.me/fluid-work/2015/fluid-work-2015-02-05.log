b'2015-02-05T21:44:17 <simonjb> which we still need a name for
2015-02-05T21:45:29 <jhung> Sepideh: I took a look at the hand-out\xe2\x80\xa6. wow! Looking awesome!
2015-02-05T21:46:01 <Sepideh> thanks jhung:)
2015-02-05T21:46:04 <simonjb> Bosmon7: actually, are you around for a bit? Michelle and I\'d like to chat the 3 of us?
2015-02-05T21:46:10 <Bosmon7> simonjb - I guess this is unavoidably a design decision
2015-02-05T21:46:18 <Bosmon7> Since the name of the page will appear in its title
2015-02-05T21:46:29 <Bosmon7> simonjb - yes I could talk for a bit
2015-02-05T21:46:32 <simonjb> Bosmon7: which is "Privacy Settings"
2015-02-05T21:46:41 <Bosmon7> It currently is, yes
2015-02-05T21:46:47 <simonjb> Bosmon7: awesome, in 5 mins?
2015-02-05T21:47:25 <Bosmon7> I do find the title quite uninformative and I imagine that users might as well
2015-02-05T21:47:41 <Bosmon7> Sure
2015-02-05T21:47:47 <simonjb> Bosmon7: I\'ve also got some acceptance tests working and I\'d love to go over them with you -- either today or tomorrow is good too
2015-02-05T21:48:25 <Bosmon7> Cool, I can do that tomorrow
2015-02-05T21:48:36 <simonjb> Bosmon7: the parameterization of the sequence is not quite right but I need your guidance there I think
2015-02-05T21:48:43 <simonjb> tomorrow would be great
2015-02-05T21:48:48 <simonjb> what time?
2015-02-05T21:49:23 * clown has left the channel
2015-02-05T21:50:33 <michelled> I\'m ready now, Bosmon7 and simonjb
2015-02-05T21:50:55 <simonjb> michelled, Bosmon7: skype or vidyo?
2015-02-05T21:51:30 <Bosmon7> simonjb - I can do 9am EST tomorrow
2015-02-05T21:52:00 <simonjb> that would be great, thanks Bosmon7
2015-02-05T21:53:07 <michelled> Bosmon7: is skype or vidyo better for you?
2015-02-05T21:54:17 <Bosmon7> skype a bit easier

2015-02-05T16:58:04 <anastasiac> jhung, regarding the Infusion one-pager: Is it actually supposed to be one page? The text you emailed might have trouble filling a page...
2015-02-05T16:59:40 <jhung> anastasiac: there will also be text about SP3 / Floe\xe2\x80\xa6 and probably visuals.
2015-02-05T16:59:52 <anastasiac> ah, ok. Just checking :-)

2015-02-05T17:13:13 <jhung> yep. I\'ll get to that now Sepideh and anastasiac.
2015-02-05T17:13:20 <anastasiac> ok, let me know if you\xe2\x80\x99d like any help

2015-02-05T18:14:56 <simonjb> Bosmon, Bosmon8, I\'d like to ask you a quick question about renaming the /authorized-services HTML endpoint -- when talking about the actual page we call it the "Privacy Settings" page and that term is used for other associated stuff such as Handlebars templates and Infusion components
2015-02-05T18:15:50 <simonjb> Bosmon, Bosmon8, we came up with "/authorized-services" to differentiate it from the existing "/privacy" page and to offer a better global name within the Flow Manager
2015-02-05T18:16:36 <simonjb> I find the "/authorized-services" name for the Privacy Settings page confusing and I\'d like to rename it to /privacy-settings

2015-02-05T21:36:59 <Bosmon7> Sorry to miss your ping earlier!
2015-02-05T21:37:24 <simonjb> Bosmon7: hey!
2015-02-05T21:37:58 <Bosmon7> Actually I find the name "privacy settings" for the markup page and associated components very confusing : P
2015-02-05T21:38:06 * cindyli has quit
2015-02-05T21:38:25 <Bosmon7> Since I never really know what settings to expect to find on the page, given how generic the name is ....
2015-02-05T21:40:39 <Bosmon7> Also the fact that we have components named "PrivacySettings" and "EditPrivacySettings" adds even further confusion
2015-02-05T21:41:13 <simonjb> Bosmon7: ok, maybe we can come up with another name then, an issue I ran into was that in CloudBasedOauth2.js you use the name AuthorizedServicesRequest for /authorized-services-payload rather than /authorized-services
2015-02-05T21:43:33 <Bosmon7> simonjb - yes - I had been expecting the /authorized-services page to be going away at the time
2015-02-05T21:43:43 <Bosmon7> But I guess it\'s now going away on a much slower schedule
2015-02-05T21:43:49 <Bosmon7> Do feel free to rename the request object
2015-02-05T21:44:09 <simonjb> Bosmon7: but it will be replaced by some other HTML page
