2015-11-25T19:10:38 <michelled> since dspace seems to order by date modified and we are the only ones adding things, it\'s kind of neat to go to the home page right now: http://portal.teco.edu/dspace/
2015-11-25T19:10:51 <anastasiac> yes, so far I\xe2\x80\x99ve just taken text from the Flocking documenation. I noticed the lack of mention about accessibility, and it\xe2\x80\x99s on my to-do list to update the entry. If you have pointers to any writings, colinclark, that would help
2015-11-25T19:11:04 <colinclark> no worries anastasiac
2015-11-25T19:11:08 <colinclark> I\'ll see what I can find
2015-11-25T19:11:31 <colinclark> you\'re undoubtedly well-equipped to write something awesome

2015-11-25T19:13:20 <colinclark> SMALLTALK IS A CARTESIAN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE!
2015-11-25T19:16:28 <simonjb> colinclark: mind and body?
2015-11-25T19:16:33 <colinclark> yes
2015-11-25T19:17:05 <colinclark> "Creative thought (without going into its mechanism) can be viewed as the spontaneous appearance of information in the mind."

2015-11-25T19:18:24 <colinclark> I can imagine that most dancers or painters or even basketball players would disagree with this assertion

2015-11-25T19:19:07 <colinclark> What I like about all this is that it\'s clear their philosophical viewpoint actually fundamentally structured their work
2015-11-25T19:19:32 <colinclark> i.e. ultimately their view of communication and mind/body dualism led them directly to seeing the world as objects and messages
2015-11-25T19:20:44 <simonjb> colinclark: yes, it\'s pretty interesting it itself and I find it also interesting that they articulate that rather than in being implicit as most? computer systems design is
2015-11-25T19:20:55 <colinclark> yes
2015-11-25T19:20:57 <colinclark> exactly
2015-11-25T19:22:01 <colinclark> I think many computer scientists would argue that there is no place such things
2015-11-25T19:24:44 <colinclark> Interestingly, algorithms and other software artefacts didn\'t used to be either copyrightable or patentable
2015-11-25T19:24:58 <colinclark> \xe2\x80\x9cmathematical innovations should be treated like scientific truths and laws of nature, and scientific truths and laws of nature are unpatentable subject matter.\xe2\x80\x9d

2015-11-25T22:03:41 <anastasiac> Justin_o: start with that, and I can start reviewing it there. I\xe2\x80\x99ll probably ask you to file a new one against master at some point, but we can start the review cycles this way

2015-11-25T15:53:54 <jhung> anastasiac: Just wanted to check with you - the FD Tool is a new docs site, correct? Is the Prefs Framework a new site too?
2015-11-25T15:54:32 <anastasiac> jhung, the prefs framework has no docs site of its own; its docs live within the Infusion docs
2015-11-25T15:54:50 <jhung> ok so it\'s just FD tool that is a new site anastasiac.
2015-11-25T15:54:58 <anastasiac> right
2015-11-25T15:55:06 <anastasiac> and it\xe2\x80\x99s actually not quite public yet, jhung
2015-11-25T15:55:15 <jhung> yep got it anastasiac.
2015-11-25T15:55:47 <anastasiac> the content hasn\xe2\x80\x99t yet been merged into master (waiting on Bosmon for that), and once it\xe2\x80\x99s in master, it should probably be made public somewhere other than my personal github pages branch, jhung :-)
2015-11-25T15:57:03 <michelled> Bosmon: are you able to do that merge anastasiac mentioned above?
2015-11-25T15:57:22 <jhung> ok no prob anastasiac. I was just going to mention it as something in development in an email to the list.

2015-11-25T18:46:57 <colinclark> "Personal Mastery: If a system is to serve the creative spirit, it must be entirely comprehensible to a single individual."
2015-11-25T18:47:43 <simonjb> colinclark: yeah, super-interesting
2015-11-25T18:47:55 <danayo> +1
2015-11-25T18:47:58 <colinclark> I simultaneously agree and disagree with it strongly
2015-11-25T18:48:01 <colinclark> which is what makes it awesome :)
2015-11-25T18:48:48 <danayo> disagree because of the emphasis on individualism colinclark?
2015-11-25T18:49:07 <colinclark> I guess so, in a sense
2015-11-25T18:49:22 <colinclark> I get to use a cool critical theory word here :P
2015-11-25T18:49:33 <colinclark> I think individuation is really important
2015-11-25T18:49:49 * lliskovoi joined the channel
2015-11-25T18:49:54 <colinclark> But I think at the same time, software offers an unprecedented opportunity for connecting knowledge
2015-11-25T18:50:07 <colinclark> in a way that goes beyond simple quotation
2015-11-25T18:50:14 <simonjb> agreed
2015-11-25T18:50:37 <simonjb> man, I\'m really looking forward to this afternoon :)
2015-11-25T18:51:28 <jhung> colinclark, danayo: this was brought up during "Future of OER" talk at OpenEd. It relates to mastery learning - is it similar to personal mastery you are talking about? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom\'s_2_Sigma_Problem

2015-11-25T18:56:34 * slim_ has quit
2015-11-25T18:58:23 <danayo> not sure jhung, in the smalltalk article it sounds more like they are putting the responsibility on the system, rather than method of instruction or learning
2015-11-25T18:58:35 <colinclark> yup
2015-11-25T18:58:54 <colinclark> In part, the argument is similar to our "mismatch between user need and the system\'s ability to meet it"
2015-11-25T18:59:04 <colinclark> This is the article, jhung: http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs655/readings/smalltalk.html
2015-11-25T18:59:35 <jhung> ah colinclark. Thanks I was jumping in the middle of the convo. Thanks for the context.
2015-11-25T18:59:38 <colinclark> no worries
2015-11-25T19:00:10 <colinclark> I guess the argument I\'m thinking of against it is also applicatable to Bloom
2015-11-25T19:00:25 <colinclark> in the sense that, as I read this, there are very strict roles between "teacher" and "learner"
2015-11-25T19:00:32 <colinclark> potentially missing the role for communities of learners
2015-11-25T19:00:41 <colinclark> who serve as both teachers and learners within their peer groups
2015-11-25T19:01:03 <colinclark> not unlike Ivan Illich\'s communities of self-organized learners, mediated by technology as a connector
2015-11-25T19:01:05 <jhung> yes. Actually that point was brought up in a passionate Q&A during that session colinclark. :)
2015-11-25T19:01:11 <colinclark> :)
2015-11-25T19:07:54 <michelled> colinclark: http://portal.teco.edu/dspace/?q=en/node/65
2015-11-25T19:08:15 <colinclark> wow, how very strange :)
2015-11-25T19:08:36 <colinclark> I wonder if we need to add a short sentence about how it can be used in the context of accessibility?
2015-11-25T19:09:21 <colinclark> "Flocking provides a building block for providing alternatives to visual content in the form of sonifications or other types of audio cues" or something to that effect
2015-11-25T19:09:31 <colinclark> I\'m trying to remember if I\'ve written anything about sonification and Flockign
2015-11-25T19:09:33 <michelled> good idea
2015-11-25T19:09:36 <colinclark> I\'m sure I have in some proposals
2015-11-25T19:09:36 <michelled> anastasiac: ^
2015-11-25T19:09:42 <colinclark> but something like that should work
