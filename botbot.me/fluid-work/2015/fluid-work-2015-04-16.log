2015-04-16T15:46:34 <cindyli> hi kasparnet, I saw your email about merging my pull request (https://github.com/GPII/prefsEditors/pull/85) for GPII-1014 into the review3 branch. are you waiting on it for the pilot? just wanna figure out how urgent it is and whether I should switch off from PGA to do it first.
2015-04-16T15:50:05 <kasparnet> cindyli: the idea was to use if for the pilot - but it's a pretty late warning and I'm not sure it's vital
2015-04-16T15:50:16 <kasparnet> and PGA is down to the wire as well
2015-04-16T15:50:20 <kasparnet> so stick to that for now
2015-04-16T15:50:38 <cindyli> got it. thanks, kasparnet
2015-04-16T15:50:46 <kasparnet> we'll see if nikos will bite - and else I'll discuss on monday the importance of it when I meet ppl F2F in berlin
2015-04-16T15:50:54 <cindyli> cool

2015-04-16T16:03:45 <jhung> the 404 page is VERY basic anastasiac. I'll file a jira for styling it.

2015-04-16T19:54:39 <anastasiac> jhung, could you help my overloaded brain, and make sure the iteration page has all these pull requests you\xe2\x80\x99re whipping off?
2015-04-16T19:58:43 <jhung> The only one that can be wiped is the Pull #51 (404 page).
2015-04-16T19:59:11 <jhung> I can mark that one as done and we can create a new jira for styling if needed.

2015-04-16T13:24:00 <simonjb> that\'s great, thanks jhung

2015-04-16T13:44:20 <anastasiac> jhung, good question. It seems to me that tutorials is not quite the right place for it. If I was an integrator lookingto upgrade, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t look for that info in a Tutorials section
2015-04-16T13:44:30 * the-t-in-rtf has quit

2015-04-16T13:44:34 <anastasiac> well
2015-04-16T13:44:41 <anastasiac> that\xe2\x80\x99s a whole other question
2015-04-16T13:45:44 <simonjb> on the TOC, the "Migrating to Infusion 1.5" section has 4 pages; 2 are in a tutorial subdir and 2 are in top

2015-04-16T13:46:20 <anastasiac> how important is this for next week, do you think?
2015-04-16T13:46:53 <simonjb> at this point, for me, I\'m thinking that we should minimise changes in case we break something
2015-04-16T13:47:14 <jhung> anastasiac, simonjb: ok. I\'ll leave it as-is.
2015-04-16T13:47:20 <simonjb> we should fix things that are broken, but leave other things as is
2015-04-16T13:47:37 <jhung> I\'ll make a note of that in the iteration plan page.
2015-04-16T13:47:43 <simonjb> thanks
2015-04-16T13:47:46 <anastasiac> simonjb, that\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking, too. Let\xe2\x80\x99s try to stabilize a bit, file JIRAs for known issues
2015-04-16T13:48:17 <simonjb> yes, I think we should be careful about making too many changes at this point

2015-04-16T14:08:43 <anastasiac> jhung, regarding the 404 pull request: what do I have to do to see the 404 page?
2015-04-16T14:09:12 * colinclark joined the channel
2015-04-16T14:12:30 <jhung> anastasiac: If you\'re using docpad\'s server, attempting to load an invalid URL should bring up the 404 page. If using apache, it may not show. You can also check by deploying to your gh-pages branch in your repo.
2015-04-16T14:12:46 <anastasiac> ok, jhung, I\xe2\x80\x99ll try the gh-pages route
2015-04-16T14:12:50 <jhung> k
2015-04-16T14:14:58 <anastasiac> jhung, it\xe2\x80\x99s not working in my gh-pages branch: http://acheetham.github.io/infusion-docs/infusion/latest/foo.html
2015-04-16T14:15:16 <anastasiac> and since we\xe2\x80\x99re using gh-pages for production, that\xe2\x80\x99s not promising
2015-04-16T14:17:20 <jhung> ah.
2015-04-16T14:17:44 <anastasiac> oh dear
2015-04-16T14:17:47 <anastasiac> bigger problems, jhung
2015-04-16T14:17:51 <jhung> anastasiac: This is because the 404.html page gets deployed into the wrong directory. It should go into the root.
2015-04-16T14:17:56 <anastasiac> docs. is still referencing my repo
2015-04-16T14:18:12 <anastasiac> ok, jhung, you fix your pull request, I\xe2\x80\x99ll figure out the cname stuff
2015-04-16T14:18:17 * jhung *facepalm*
2015-04-16T14:19:43 <jhung> ok anastasiac I\'ll need simonjb\'s help with this one since he added that extra deployment step for the directory nesting.
2015-04-16T14:25:53 <simonjb> hey jhung
2015-04-16T14:25:59 <simonjb> what\'s up?
2015-04-16T14:26:39 <jhung> The 404.html page gets deployed into the wrong directory simonjb. It should remain in the root directory.
2015-04-16T14:27:07 <simonjb> jhung: is it just an html page? no handlebars?
2015-04-16T14:27:52 <jhung> it\'s a plain old .md -> html page. No hb content simonjb
2015-04-16T14:28:07 <jhung> oh
2015-04-16T14:28:08 <jhung> wait
2015-04-16T14:28:28 <simonjb> jhung: does it link to css or images or other external files?
2015-04-16T14:28:59 <jhung> I lied. It does have hb templating in the file simonjb. No images. It uses the default template
2015-04-16T14:29:33 <jhung> you can see the branch here simonjb https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/pull/51
2015-04-16T14:30:13 <jhung> ^https://github.com/jhung/infusion-docs/tree/FLUID-5618
2015-04-16T14:30:51 <simonjb> jhung: the problem is that we want 2 different things: (1) to version the docs and have them hosted at /infusion/<version>/ and (2) files which are independent of the docs like redirects and 404s
2015-04-16T14:31:22 <simonjb> so, what we need to do is to put the 404 page into src/ghpages-files
2015-04-16T14:31:32 <simonjb> this will get deployed to the ghpages root
2015-04-16T14:31:52 <simonjb> but those files need to be self-contained and not reference the docs
2015-04-16T14:31:58 <simonjb> so we
2015-04-16T14:32:38 <simonjb> will need to make a 404 page which is HTML and if it references any external files (css and such) those also need to live in src/ghpages-files
2015-04-16T14:33:23 <jhung> gotcha simonjb
2015-04-16T14:33:27 <simonjb> jhung: once we move off ghpages those will live elsewhere but for now, we\'ll need some page to put them
2015-04-16T14:33:28 <jhung> I\'ll fix that.
2015-04-16T14:33:40 <simonjb> thanks jhung
2015-04-16T14:33:46 <jhung> I\'ll make it very simple 404 page without much styling
2015-04-16T14:33:55 <simonjb> awesome

2015-04-16T15:13:14 <jhung> anastasiac: So there\'s no real good way to test the 404 page without deploying. The reason is the 404 page needs to go into the root. So deploying to a fork\'s gh-pages branch won\'t work because it\'s located at username.github.io/infusion-docs/404.html
