b'2015-11-12T21:04:55 <colinclark> I think it\'s probably Github-specific, but I don\'t know
2015-11-12T21:05:03 <colinclark> definitely client-dependent
2015-11-12T21:05:16 <colinclark> except for those funny unicode emojis that some clients send
2015-11-12T21:05:47 <colinclark> \xe2\x98\xba

2015-11-12T21:06:37 <alanharnum> colinclark: working on it!
2015-11-12T21:06:41 <colinclark> hahaha
2015-11-12T21:17:27 <Justin_o> Bosmon: did this change kettle.dataSource.URL
2015-11-12T21:17:35 <Justin_o> i\'m getting na error that it can\'t be found
2015-11-12T21:24:34 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay, i\'ve got that working, though i could use Kettle master, but still needed to use the KETTLE-32 branch
2015-11-12T21:24:54 <Justin_o> Bosmon:  new issue is that I get an error if the url property is undefined, even if i pass in a hostname

2015-11-12T21:52:57 <avtar> Bosmon, colinclark: if the gpii/universal browser, node-based, and node-based production tests are run by a ci server should a test run be abandoned as soon as a class of tests fail? for example if the browser tests fail should the process stop and notifications be sent out or should the node-based and node-based production tests still get executed?
2015-11-12T21:53:13 <colinclark> \xc2\xa1GILL!
2015-11-12T21:53:34 <colinclark> I think I\'d want to know about the overall status
2015-11-12T21:53:49 <colinclark> certainly there\'s the case where tests just somehow dramatically fail in all contextsw
2015-11-12T21:53:54 <avtar> ok
2015-11-12T21:54:08 <colinclark> but mostly it would be good to see if they pass in one environment and not in the other
2015-11-12T21:54:15 <colinclark> this is my impression
2015-11-12T21:54:18 <avtar> makes sense
2015-11-12T21:54:19 <avtar> thanks

2015-11-12T22:54:48 <colinclark> Oh, alanharnum
2015-11-12T22:55:03 <colinclark> when you import Flocking into your chartAuthoring repo
2015-11-12T22:55:12 <colinclark> you\'ll unfortunately have to use a specific branch
2015-11-12T22:55:37 <colinclark> The so-called "core refactoring" branch https://github.com/colinbdclark/flocking/tree/core-refactoring
2015-11-12T22:55:43 <alanharnum> ok i can make a custom build of that
2015-11-12T22:56:00 <colinclark> Flocking\'s cool in that you don\'t have to make builds
2015-11-12T22:56:07 <colinclark> you can just grab the dist/ directory
2015-11-12T22:56:15 <alanharnum> EVEN COOLER
2015-11-12T22:56:45 <colinclark> let me just make sure the built files are up to date
2015-11-12T22:56:47 <alanharnum> i assume flocking-all.js is what i want?
2015-11-12T22:56:51 <colinclark> yep
2015-11-12T22:57:00 <colinclark> I found that grunt-watch eats up a ton of CPU in the latest version
2015-11-12T22:57:05 <colinclark> so I don\'t run it as frequently as I should
2015-11-12T22:58:49 <colinclark> alanharnum: Grab the latest version, I just pushed updated built files
2015-11-12T22:58:58 <colinclark> nothing that should impact us here, but just in case
2015-11-12T23:04:34 <colinclark> alanharnum: There is indeed a bug in flock.modelSynth
2015-11-12T23:04:44 <colinclark> where it is unable to contend with array-typed model values
2015-11-12T23:04:51 <colinclark> I\'m going to write some unit tests and push a fix for you if I can
2015-11-12T23:05:05 <alanharnum> colinclark: can it contend with object-based models instead? if it\'s easier i can generate those
2015-11-12T23:06:33 <colinclark> In this case, they really have to be arrays, since that\'s what the sequencer unit generator expects
2015-11-12T23:17:23 <colinclark> Bosmon: Were I to find the time, should I be reviewing #654?
2015-11-12T23:27:32 <colinclark> green bars, alanharnum

2015-11-12T16:56:28 <jhernandez> Bosmon: ok, right, "emit" is a feature of socket.io, sorry for that
2015-11-12T16:57:52 <anastasiac> jhung: good suggestion on the chart authoring link. I\xe2\x80\x99ve updated the FLOE-435 pull request
2015-11-12T16:57:59 <jhernandez> do I have the chance to redeem myself? :P
2015-11-12T16:59:57 <Bosmon> jhernandez - it will have to be the net time round, since I have now rewritten all this code : P
2015-11-12T17:00:11 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I\'m not sure what the question is about the code in question
2015-11-12T17:00:35 <Bosmon> But the fact that you have written a raw function rather than a grade seems unfortunate
2015-11-12T17:00:53 <Bosmon> Can you explain what you were trying to achieve by writing "minEditor.init" ?
2015-11-12T17:03:07 <jhernandez> Bosmon: ACK
2015-11-12T17:05:00 <alanharnum> jhung: redirects for ILDH are live and appear to be working
2015-11-12T17:05:16 <alanharnum> jhung: can I ask you to test them all & let me know if anything is failing?
2015-11-12T17:06:27 <jhung> alanharnum: will do
2015-11-12T17:11:54 <Justin_o> Bosmon: the question there was a bit vague.. basically wondering what the preferred best practice is. I suppose the minEditor.init is there to simplify the usage. This is an example so it may be copied in the future, so probably a good idea to use best practice.
2015-11-12T17:12:50 <Justin_o> I guess minEditor.init is abstracting away some of the complexity about the builder

2015-11-12T17:18:50 * the-t-in-rtf joined the channel
2015-11-12T17:25:22 <jhung> alanharnum - it all looks good. However, I noticed the 404 page doesn\'t look right.
2015-11-12T17:26:18 <alanharnum> jhung: hm. assume correct one should be http://handbook.floeproject.org/404.html?
2015-11-12T17:26:37 <jhung> yep alanharnum
2015-11-12T17:29:19 <alanharnum> jhung: ok, give me a sec - gonna modify the Ansible role to let us configure a custom 404 page on a per-site basis & redeploy
2015-11-12T17:29:38 <jhung> ok thanks
2015-11-12T17:31:24 * the-t-in-rtf has quit
2015-11-12T17:32:38 <Bosmon> Justin_o - can you explain how it simplifies the usage?
2015-11-12T17:33:54 <Justin_o> Bosmon: for example it is just called liked this minEditor.init("#myMinEditor");
2015-11-12T17:34:26 <Justin_o> you don\'t need to know how to pass in the schema to the build options, like you would in fluid.prefs.create
2015-11-12T17:34:41 <Bosmon> Justin_o - ok
2015-11-12T17:34:56 <Bosmon> I think you could achieve just the same thing by writing a grade, which is our best practice
2015-11-12T17:35:21 <Bosmon> Also the use of "do it" style names like "init" is not a best practice
2015-11-12T17:36:47 <Justin_o> Bosmon: sure, thanks. how do you think we should best achieve this as a grade? fluid.prefs.create will automatically instantiate the component
2015-11-12T17:37:19 * jessm joined the channel
2015-11-12T17:37:24 <Justin_o> Bosmon: we could do something like we do for UIO i guess, https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/components/uiOptions/js/UIOptions.js
2015-11-12T17:37:31 <Bosmon> I guess this implies that the name "fluid.prefs.create" is not a best practice either : P
2015-11-12T17:37:35 <Bosmon> But it\'s a bit late to worry about that
2015-11-12T17:37:36 <Justin_o> but i\'m worried it might over complicate the example
2015-11-12T17:37:43 <Justin_o> Bosmon: :)
2015-11-12T17:39:21 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I see that the problem lies with fluid.prefs.create itself....
2015-11-12T17:39:39 <Bosmon> In that it is not actually a grade itself
2015-11-12T17:40:16 <Bosmon> We should really fix that, but we don\'t have time right now
2015-11-12T17:43:05 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yep true, should we go as is for now with the minEditor.init function, or do something else
2015-11-12T17:44:32 <alanharnum> jhung: does that look OK now?
2015-11-12T17:45:23 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I\'ve written up a JIRA at https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5817
2015-11-12T17:45:32 <Bosmon> So you can carry on with your init function and write a TODO referencing this JIRA

2015-11-12T19:40:28 <Bosmon> I imagine you might need a hand
2015-11-12T20:07:39 * alanharnum joined the channel
2015-11-12T20:07:41 <gtirloni> Bosmon: i\'ve been fixing one unrelated issue after the other and didn\'t make much progress today. will you be around tomorrow morning maybe?

2015-11-12T20:08:13 <gtirloni> cool, i\'ll definitely need a hand then.. thanks for checking
2015-11-12T20:13:38 <Justin_o> Bosmon: after talking to simonjb, cindyli, and avtar. we\'ve come up with following solution for configuring the FD Server for communicating with the security server.. that is for things like the url, clientid and client secret.
2015-11-12T20:14:27 <Justin_o> the implementer will set either environment variables or provide a JSON file in a specific directory... probably the root of the first discovery server
2015-11-12T20:15:09 <Justin_o> inside the index.js file, these two sources will be merged, with the environment variables taking precedence..
2015-11-12T20:15:43 <Justin_o> this will require some validation of the resultant object because if any of the values are missing, the app should error out
2015-11-12T20:15:55 * clown joined the channel
2015-11-12T20:15:56 <Justin_o> Bosmon: how does that sound?

2015-11-12T20:26:41 <Bosmon> Unfortunately I seem to have perpetrated yet another somewhat annoying Infusion bug
2015-11-12T20:28:05 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2015-11-12T20:29:31 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks, and what\'s the bug?
2015-11-12T20:30:50 * colinclark joined the channel
2015-11-12T20:48:51 <Bosmon> Justin_o: https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5818
2015-11-12T20:50:13 <Justin_o> Bosmon: interesting, i guess this doesn\'t happen too often though.
2015-11-12T20:50:24 <Bosmon> No
2015-11-12T20:50:48 <Bosmon> Although it happens quite a bit in the GPII, given it is quite a large design
2015-11-12T20:51:09 <Bosmon> I ran into an earlier instance of it when fixing the DeviceReporter per jhernandez comment earlier this evening, but I tried to brush it off : P
2015-11-12T20:51:23 <Justin_o> :)
2015-11-12T20:51:36 <Justin_o> Bosmon: speaking of issues, i\'m having some trouble with the kettle datasource
2015-11-12T20:51:42 <Bosmon> But there are now 2 arguments in the AuthzServer which don\'t resolve at all
2015-11-12T20:51:53 <Bosmon> Justin_o - what kind of trouble
2015-11-12T20:52:19 <Justin_o> if i set the url to url: "http://10.0.2.2:8081/access_token"
2015-11-12T20:52:27 <Justin_o> it\'ll connect fine
2015-11-12T20:52:39 <Justin_o> however, if i split that up at all it doesn\'t connect
2015-11-12T20:52:50 <Bosmon> Justin_o - how might you split it up?
2015-11-12T20:52:58 <Justin_o> for example i want to move the port out
2015-11-12T20:53:08 <Justin_o> using the port: 8081 option
2015-11-12T20:53:16 <Bosmon> Ah, I fixed that bug recently
2015-11-12T20:53:19 <Justin_o> i probably want to move the path out too
2015-11-12T20:53:21 <Bosmon> Are you using my latest trunk?
2015-11-12T20:53:46 <Justin_o> Bosmon:  i believe you said it should accept the options from https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_http_request_options_callback
2015-11-12T20:53:59 <Bosmon> Justin_o
2015-11-12T20:54:09 <Bosmon> There is a test for exactly this issue now: https://github.com/amb26/kettle/blob/KETTLE-32/tests/DataSourceTests.js#L65
2015-11-12T20:54:36 <Bosmon> Or if this doesn\'t cover your case, perhaps you could contribute a further fixture to this list describing the case you want to work
2015-11-12T20:55:37 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i think that\'s it, so i don\'t need to provide the url at all anymore
2015-11-12T20:55:41 <Justin_o> i could use hostname instead
2015-11-12T20:55:54 <Bosmon> Justin_o - you can supply either the URL or the broken-out options, or both
2015-11-12T20:56:01 <Bosmon> And the broken-out options will override the URL
2015-11-12T20:56:05 <Justin_o> Bosmon: great
2015-11-12T20:56:13 <Bosmon> I think I fixed this based on you reporting you wanted to do this last week or so : P
2015-11-12T20:56:58 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes, i talked to about that earlier. thanks :)
2015-11-12T20:57:23 <Justin_o> Bosmon: so the previous time we spoke you had asked me to use specific revisions of kettle and infusion, which are reflected here https://github.com/jobara/first-discovery-server/blob/FLOE-430/package.json#L37-L38
2015-11-12T20:58:02 <Bosmon> Justin_o - you should now use the ones which are current
2015-11-12T20:58:06 <Justin_o> I can\'t totally remember why for Kettle, but that version of kettle required some fixes that you had in one of your branches.
2015-11-12T20:58:08 <Justin_o> ah okay
2015-11-12T20:58:09 <Bosmon> In fact the last commit fixes exactly this issue: https://github.com/amb26/kettle/commit/81487aa01ff954e54d45986f8778829b127a40a8
2015-11-12T20:58:36 <Justin_o> Bosmon: should i switch back to using the master of both Infusion and Kettle then?
2015-11-12T20:58:42 <Justin_o> or are there dev releases for these?
2015-11-12T20:58:47 <Bosmon> Justin_o - no, master of Infusion is no good
2015-11-12T20:59:20 <Bosmon> You should use this revision: d9ab2cea604cc3108bdf028d70874d339df22720
2015-11-12T20:59:34 <Bosmon> Which is the one from this pull request - https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/653
2015-11-12T20:59:37 <Justin_o> Bosmon: is that from your branch?
2015-11-12T20:59:41 <Bosmon> THis represents my current "working tip"
2015-11-12T20:59:46 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay
2015-11-12T20:59:55 <Bosmon> That situation has emerged again where we have a SHADOW TRUNK : P
2015-11-12T20:59:57 <Justin_o> so master of kettle and this revision of infusion from your branch
2015-11-12T21:00:01 <Bosmon> Which will move along a bit further tonight
2015-11-12T21:00:02 <Bosmon> yes
2015-11-12T21:00:18 <Justin_o> Bosmon: that makes sense, shadows tend to get longer towards the evening
2015-11-12T21:00:23 <Bosmon> Yes
2015-11-12T21:00:29 <Bosmon> Especially 5 o\'clock shadows : P
2015-11-12T21:00:50 <Bosmon> Next week this should all stabilise
2015-11-12T21:00:52 <colinclark> shadow trunk
2015-11-12T21:01:00 <colinclark> better than a shadow slide deck for IBM :P
2015-11-12T21:01:01 <Bosmon> Since I\'m pretty close to having a working build of the GPII again
2015-11-12T21:01:38 <Justin_o> Bosmon, colinclark: anyone know how to make a smile with a 5 o\'clock shadow?
2015-11-12T21:01:47 <colinclark> hmm
2015-11-12T21:01:59 <colinclark> I guess one just has to wait
2015-11-12T21:02:38 <colinclark> I see a beard one in the emoji cheatsheet for Github

2015-11-12T16:23:00 <jhernandez> Bosmon: I'm very dissapointed with your statement!!
2015-11-12T16:23:02 <jhernandez> 22:33 < Bosmon> jhernandez curse you, you have not implemented a WebSocketsSettingsHandler at all! : P
2015-11-12T16:23:06 <jhernandez> xDDDDD
2015-11-12T16:23:46 <jhernandez> what a WebSocketsSettingsHandler is supposed to be for you?
2015-11-12T16:25:05 <jhernandez> (though I somehow have the same feeling as you) :P
2015-11-12T16:25:39 <Bosmon> jhernandez - it is a settings handler that uses the WebSockets protocol : P
2015-11-12T16:26:49 <jhernandez> well, we're using kettle's ws support
2015-11-12T16:32:59 <jhernandez> but if you're talking about the fact that the clients aren't getting the get/set payloads by themselves, you're absolutely right - I haven't implemented a WebSocketsSettingsHandler
2015-11-12T16:33:03 <jhernandez> Bosmon: ^
2015-11-12T16:33:38 <michelled> hi Bosmon, where should I look to see state of the art Infusion tests? I'm fixing up Kaye's UIO pull requests and I sense the tests are outdated
2015-11-12T16:36:57 <Bosmon> jhernandez - I am referring more to the fact that it does not use the WebSockets protocol!
2015-11-12T16:38:14 <Bosmon> Hi michelled - our testing system hasn't changed very much since the old days
2015-11-12T16:38:34 <Bosmon> We use plain jqUnit tests for unit tests and integration tests that are mostly synchronous
2015-11-12T16:39:07 <Bosmon> And the IoC testing framework for tests which are more conversational in nature and against larger bodied of implementation
2015-11-12T16:39:16 <Bosmon> What about the tests seems outdated to you?
2015-11-12T16:39:23 <Bosmon> It may be that they are simply not factored very well
2015-11-12T16:39:35 <Bosmon> It would hardly be the first time someone produced a set of very poorly factored tests :)
