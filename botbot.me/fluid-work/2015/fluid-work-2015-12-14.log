2015-12-14T20:13:42 <jhung> simonjb: I\'ve updated the Jira related to the external links issue on the docs. https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5773
2015-12-14T20:14:03 <jhung> Feel free to add a comment there simonjb
2015-12-14T20:38:42 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay, let me know if you change your mind when it\'s ready for review again. hopefully it\'ll be ready shortly

2015-12-14T20:50:26 <Justin_o> Bosmon: does fluid.fail cause a jqUnit failure
2015-12-14T20:50:49 <Justin_o> Bosmon: now that I\'ve switched, i guess an extra test being run and failing
2015-12-14T20:51:29 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes it does
2015-12-14T20:51:39 <Justin_o> Bosmon: is there a way to prevent that
2015-12-14T20:51:44 <Bosmon> Justin_o, yes, several
2015-12-14T20:51:49 <Bosmon> I was running through them with simonjb earlier
2015-12-14T20:52:00 <Justin_o> Bosmon: oh really
2015-12-14T20:52:43 <Justin_o> Bosmon: are those in the channel logs somewhere?
2015-12-14T20:52:45 <Bosmon> For synchronous tests, there is the utility http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/jqUnit.html#jqunit-expectframeworkdiagnostic-message-toinvoke-errortexts-
2015-12-14T20:53:25 <Bosmon> And then for async tests using the IoC testing framework, there is this Kettle utility: https://github.com/amb26/kettle/blob/KETTLE-32/lib/test/KettleTestUtils.js#L87
2015-12-14T20:53:32 <Bosmon> Justin_o sadly it was on a VIDDEYO chatt
2015-12-14T20:53:57 <Justin_o> Bosmon: that\'s okay, you have docs

2015-12-14T21:05:17 <Bosmon> Justin_o - awesome
2015-12-14T21:06:49 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i am getting an issue with the actual app not being able to find gpii.resovlers.env now
2015-12-14T21:07:02 <Justin_o> which seems odd
2015-12-14T21:07:09 <Justin_o> i\'m still digging into that though
2015-12-14T21:09:43 * anvk has quit
2015-12-14T21:15:17 <Justin_o> Bosmon: so in my environment.json kettle config if i make a reference to {environment}.vars.SOME_NAME it works, but {gpii.resolvers.env}.vars.SOME_NAME doesn\'t
2015-12-14T21:15:57 <Justin_o> i get the error that "could not match context with name gpii.resolvers.env from component"
2015-12-14T21:17:25 <Bosmon> Justin_o - A typo, I imagine
2015-12-14T21:18:06 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i\'m using "{gpii.resolvers.env}.vars.FIRST_DISCOVERY_SERVER_TCP_PORT",
2015-12-14T21:18:46 <Justin_o> and in the gpii.configurator grade the type is set to gpii.resolvers.env
2015-12-14T21:19:14 <Justin_o> Bosmon:  this is the definition of the gpii.resolvers.env grade
2015-12-14T21:19:24 <Justin_o> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/wJz8TUGV/
2015-12-14T21:19:32 <Justin_o> did i set the single root correctly?
2015-12-14T21:20:01 <Justin_o> Bosmon: ^
2015-12-14T21:27:54 <Justin_o> Bosmon: based on http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/Contexts.html#global-components-fluid-resolveroot-and-fluid-resolverootsingle-
2015-12-14T21:28:07 <Justin_o> it seems that it is set up correctly
2015-12-14T21:28:12 <Justin_o> so i\'m not sure what the problem is
2015-12-14T21:28:32 <Justin_o> Bosmon: if you have any thoughts, please let me know and I\'ll try to fix it up tomorrow
2015-12-14T21:30:59 <Justin_o> Bosmon: temporarily switching back to {environment} so that it will work

2015-12-14T22:16:57 <Bosmon> Justin_o - ah yes, this will be a ginger resolution issue
2015-12-14T22:17:19 <Bosmon> But in fact you\'re sort of doing things twice - if you make the resolvers a subcomponent, you don\'t need to then also make it resolveRootSingle
2015-12-14T22:17:23 * gtirloni joined the channel
2015-12-14T22:17:39 <Bosmon> but since you *are* making it resolveRootSingle, you may as well just construct it in a freely floating way, rather than as part of your own tree
2015-12-14T22:17:44 <Bosmon> And that will then make the ginger issue go away too
2015-12-14T22:20:08 <Bosmon> We tend to use the API http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/IoCAPI.html#fluid-construct-path-options-instantiator- for this, so that the path you supply there makes it easier to find again

2015-12-14T18:34:10 <colinclark> sgithens is the person to talk to about scripts for provisioning NFC tokens
2015-12-14T18:34:26 <colinclark> I think he did some work on it--just sketch-level work--a while ago
2015-12-14T18:35:32 * yzen joined the channel
2015-12-14T18:35:32 * yzen is now known as yzen_
2015-12-14T18:43:18 <jhernandez> bens___: so far, this is what we have ATM https://github.com/GPII/linux-rfid-user-listener
2015-12-14T18:44:07 <jhernandez> you can use https://github.com/GPII/linux-rfid-user-listener/blob/master/pcscutil.py in order to create gpii tags
2015-12-14T18:45:11 <jhernandez> BUT, they won't work across different platforms
2015-12-14T18:46:00 <jhernandez> what we did in Cloud4all was using a tool such as GoToTags or Android's tagwriter
2015-12-14T18:58:52 * yzen_ is now known as yzen
2015-12-14T19:00:34 <colinclark> so jhernandez, if you were implementing a component for writing GPII key tokens to NFC
2015-12-14T19:00:41 <bens___> jhernandez, do you mean the pcscutil.py doesn't work across platforms or that the tags it creates don't work across platforms?
2015-12-14T19:01:03 <colinclark> would you write a Node.js library using one of the nfc modules?
2015-12-14T19:12:08 <jhernandez> bens___: I'd say both
2015-12-14T19:13:29 <jhernandez> I mean, we haven't tested it on Windows
2015-12-14T19:14:14 <jhernandez> and, that tag writer uses plain text tokens (not NDEF)
2015-12-14T19:16:33 <jhernandez> colinclark: why not? the only thing we must be considering is whether our module will run cross-platform
2015-12-14T19:16:43 <colinclark> yup, I think it makes sense
2015-12-14T19:16:52 <colinclark> I just wanted to confirm that this was your impression, too
2015-12-14T19:18:51 <jhernandez> and of course, how compatible is with different readers and tags
2015-12-14T19:19:34 <jhernandez> and yeah, that'd be great
2015-12-14T19:25:47 * cindyli joined the channel

2015-12-14T20:04:50 <Justin_o> would i call it like {gpii.resolvers.env}.env.someName or {env}.env.someName
2015-12-14T20:05:27 <Justin_o> and in that case maybe we should change the second env to vars
2015-12-14T20:05:34 <Justin_o> i.e. {env}.vars.someName
2015-12-14T20:05:37 <Justin_o> what do you think?
2015-12-14T20:05:38 <Bosmon> Justin_o - the former, and yes, I agree
2015-12-14T20:05:38 <Justin_o> Bosmon: ^
2015-12-14T20:05:52 <Justin_o> Bosmon: cool thanks
