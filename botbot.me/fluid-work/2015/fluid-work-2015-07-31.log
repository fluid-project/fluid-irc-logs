2015-07-31T21:00:24 <colinclark> I was saying to simonjb in person
2015-07-31T21:01:05 <colinclark> that it does seem entirely reasonable to expect, as a user, that if you have a privacy policy in place, that it is enacted even before a component that may be in some way considered "third party" gets access to it
2015-07-31T21:01:15 <Bosmon> yes
2015-07-31T21:01:22 <colinclark> and while I fully expect that we will always actually only have one primary matchmaker implementation
2015-07-31T21:01:38 <colinclark> the architecture does open up the possibility for variation and innovation and competition amongst matchmakers
2015-07-31T21:01:41 <colinclark> in a wondeful future world
2015-07-31T21:01:55 <colinclark> wonderful
2015-07-31T21:02:41 <Bosmon> colinclark - speaking of wonderful future worlds, web NFC work has now moved to here: https://www.w3.org/community/web-nfc/
2015-07-31T21:02:52 <colinclark> yeah
2015-07-31T21:02:58 <colinclark> which smells in some strange way to me
2015-07-31T21:03:14 <colinclark> community groups are interestnig
2015-07-31T21:03:20 <colinclark> in that they are really very informal
2015-07-31T21:03:21 <Bosmon> Led by Intel, it looks like
2015-07-31T21:03:39 <colinclark> it\'s almost as if Apple and Google both said "we\'ll never implement this"
2015-07-31T21:03:47 <colinclark> and thus it was relegated to community WG status
2015-07-31T21:04:30 <colinclark> I was thinking about this the other day while chatting with Gregg about how strategic Chrome OS needs to be for the GPII
2015-07-31T21:04:52 <colinclark> Because, among other reasons, they are still selling widly in the education sector
2015-07-31T21:05:08 <colinclark> it looks like people have cobbled together some NFC APIs for Chrome Apps: https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-nfc
2015-07-31T21:05:25 <Bosmon> Yes
2015-07-31T21:05:26 <colinclark> or rather, Google has created a demo
2015-07-31T21:05:27 <Bosmon> I was just looking at that
2015-07-31T21:05:39 <Bosmon> It looks like you\'re expected to "just muck in" at the USB level
2015-07-31T21:05:54 <colinclark> I guess the Chromebook reference architecture just doesn\'t include NFC
2015-07-31T21:06:01 <Bosmon> Which I guess makes sense at least at the Chrome OS integration point
2015-07-31T21:06:03 <colinclark> and pretty much everyone builds off Google\'s reference models
2015-07-31T21:06:19 <colinclark> I guess I should eat lunch one of these days, eek
2015-07-31T21:06:31 <Bosmon> https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-nfc/blob/master/src/usb.js
2015-07-31T21:06:37 <Bosmon> "low level cruft", as it advertises : P
2015-07-31T21:06:40 <Bosmon> ouch
2015-07-31T21:06:44 <Bosmon> I guess I\'ll eat dinner

2015-07-31T20:48:30 <simonjb> Bosmon: are you still around?
2015-07-31T20:49:45 <Bosmon> Hi there simonjb
2015-07-31T20:50:25 <simonjb> hey
2015-07-31T20:50:39 <simonjb> so, interesting issue regarding filtering and match making
2015-07-31T20:51:03 <simonjb> I have moved the filtering to act on the matchMakerOutput
2015-07-31T20:51:09 <Bosmon> simonjb - cool
2015-07-31T20:51:28 <simonjb> and have tested with a user with screen reader preferences and magnifier preferences -- li
2015-07-31T20:51:45 <simonjb> I have configured filtering to only share magnifier settings
2015-07-31T20:51:58 <simonjb> this works as expected
2015-07-31T20:52:01 <simonjb> except...
2015-07-31T20:52:06 <Bosmon> except!
2015-07-31T20:52:08 <simonjb> orca is lanuched
2015-07-31T20:52:38 <simonjb> because it is in the matchMakerOutput -- the match maker has already seen the full preferences and determined that a screen reader is needed
2015-07-31T20:52:59 <simonjb> so, I filter out the screen reader settings
2015-07-31T20:53:13 <simonjb> but there is still an entry for orce
2015-07-31T20:53:17 <simonjb> orca
2015-07-31T20:53:39 <Bosmon> simonjb - ok.... this sounds, in theory, like a bug we have always had
2015-07-31T20:53:46 <Bosmon> Even when we applied the filtering to "activeConfiguration"
2015-07-31T20:53:47 <Bosmon> Is this right?
2015-07-31T20:53:54 <simonjb> yes
2015-07-31T20:54:00 <Bosmon> ok
2015-07-31T20:54:16 <Bosmon> Perhaps this suggests that we do in fact need to apply the filtering twice
2015-07-31T20:54:19 <simonjb> it implies, I think the need to filter before the match maker sees the prefs
2015-07-31T20:54:26 <Bosmon> Yes
2015-07-31T20:54:32 <Bosmon> It seemed to be implying the same thing to me : P
2015-07-31T20:54:38 <simonjb> :(
2015-07-31T20:55:16 <Bosmon> We can punt the issue for now, if we write it up properly, I think
2015-07-31T20:55:33 <Bosmon> We were always aware of this risk, I think, we just hadn\'t appreciated how direct it was
2015-07-31T20:55:58 <simonjb> it was less of a risk in the web app cloud case
2015-07-31T20:56:04 <Bosmon> I would carry on with your existing implementation for now, and we can bring this up at next Wednesday\'s arch meeting
2015-07-31T20:57:17 <simonjb> now that we are processing a user\'s full system config filtering a user\'s settings after the match maker has seen them will lead to issues
2015-07-31T20:57:39 <simonjb> colinclark ^
