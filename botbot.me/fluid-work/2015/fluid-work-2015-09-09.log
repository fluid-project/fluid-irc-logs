2015-09-09T13:39:42 <Justin_o> Bosmon: I\'m trying to update the First Discovery Tool to the latest Infusion. I think I have the components themselves working, and want to get the tests all working now. So i have a selfVoicing component that takes fluid.textToSpeech as a base grade. I want to replace that base grade with the MockTTS. Is there  a way to do that with the latest framework
2015-09-09T13:39:42 <Justin_o> changes. I\'m guessing something to do with contextAware

2015-09-09T14:05:13 <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: does anyone have anything they\'d like to talk about at the community meeting today. I was supposed to lead it, but am not feeling well enough to do so. If no one has anything I\'ll just cancel it. But I\'d like to make the call by 10:30 so that I can let Maria know.

2015-09-09T17:59:13 <cindyli> simonjb, Justin_o, can you have a look at this doc of the couchDB design for the OAuth security server: https://wiki.gpii.net/w/CoachDB_Designs_for_Saving_and_Retrieving_Security_Data your feedback is appreciated.
2015-09-09T18:05:02 <simonjb> thanks very much cindyli, I will take a look now
2015-09-09T18:05:09 <cindyli> thanks, simonjb
2015-09-09T18:09:16 * kasparnet has quit
2015-09-09T18:09:24 <simonjb> cindyli, a tiny thing: you have "type": string in the left col for authDecision rather than "type": "authDecision"
2015-09-09T18:09:35 <simonjb> in the first table
2015-09-09T18:09:52 <cindyli> good catch, simonjb. correcting..
