2015-07-13T15:49:50 <Justin_o> Bosmon: just wanted to make sure you know that my infusion pull requests are ready to go
2015-07-13T15:50:23 <Justin_o> Bosmon: also you merged https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/614 but the jira is still open, can it be closed now?
2015-07-13T15:51:27 <cindyli> Bosmon or Bosmon7, can you review my pull request - https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/617
2015-07-13T15:51:28 * sepideh joined the channel
2015-07-13T15:53:13 <Bosmon> Thanks, Justin_o - I'll take a look - I closed the JIRA just now
2015-07-13T15:53:20 <Bosmon> cindyli - yes, reading
2015-07-13T15:53:22 <Justin_o> Bosmon: great thanks

2015-07-13T16:31:48 <Justin_o> sepideh, murilocrivellari: should a user be allowed to enter negative values into the chart authoring tool?
2015-07-13T16:35:57 <murilocrivellari> that's a good question, Justin_o. In theory, yes, as long as the total percentage is 100%
2015-07-13T16:36:03 * jessm has quit
2015-07-13T16:36:36 <Justin_o> murilocrivellari: how would it be represented in the chart?
2015-07-13T16:37:20 * jhernandez joined the channel
2015-07-13T16:37:40 <murilocrivellari> the issue here is that having negative values would make possible to have percentage totals other than 100%. We would then need an error screen...
2015-07-13T16:38:41 <Justin_o> murilocrivellari: would it be better to require positive numbers then?
2015-07-13T16:41:43 <murilocrivellari> Justin_o: I'm not sure... Can we wait to check Sepi's thoughts on that? She seems to be away...
2015-07-13T16:42:00 <Justin_o> murilocrivellari: sure

2015-07-13T16:50:34 <jhung1> in 10 minutes michelled?
2015-07-13T16:50:53 <michelled> actually, I can't until around 2:00
2015-07-13T16:50:55 <jhung1> or any time michelled
2015-07-13T16:51:02 <jhung1> sure. 2p works for me.
2015-07-13T16:51:06 <michelled> ok, I'll ping you later when I'm free
