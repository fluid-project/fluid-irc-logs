b"2015-08-17T18:26:04 <gtirloni> speaking of docpad, we discussed automatically generating docs for all tags.. i couldn't find a way for docpad to interact with Git itself.. but I've got a deployment script that iterates over the tags, generates the docs and pushes them to the right directory... when we're ready to move ahead with that idea, just let me know :)

2015-08-17T14:48:32 <simonjb> hey Bosmon and kasparnet, a week and a half ago I was discussing at the arch meeting an issue regarding filtering after the match maker has seen the full preferences
2015-08-17T14:48:46 <kasparnet> hey simonjb
2015-08-17T14:48:54 <simonjb> I had hoped to go into more detail at last week\'s meeting but was sick
2015-08-17T14:49:08 <simonjb> but now I
2015-08-17T14:49:21 <simonjb> would really like to discuss if you have some time?
2015-08-17T14:52:36 <simonjb> Bosmon, kasparnet: would you both have any time before wednesday?
2015-08-17T14:59:05 <kasparnet> Besides the official GPII/C4A meetings on the calendars, I\'m available
2015-08-17T15:01:09 * michelled1 joined the channel
2015-08-17T15:02:41 <simonjb> thanks kasparnet, let\'s see when would be good for Bosmon -- it\'s not super urgent as I\'m not blocked but I\'d like to discuss it with you both

2015-08-17T15:20:44 <taliesin_> Hi Folks. I have a question regarding the IDRC Preferences Widget.
2015-08-17T15:22:01 <taliesin_> Is there a way to get to panel via the keyboard? When I hit the Tab Key after selecting the preferences tab, I go to the next focusable item in the page content rather than to the controls in the preferences widget.
2015-08-17T15:23:15 <taliesin_> Not sure if this is correct chat room for this question or if I should post to the issue to the email list?

2015-08-17T15:40:44 <taliesin_> Thanks Anastasic. I thought I tried that. You are right, the shit-tab gets me into the panel. Where\xe2\x80\x99s the list of \xe2\x80\x9cknown issues\xe2\x80\x9d, on github?

2015-08-17T15:59:05 <Bosmon> simonjb - I can talk tomorrow, yes
2015-08-17T16:14:14 <Bosmon> anastasiac, jhung - would you be able to answer some questions about our docpad configuration for the framework docs?
2015-08-17T16:17:58 <anastasiac> I can certainly try, Bosmon, though I\xe2\x80\x99m not quite as familiar as jhung
2015-08-17T16:18:57 <Bosmon> So I\'m wondering about the configuration for the ghpages plugin
2015-08-17T16:19:53 <Bosmon> This document suggests that the plugin requires some configuration in the plugins/ghpages section: https://github.com/docpad/docpad-plugin-ghpages#github-pages-deployer-plugin-for-docpad
2015-08-17T16:19:54 <Bosmon> Ok
2015-08-17T16:20:21 <Bosmon> And as a perhaps more urgent side-issue, it appears that I have managed to deploy from the state of my branch directly to the real ghpages branch for the master repo?
2015-08-17T16:20:34 <Bosmon> I had assumed that the plugin would simply deploy to a local branch if I ran it
2015-08-17T16:20:40 <Bosmon> I didn\'t realise that it would corrupt our live docs :)
2015-08-17T16:20:48 <Bosmon> Perhaps the README could have a slightly sterner warning....
2015-08-17T16:21:13 <anastasiac> Bosmon, yes, the ghpages deployment process is, well\xe2\x80\xa6 not optimal :-)
2015-08-17T16:21:25 <anastasiac> and yes, we need to document it
2015-08-17T16:21:43 <Bosmon> If this channel weren\'t logged for all time, I might have a slightly blunter way of describing it :)
2015-08-17T16:21:43 <anastasiac> I\xe2\x80\x99ve done the same thing \xe2\x80\x93\xc2\xa0deployed my branch to production!
2015-08-17T16:23:02 <anastasiac> unfortunately, I\xe2\x80\x99m probably not the best person to help with this. jhung has the issues clearer in his head than I do. Let me poke around in my notes to see if I can refresh my memory
2015-08-17T16:24:40 <Bosmon> Perhaps your notes might also contain the series of commands that I might issue to uncorrupt our live docs branch
2015-08-17T16:24:50 * kasparnet has quit
2015-08-17T16:25:34 <anastasiac> Bosmon: I believe the process to restore the production site to master would be to checkout master and re-run that ghpages-deploy
2015-08-17T16:25:44 * cindyli has quit
2015-08-17T16:25:53 <Bosmon> anastasiac - ok
2015-08-17T16:25:56 <Bosmon> will do
2015-08-17T16:26:04 <anastasiac> Bosmon: did you want to deploy your branch to your ghpages? or just deploy locally?
2015-08-17T16:26:19 <Bosmon> anastasiac - to start with, I just wanted to see what the plugin did :)
2015-08-17T16:26:30 <anastasiac> well, now you know!
2015-08-17T16:26:33 <Bosmon> Given I could see no docs about it, it had little choice but to try to run it : P
2015-08-17T16:26:51 <anastasiac> yes, we should update the readme
2015-08-17T16:26:59 <Bosmon> Especially since this plugin seems to be the reason that we\'ve written some scripts that totally screw up docpad\'s automatic incremental generation process
2015-08-17T16:27:31 <Bosmon> The behaviour I observe is, that if I make any update to the docs at all once this inbuilt webserver thing is running, it simply destroys all the files
2015-08-17T16:27:39 <Bosmon> Do you observe this too?
2015-08-17T16:27:41 <anastasiac> also, it\xe2\x80\x99s a bit scary to know that anyone out there can deploy their branch to our production site :-(
2015-08-17T16:27:57 <Bosmon> anastasiac - presumably only people with push access to our docs repo
2015-08-17T16:27:59 <anastasiac> yes, this is a known issue
2015-08-17T16:28:10 <Bosmon> A known issue
2015-08-17T16:28:13 <Bosmon> Is there a JIRA for it?
2015-08-17T16:28:30 <anastasiac> https://github.com/docpad/docpad-plugin-ghpages/issues/24
2015-08-17T16:29:17 <Bosmon> anastasiac - that seems to be a related, but not equivalent issue
2015-08-17T16:29:26 <Bosmon> I\'m talking about what happens to the local files, rather than to the production site
2015-08-17T16:29:40 <anastasiac> Bosmon: you mean the content of the out folder
2015-08-17T16:29:42 <anastasiac> ?
2015-08-17T16:29:49 <Bosmon> anastasiac - that, yes
2015-08-17T16:30:19 <Bosmon> The docpad conversion process is extremely slow, and it would be great if I didn\'t have to run all of it again every time I make an edit
2015-08-17T16:30:27 <anastasiac> when you say \xe2\x80\x9cdestroys all the files\xe2\x80\x9d don\xe2\x80\x99t they regenerate, and replace automatically with updates?
2015-08-17T16:30:55 <Bosmon> It seems that it is making some attempts to do the work incrementally, but my impression is that we are screwing this up with the "writeAfter" script we have written
2015-08-17T16:30:58 <Bosmon> anastasiac - they don\'t
2015-08-17T16:31:21 <anastasiac> ah, ok, maybe this is something new that I haven\xe2\x80\x99t experienced
2015-08-17T16:31:31 <Bosmon> I get a bunch of 404 errors in the logs and all the files are gone
2015-08-17T16:31:41 <anastasiac> !!
2015-08-17T16:32:15 <Bosmon> anastasiac - it\'s not a surprise, since I believe we moved them somewhere else with our script
2015-08-17T16:32:29 <anastasiac> jhung or simonjb would be more aware of what that script is about, but it sounds like it has, indeed, introduced a bug
2015-08-17T16:32:35 <anastasiac> that might be worth fixing

2015-08-17T17:05:26 <simonjb> Bosmon, anastasiac: yeah that writeAfter stuff is needed for the ghpages plugin -- to rearrange the files before deploying
2015-08-17T17:05:38 <Bosmon> simonjb - I\'m fixing it up now
2015-08-17T17:05:56 <simonjb> Bosmon: ok, that\'s awesome
2015-08-17T17:05:59 <Bosmon> I think there will be another strategy for rearranging the files that doesn\'t involve trashing the incremental workflow
2015-08-17T17:06:19 <simonjb> that would be great
2015-08-17T17:06:36 <simonjb> one option I think could be to use a custom environment for ghpages
2015-08-17T17:06:40 <Bosmon> It takes at least 30 seconds on my machine for a full build
2015-08-17T17:06:46 <Bosmon> I don\'t know if it is much faster on yours

2015-08-17T18:00:30 <simonjb> nice, thanks for fixing that Bosmon
2015-08-17T18:00:30 <Bosmon> Trying to deal with some styling and consistency issues now
2015-08-17T18:00:57 <Bosmon> I\'ve removed the category known as "API" and there are a few lingering broken links and inconsistencies...
2015-08-17T18:01:33 <anastasiac> Bosmon, may I ask why you\xe2\x80\x99ve removed the category knows as API?
2015-08-17T18:02:54 <Bosmon> anastasiac - here\'s my mail from April: http://lists.idrc.ocad.ca/pipermail/fluid-work/2015-April/009654.html
2015-08-17T18:03:09 <Bosmon> It looks like nothing happened about any of this so I am taking it on myself
2015-08-17T18:03:57 <anastasiac> ah, right, thanks
