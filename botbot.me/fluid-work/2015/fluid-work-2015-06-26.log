2015-06-26T13:25:16 <Justin_o> Bosmon, colinclark: would either or both of you like to lead an Intro to Infusion community meeting. I\'m thinking July 15
2015-06-26T13:25:43 <colinclark> I\'d certainly co-lead such a session, yes
2015-06-26T13:25:50 <Justin_o> or potentially we could bump it up to July 8
2015-06-26T13:26:18 <colinclark> I need to make some material about learning Infusion for my Flocking documentation, so it might be a good combination
2015-06-26T13:26:42 <colinclark> I\'d be into co-presenting with Bosmon or simonjb or anyone else who is interested
2015-06-26T13:27:30 <Bosmon> Justin_o - July 8 will be better for me - I\'ll be away July 15 to 17
2015-06-26T13:27:55 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay.. i\'ll put it on July 8th and bump the Ansible one down
2015-06-26T13:28:12 <Justin_o> colinclark, Bosmon: thanks for leading the session... i\'ll update the community workshop page
2015-06-26T13:28:35 <colinclark> no problem
2015-06-26T13:29:07 <Justin_o> Bosmon, colinclark: by the way... did we settle on 1.9 as the last 1.x version number?
2015-06-26T13:31:01 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I think so, although I think the mechanism we had chosen was for it to simply become the name of a branch?
2015-06-26T13:31:36 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes.. agreed on the latter part.. i want to do some jira cleanup though.. so i\'m going to move all the current closed fixed for 2.0 to be fixed for 1.9

2015-06-26T17:02:34 <avtar> i think she will be here soon
2015-06-26T17:03:12 <avtar> she just walked in so _really_ soon

2015-06-26T17:41:12 <Bosmon> fluid-everyone - looks like npm 3 has just entered beta, for those who didn\'t see: https://github.com/npm/npm/releases/tag/v3.0.0
2015-06-26T17:41:21 <Bosmon> It seems to have a lot of very helpful features
2015-06-26T17:41:42 <Bosmon> Including: "Flat, flat, flat!
2015-06-26T17:41:42 <Bosmon> Your dependencies will now be installed maximally flat."
2015-06-26T17:42:09 <Justin_o> Bosmon: you sound excited
2015-06-26T17:42:19 <Justin_o> i guess that means we can drop the deduping
2015-06-26T17:42:42 <Bosmon> Justin_o - not necessarily - they don\'t say anything about git dependencies
2015-06-26T17:42:54 <Justin_o> ah :(
2015-06-26T17:42:57 <Bosmon> But the deep nesting issue was such a fatal flaw with npm that I think it threatened the entire enterprise
2015-06-26T17:43:08 <Bosmon> At least now there seems to be a reasonable chance that npm will continue to survive : P
2015-06-26T17:43:17 <Justin_o> :)
2015-06-26T17:44:56 <Bosmon> Justin_o - the issue we suffer from is still open, as far as I can see: https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/3081
2015-06-26T17:46:27 <Justin_o> hopefully they\'ll get to that soon
2015-06-26T17:47:34 <Bosmon> :)
2015-06-26T17:47:46 <Bosmon> Given the age of the bug, probably not before we start switching to the use of npm releases : P
2015-06-26T17:47:58 <Bosmon> I guess WAHHARNNUM will be with us as soon as next week
2015-06-26T17:48:52 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes, starting monday
2015-06-26T17:48:57 <Bosmon> excellent
2015-06-26T17:49:06 <Bosmon> What a glorious dawn that will be
2015-06-26T17:49:12 <Justin_o> :)

2015-06-26T18:53:12 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i want to create a model listener for "*" but would like it to return the full path to the change, but it looks like it only contains a top level path. E.g. if the model is {nested: {a: "a"}} and i change the path nested.a
2015-06-26T18:53:37 <Justin_o> the change path is just nested and the change value is something like {a: "A"}
2015-06-26T18:53:55 <Justin_o> but what i really want is nested.a and the change value is "A"
2015-06-26T18:55:33 <Bosmon> Justin_o - sadly that\'s not possible - and - how could it know how far up you wanted the change to be reported?
2015-06-26T18:55:48 <Bosmon> For example, why might it not be that the path is "nested" and the change is {a: "A"} ?
2015-06-26T18:56:14 <Justin_o> Bosmon: wouldn\'t it know that from the call to applier.change
2015-06-26T18:56:50 <Bosmon> Justin_o - that information has been long lost by the time the change has propagated - and it is not proper for it to be stored in any case
2015-06-26T18:56:59 <Bosmon> All the ways of bringing the model to its current condition should be considered equivalent
2015-06-26T18:57:11 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay
2015-06-26T18:57:12 <Bosmon> It\'s true that the old ChangeApplier paid attention to that kind of thing, but it was horribly broken : P
2015-06-26T18:57:25 <Justin_o> Bosmon: maybe you can suggest something to me
2015-06-26T18:57:33 <Bosmon> Justin_o - what\'s your situation?
2015-06-26T18:57:35 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i\'m working on the valuebinding stuff that we talked about yesterday
2015-06-26T18:57:41 <Justin_o> so right now i have a model listener on ""
2015-06-26T18:57:51 <Justin_o> and i update all the value bindings on any model change
2015-06-26T18:58:03 <Justin_o> but i figure it\'s a waste to update everything on every change
2015-06-26T18:58:12 <Justin_o> and would rather just update for the path that was changed in the model
2015-06-26T18:58:48 <Bosmon> Yes - you might want to consider fabricating a dynamic grade from the bindings that just registers changes to the parts that you want
2015-06-26T18:59:13 <Bosmon> Or - horror of horrors - you could register the modelListeners you want programmatically :)
2015-06-26T18:59:53 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay.. i\'ll see how far i can get with the first approach, and fall back to programatically if i can\'t get it work.
2015-06-26T19:00:23 <Justin_o> thanks
2015-06-26T19:00:38 <Bosmon> np - I assume the-t-in-rtf implementation adds listeners programmatically
2015-06-26T19:00:56 <Justin_o> Bosmon: it does
