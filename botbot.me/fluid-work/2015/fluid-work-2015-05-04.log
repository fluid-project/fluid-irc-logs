2015-05-04T13:50:06 <Justin_o> danaayotte: good morning, do you have a minute for some questions. Screen sharing would probably help.
2015-05-04T13:50:17 <Justin_o> anastasiac: I merged the FLOE-323 pull request
2015-05-04T13:50:28 <Justin_o> and left a comment on the FLOE-322 pull
2015-05-04T13:50:58 <anastasiac> thanks, Justin_o
2015-05-04T13:51:27 * avtar joined the channel
2015-05-04T13:51:39 <danaayotte> sure Justin_o
2015-05-04T13:52:02 <Justin_o> danaayotte: thanks, vidyo?
2015-05-04T13:52:13 <danaayotte> yes
2015-05-04T13:56:38 * simonjb joined the channel
2015-05-04T14:07:10 <anastasiac> danaayotte, the latest designs for the FD tool say things like \xe2\x80\x9cpress h for help\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cpress n to go to the next screen\xe2\x80\x9d but those keystrokes are not active yet. Do you think we should leave the instructions in nonetheless (given that the keys will eventually work, someday), or take them out until the keys actually work?
2015-05-04T14:07:45 <Justin_o> anastasiac, danaayotte: The 'h' sort of works. It will re-read the instructions.
2015-05-04T14:08:08 <anastasiac> ah, good to know Justin_o, thanks (I had my computer muted :-) But the N key doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work yet
2015-05-04T14:08:19 <Justin_o> correct
2015-05-04T14:08:30 <danaayotte> anastasiac, Justin_o I think we should leave them in
2015-05-04T14:08:57 <danaayotte> so folks understand that we will have that functionality eventually
2015-05-04T14:15:13 <Justin_o> danaayotte: okay, thankas

2015-05-04T14:33:12 <anastasiac> Justin_o, if the N key instructions remain, did you have any other comments on the FLOE-322 pull request?
2015-05-04T14:37:37 <Justin_o> anastasiac: i'll take another look soon. Fixing up some merge conflicts in my FLOE-299 branch.
2015-05-04T14:37:41 <Justin_o> but i don't think i did
2015-05-04T14:37:45 <anastasiac> k

2015-05-04T18:50:36 <Bosmon> cindyli - thanks, I addressed the comments
2015-05-04T18:50:44 <cindyli> thanks, Bosmon
2015-05-04T18:50:45 <Bosmon> Out of interest, what tool are you using that complains about a lack of a final newline?
2015-05-04T18:54:00 * yzen joined the channel
2015-05-04T18:54:00 * yzen is now known as yzen_
2015-05-04T18:54:18 * yzen_ is now known as yzen
2015-05-04T19:14:27 <cindyli> Bosmon: when you create or review a pull request, the comparison of files changed shows a special red char if a file doesn't have a newline at the end
2015-05-04T19:14:58 <cindyli> Bosmon: i just issued a pull request to update the prefs framework for FLUID-5599 - https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/598, can you review it?
2015-05-04T19:44:47 <Justin_o> simonjb: i've merged the FLOE-307 pull request
2015-05-04T19:45:09 <simonjb> ok, awesome, thanks Justin_o
