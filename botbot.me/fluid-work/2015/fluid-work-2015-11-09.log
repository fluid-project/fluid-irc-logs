2015-11-09T17:48:56 <simonjb> ok, thanks cindyli
2015-11-09T17:49:06 <cindyli> thanks for reviewing it, simonjb

2015-11-09T17:49:40 <simonjb> cindyli: sorry it\'s been delayed for so long
2015-11-09T17:51:01 <cindyli> not a problem, simonjb. other parts that will make use of this work are still under development anyway.
2015-11-09T17:51:18 <simonjb> ok, cool
2015-11-09T17:54:28 <jhung> anastasiac: I left you a comment on ILDH Pull #1
2015-11-09T18:05:49 <anastasiac> jhung, I\xe2\x80\x99m still seeing the 404 problem with the \xe2\x80\x9cdocument template\xe2\x80\x9d string
2015-11-09T18:06:09 <jhung> anastasiac: curious.
2015-11-09T18:06:31 <anastasiac> oh, wait
2015-11-09T18:07:35 <anastasiac> nope, still there, jhung
2015-11-09T18:08:41 <jhung> ok anastasiac I\'m in a meeting. I\'ll take a look after
2015-11-09T18:08:43 <anastasiac> jhung: https://github.com/jhung/docs-inclusive-learning/blob/FLUID-5808/src/layouts/404-page.html.handlebars#L6
2015-11-09T18:08:56 <anastasiac> and https://github.com/jhung/docs-inclusive-learning/blob/FLUID-5808/src/layouts/404-page.html.handlebars#L6
2015-11-09T18:09:06 <anastasiac> sorry, that should be https://github.com/jhung/docs-inclusive-learning/blob/FLUID-5808/src/layouts/404-page.html.handlebars#L59
2015-11-09T18:14:40 <anastasiac> colinclark and avtar: Regarding that qi infrastructure doc you wanted help with: what\xe2\x80\x99s the general timeline for that? this week-ish? or this month-ish? (just wanting to prioritize it appropriately in my to-do list)
2015-11-09T18:15:34 <Justin_o> anastasiac: i\'ve left comments on the FLUID-5757 infusion-docs pull request
2015-11-09T18:15:58 <anastasiac> Bosmon: I made some changes to the FD tool docs pull request in response to your most recent feedback https://github.com/GPII/docs-first-discovery/pull/1
2015-11-09T18:16:01 <anastasiac> thanks, Justin_o
2015-11-09T18:23:57 <simonjb> cindyli: I see that your pull request includes testData/ontologies/firstDiscovery-flat.json -- is that used in this pull request?
2015-11-09T18:24:45 <cindyli> simonjb: yes, it affects the data structure of preference sets being saved by the prefs server
2015-11-09T18:25:13 <simonjb> cindyli: does the prefs server pick it up automatically?
2015-11-09T18:25:23 <cindyli> with this ontology file, the preference set will be saved as "firstDiscovery": {...}
2015-11-09T18:25:28 <cindyli> yes, simonjb
2015-11-09T18:25:39 <simonjb> great, thanks cindyli
2015-11-09T18:25:46 <cindyli> without it, the saved data looks like "flat": {\xe2\x80\xa6}
2015-11-09T18:25:48 <cindyli> np, simonjb
2015-11-09T18:29:09 <colinclark> Justin_o: I just commented on your pull request to the First Discovery repository
2015-11-09T18:29:18 <Justin_o> colinclark:  thanks
2015-11-09T18:29:33 <colinclark> You can\'t change the copyright of code we\'ve written
2015-11-09T18:29:47 <colinclark> and authorship should be clearly attributed, at all times to OCAD University
2015-11-09T18:29:48 <Justin_o> colinclark: what about the stuff for the first discovery server?
2015-11-09T18:29:53 <Justin_o> which copyright should that get
2015-11-09T18:30:19 <colinclark> Everything we write as part of our research here is owned by OCAD University
2015-11-09T18:30:26 <colinclark> and so the copyright should always reflect that
2015-11-09T18:30:38 <Justin_o> colinclark: so i only changed the copyright statement in the licence, not in the individual files
2015-11-09T18:30:46 <colinclark> It shouldn\'t be changed anywhere
2015-11-09T18:31:00 * alanharnum has quit
2015-11-09T18:31:01 <colinclark> people can add their organization to the copyright statements as they contribute code
2015-11-09T18:31:04 <Justin_o> colinclark: hmm so what should be in the License?
2015-11-09T18:31:33 <colinclark> If you wrote it, it should say Copyright 2015 OCAD University
2015-11-09T18:31:53 <Justin_o> colinclark:  i mean this line https://github.com/GPII/first-discovery/blob/master/LICENSE.txt#L1
2015-11-09T18:32:05 <colinclark> it should say exactly that :)
2015-11-09T18:32:43 <Justin_o> colinclark: even though this is part of GPII
2015-11-09T18:32:47 <colinclark> Yes
2015-11-09T18:33:04 <colinclark> The GPII isn\'t an organization or institution or company
2015-11-09T18:33:11 <Justin_o> colinclark: i guess i don\'t understand organized
2015-11-09T18:33:12 <Justin_o> yes
2015-11-09T18:33:14 <Justin_o> thanks
2015-11-09T18:33:35 <colinclark> The top-level copyright statement should reflect the "principal author"
2015-11-09T18:33:45 <colinclark> which in the case of the First Discovery tool is OCAD University
2015-11-09T18:33:56 <Justin_o> so the first org to create a repo sort of stakes a claim to copyrights. but individual contributors can add theirs to the files they modify?
2015-11-09T18:34:03 <Justin_o> okay
2015-11-09T18:34:13 <colinclark> I wouldn\'t say "first org stakes a claim"
2015-11-09T18:34:20 <colinclark> I\'d say "principal copyright holder"
2015-11-09T18:34:24 <colinclark> but yes
2015-11-09T18:34:50 <colinclark> One might imagine this copyright statement being updated at some point when the overall percentage of contributions come from a different organization
2015-11-09T18:34:55 <colinclark> or person
2015-11-09T18:35:00 <Justin_o> colinclark: how is the "principal copyright holder" determined, wouldn\'t that potentially change over time if it is based on the lines of code and etc.
2015-11-09T18:35:07 <Justin_o> okay thanks
2015-11-09T18:35:17 <Justin_o> i think that\'s clear now
2015-11-09T18:36:49 <Justin_o> colinclark: is this needed in the license
2015-11-09T18:36:54 <Justin_o> The research leading to these results has received funding from
2015-11-09T18:36:54 <Justin_o> +the European Union\'s Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under grant agreement no. 289016.
2015-11-09T18:37:20 <colinclark> No
2015-11-09T18:37:30 <Justin_o> colinclark: okay, i\'ll take that out too
2015-11-09T18:37:38 <colinclark> That\'s only for software that received support from the European Commission
2015-11-09T18:37:48 <colinclark> and as you know, we don\'t receive money from the European Commission :)
2015-11-09T18:37:58 <colinclark> though some of our partners do, so it may be added as needed by them
2015-11-09T18:38:05 <Justin_o> okay thanks
2015-11-09T18:39:32 * Bosmon7 joined the channel
2015-11-09T18:41:27 <simonjb> cindyli: why does EasitTestOauthDatastore.js contain an entry in credentialClientTokens?
2015-11-09T18:43:40 <cindyli> simonjb: i saw there\'s some default entries for auth decisions, so i added one for the first discovery. without this default, a new token should be generated
2015-11-09T18:44:07 <cindyli> simonjb: if you think it\'s unnecessary to have the default, i can remove it
2015-11-09T18:44:08 <jhung> anastasiac: Ok. I\'m going to take a look at that 404 issue.
2015-11-09T18:45:24 <simonjb> cindyli: ah ok, the defaults for authDecisions were for particular tests cases for the review last year (mostly) -- in this case I don\'t think we want to have an entry here -- I\'ll add a comment to the pull request to remove -- thanks!
