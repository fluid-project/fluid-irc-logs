2015-02-10T17:23:02 <colinclark> oh, jhung, do you think I should demo anything related to your ePub work?
2015-02-10T17:25:38 <jhung> colinclark: possibly. Let me check the status in Chrome + Readium.
2015-02-10T17:25:44 <colinclark> ok
2015-02-10T17:27:43 <Justin_o> anastasiac: seems that jhung and I have left comments on your pull requests

2015-02-10T18:17:07 <Justin_o> cindyli: is there a way to know when the panel a panel has been opened?
2015-02-10T18:18:45 <cindyli> Justin_o: the panel opens at the model change on currentPanelNum
2015-02-10T18:27:30 <anastasiac> jhung, I\xe2\x80\x99ve responded to your comments on the fluidproject.org pull request.

2015-02-10T18:31:07 <anastasiac> jhung danaayotte: the checkmark still has the huge space around it :-(
2015-02-10T18:31:33 <danaayotte> anastasiac aahhhhhhhhhhhh!
2015-02-10T18:31:36 <danaayotte> ok
2015-02-10T18:31:41 <anastasiac> indeed
2015-02-10T18:31:42 <danaayotte> we'll figure this out!
2015-02-10T18:31:49 <anastasiac> very, very strange...
2015-02-10T18:35:59 <danaayotte> i am recreating it from scratch anastasiac, will send you the updated in a few minutes

2015-02-10T18:46:04 <danaayotte> whaaaaaaaaaaat
2015-02-10T18:46:07 <danaayotte> it is haunted
2015-02-10T18:46:46 <anastasiac> danaayotte, has jhung tried generating it?
2015-02-10T18:46:51 <danaayotte> unless\xe2\x80\xa6could it be that it is still accessing the old one?
2015-02-10T18:47:20 <anastasiac> do you mean my browser? I\xe2\x80\x99ve tried quitting, clearing caches, changing the icon...
2015-02-10T18:47:30 <danaayotte> yes that's what i meant
2015-02-10T18:47:38 <danaayotte> jhung and i walked through it together, but perhaps jon, you can give it a try?
2015-02-10T18:48:29 <danaayotte> oops he's gone
2015-02-10T18:51:30 <anastasiac> danaayotte, what tool are you using to create things - could I maybe try it here?
2015-02-10T18:51:44 * jhung joined the channel
2015-02-10T18:51:56 <danaayotte> ah hello jhung
2015-02-10T18:52:05 <jhung> hi danaayotte
2015-02-10T18:52:12 <danaayotte> i re-created that icon from scratch and we're still having problems
2015-02-10T18:52:20 <danaayotte> wondered if you could give it a try
2015-02-10T18:53:26 <jhung> Sure danaayotte. I can take a look once I finish the thing I'm working on for Colinclark's presentation.
2015-02-10T18:53:34 <danaayotte> for sure, thanks
2015-02-10T18:53:45 <danaayotte> the Illustrator file is here https://www.dropbox.com/s/p6eog2bz3q4kkfu/First%20Discovery%20font%20icons.pdf?dl=0
2015-02-10T18:54:06 <danaayotte> anastasiac to answer your question i'm using Icomoon
2015-02-10T18:55:28 <anastasiac> danaayotte, looking at that illustrator file, the check mark looks smaller than everything else (e.g. smaller than the globe). Could you try making it larger, say the same size as the globe? It is pretty small when I try to render it
2015-02-10T18:56:27 <danaayotte> sure, i sized them relative to each other
2015-02-10T18:57:02 <jhung> Sepideh: I sent you an email with updated use case text for the presentation.
2015-02-10T18:57:12 <jhung> *use case scenario
2015-02-10T18:57:35 <Sepideh> jhung, thanks a lot. I got the email
2015-02-10T18:57:52 <danaayotte> anastasiac, what do you want from me - the original svg files?
2015-02-10T18:58:39 <anastasiac> danaayotte, perhaps you could just try enlarging the checkmark to be the same size as the other circular things and see if that helps
2015-02-10T19:01:48 <danaayotte> anastasiac: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/5ocghm2o8di4asu/AAD3ZLCDMQzUdNuq-xza5gxDa?dl=0
2015-02-10T19:03:36 <Justin_o> cindyli: can the prefsEditorLoader load a messageBundle to use itself
2015-02-10T19:03:38 <Justin_o> ?
2015-02-10T19:04:19 <cindyli> i think the prefsEditorLoader already has the messageBundle attached to itself
2015-02-10T19:04:20 <anastasiac> danaayotte: we\xe2\x80\x99re on the right track! the checkmark is larger and the empty space is smaller. I think if you make the checkmark just the right amount bigger it will work! I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure how we know how much bigger, though...
2015-02-10T19:04:46 <danaayotte> omg
2015-02-10T19:04:48 <danaayotte> ok
2015-02-10T19:11:02 <danaayotte> ok, try it again anastasiac

2015-02-10T19:16:01 <danaayotte> ok

2015-02-10T16:41:51 <clown> jhernandez, I also ran a version of the system with the "production" DR, and it worked as expected.
2015-02-10T16:42:10 <clown> so, all looks good here (F21 in a VBox).
2015-02-10T16:53:20 <jhernandez> clown: cool!

2015-02-10T16:59:39 <clown> jhernandez, I remember that from last week\'s arch meeting.  I wasn\'t clear how to do the test.
2015-02-10T16:59:57 <jhung> good catch colinclark. We have a pull req that we can add that fix.
2015-02-10T17:00:04 <colinclark> cool
2015-02-10T17:00:05 <jhung> proper url should be http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/inlineEdit/

2015-02-10T17:04:56 <jhernandez> clown: as far as I understand and after reading our testing infrastructure, we should add mocks of "real" device reporters to be able to pass/fail according to the requirements of a solution

2015-02-10T17:06:02 <clown> *resporters
2015-02-10T17:06:14 <clown> let me try that again...
2015-02-10T17:06:24 <jhernandez> you can do it!!!
2015-02-10T17:06:25 <clown> I\'m boggling at "mocks of \'real\' device reporters".
2015-02-10T17:06:26 <jhernandez> xD
2015-02-10T17:06:37 <clown> I did it !!!
2015-02-10T17:06:46 <jhernandez> good job!
2015-02-10T17:06:47 <jhernandez> :)
2015-02-10T17:07:10 <danaayotte> anastasiac, updated first discovery font icons are here https://www.dropbox.com/sh/5ocghm2o8di4asu/AAD3ZLCDMQzUdNuq-xza5gxDa?dl=0
2015-02-10T17:07:23 <danaayotte> was trying to think if there was a quick and easy way i could test it out myself...
2015-02-10T17:07:51 <danaayotte> i added the left arrow and hopefully fixed the checkmark
2015-02-10T17:08:07 <jhernandez> clown: yeah, in our testing framework we mock the settings handlers in order to be able to run every platforms\' tests
2015-02-10T17:08:15 <anastasiac> thanks, danaayotte, I\xe2\x80\x99ll have a look this afternoon
2015-02-10T17:08:17 <clown> back to "we don\'t have a test which apparently passes because no attempt is made to configure the solution because it is not installed"  \xe2\x80\x94 the test should fail if the DR "reports" no installed solution.
2015-02-10T17:11:02 <jhernandez> clown: from that Bosmon7 statement, I\'m sticking with "the test should fail if the DR  "reports" no installed solution
2015-02-10T17:13:33 <clown> jhernandez:  that\'s my interpretation.
2015-02-10T17:14:28 <colinclark> oh hey jhung
2015-02-10T17:14:39 <colinclark> if I want to do a quick demo of the PhET sim you\'ve been working...
2015-02-10T17:14:43 <colinclark> which URL should I use?
2015-02-10T17:15:01 <colinclark> and do you want me to show them any wireframes or concept sketches or anything?
2015-02-10T17:15:35 <jhernandez> clown: well, AFAIK (and if I\'m not wrong), we\'re already defining the expected output in the test, so it\'ll actually fail if the result differs from it
2015-02-10T17:17:00 <jhernandez> what I\'ve done until now, is to add a new test suite and a new few config files in order to tell the test suite to use the dynamic device reporter
2015-02-10T17:17:50 <jhernandez> now I have to leave - cours de fran\xc3\xa7ais
2015-02-10T17:18:03 <clown> tres bien, jhernandez
2015-02-10T17:18:34 <jhernandez> but tonight I\'ll push what I already have to github
2015-02-10T17:18:48 <jhung> colinclark: sure. I can send you a PDF of the last design. I\'m sure Sam has a version of the sim that is keyboard accessible. You may need to ask him for an URL.
2015-02-10T17:18:58 <clown> which means, later this afternoon for me.
2015-02-10T17:19:08 <jhernandez> clown: yeah :)
2015-02-10T17:19:14 <colinclark> Can you send him a quick note for me, jhung? I\'m not sure how much longer I\'ll have connectivity
2015-02-10T17:19:15 <clown> same "udpate" branch, jhernandez?
2015-02-10T17:19:19 <clown> gahh.
2015-02-10T17:19:22 <clown> "update".
2015-02-10T17:19:26 <jhung> ok colinclark
2015-02-10T17:19:30 <jhernandez> and I\'ll probably ask Bosmon7 for some help
2015-02-10T17:19:35 <colinclark> thanks, sorry to inconvenience you, jhung
2015-02-10T17:20:25 <jhernandez> clown: nope, -update branches were for the big merge, everything is in my device-reporter-draft-2 branches now
2015-02-10T17:20:53 <clown> oh, okay.  I\'ll pull from them to get up-to-date
