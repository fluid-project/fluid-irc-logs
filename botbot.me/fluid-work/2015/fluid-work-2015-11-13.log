b'2015-11-13T18:44:34 <alanharnum> does flocking-min remove those?
2015-11-13T18:44:38 <colinclark> no
2015-11-13T18:44:44 <colinclark> it\'s just minified
2015-11-13T18:44:50 <colinclark> there is a flocking-base build
2015-11-13T18:44:57 <colinclark> I believe, however, that it contains no unit generators
2015-11-13T18:45:00 <colinclark> which is actually find
2015-11-13T18:45:02 <colinclark> fine
2015-11-13T18:45:22 <colinclark> the point of flocking base was to have a file with only the absolute core of Flocking, and then you can include the ugen files you actually need
2015-11-13T18:45:31 <colinclark> I\'ll see if I can assemble a more useful profile for us
2015-11-13T18:46:17 <colinclark> Bosmon: This is another reminder that we really want, for the web, modules that can build themselves to a specification at install time
2015-11-13T18:46:45 <Bosmon> Yes
2015-11-13T18:46:52 <colinclark> alanharnum should be able to say, via his npm package.json file, "I want Flocking, consisting of the following profile of it"
2015-11-13T18:46:59 * slim_ has quit
2015-11-13T18:47:06 <Bosmon> We are probably going to have the bite the bullet and go with the browserify + source maps approach
2015-11-13T18:47:18 <colinclark> I think we probably want something like that anyway
2015-11-13T18:47:26 <colinclark> When I was debugging alanharnum\'s code in Firefox
2015-11-13T18:47:39 <colinclark> for whatever reason, the debugger just refused to show me flocking-all.js
2015-11-13T18:47:42 <colinclark> perhaps it was too big
2015-11-13T18:47:48 <colinclark> but as you know, debugging concatenated files sucks
2015-11-13T18:48:06 <colinclark> and I was really wishing for some "mode" where I could just flip between individual files and a built file
2015-11-13T18:48:17 <colinclark> I have no idea if a fancier toolchain will offer us such flexibility
2015-11-13T18:48:56 <colinclark> alanharnum: there is just no Flocking build that does what we want!
2015-11-13T18:49:02 <colinclark> Even flocking-base includes jQuery and Infusion
2015-11-13T18:49:11 <colinclark> I guess I will create another even slimmer profile
2015-11-13T19:01:57 <colinclark> alanharnum: SUCCESS
2015-11-13T19:02:21 <alanharnum> colinclark: bug fixed?
2015-11-13T19:02:25 <colinclark> yup
2015-11-13T19:02:35 <alanharnum> yaaaay
2015-11-13T19:03:38 <colinclark> I\'ll push up my chanages
2015-11-13T19:03:41 <colinclark> changes
2015-11-13T19:03:51 <alanharnum> awesome
2015-11-13T19:03:53 <colinclark> and then I should go pack for D.C. for a bit
2015-11-13T19:04:24 <alanharnum> i will hopefully be able to take it from here, thanks a lot
2015-11-13T19:04:43 <colinclark> I\'ve added a TODO comment to your monster playSonification function
2015-11-13T19:04:48 <colinclark> I\'m assuming you\'ll refactor it
2015-11-13T19:05:05 <colinclark> but the one thing we\'ll want to do to be nice is stop the environment after we\'re finished playing all our beeps
2015-11-13T19:05:15 <colinclark> which will involve some reworking of your scheduling code, but not much
2015-11-13T19:05:29 <colinclark> just schedule a call to enviro.stop() after your last sequence has played
2015-11-13T19:06:48 <alanharnum> colinclark: yeah i\'m going to extensively refactor this
2015-11-13T19:06:54 <alanharnum> i\'ll make sure it stops the environment
2015-11-13T19:07:05 <alanharnum> having now seen first-hand that web audio can mess up your whole computer\'s audio system :)
2015-11-13T19:09:04 <colinclark> :)
2015-11-13T19:09:08 <alanharnum> colinclark: working - pushing up a demo shortly
2015-11-13T19:09:20 <colinclark> alanharnum: Not so much web audio as lazy web audio developers :)
2015-11-13T19:09:32 <colinclark> I\'ve made a pull request to your repository with my changes
2015-11-13T19:10:07 <colinclark> The funny thing is that I suspect Flocking\'s rather awkward declarative scheduling functionality would be perfect for this tool
2015-11-13T19:10:39 <colinclark> since you know all your timings up front, you\'d just generate a "score" object, hand it off to the scheduler component\'s options, and be done with it
2015-11-13T19:10:49 <colinclark> but I think it\'s too complex in practice
2015-11-13T19:10:49 <alanharnum> very likely - that will probably be part of my refactoring
2015-11-13T19:11:01 <colinclark> You can certainly try it
2015-11-13T19:11:08 <colinclark> but it\'s a complex API, which even I continually forget how it works
2015-11-13T19:11:17 <colinclark> and I\'m certain I will break the API in the next six months
2015-11-13T19:11:31 <colinclark> the use of flock.modelSynth pushes pretty hard on the scheduling idiom in Flocking
2015-11-13T19:11:37 <colinclark> as Bosmon predicted back when I wrote the Flocking paper
2015-11-13T19:11:51 <alanharnum> colinclark: does flocking-base include the gh-137 fix?
2015-11-13T19:11:58 <colinclark> yes, it does
2015-11-13T19:12:01 <alanharnum> ok cool
2015-11-13T19:12:08 <colinclark> I updated all the requisite files in my pull request to you
2015-11-13T19:12:38 <colinclark> Given the low performance requirements of your synth, alanharnum, I think what we really want from the perspective of FLOE is a model-aware scheduler
2015-11-13T19:12:45 <colinclark> which is what Bergson, in time, will provide
2015-11-13T19:13:05 <colinclark> it may not be suitable for a musician doing very complex, high-performance scheduling on the fly
2015-11-13T19:13:07 * slim_ joined the channel
2015-11-13T19:13:10 <colinclark> but in this case, we\'re really not far away
2015-11-13T19:13:34 <colinclark> what we want is a kind of "score action" that just contains Change Applier change specifications
2015-11-13T19:13:57 <colinclark> I think post-IBM I\'ll work a bit on that so we can vastly simplify your code for scheduling stuf
2015-11-13T19:15:05 <alanharnum> colinclark: i may hack on it as well
2015-11-13T19:15:28 <alanharnum> i have a better understanding of how flocking works now in terms of the "make sounds happen" aspect
2015-11-13T19:15:48 <alanharnum> you\'d basically want to extend the model-relay synth concept to the scheduler
2015-11-13T19:16:18 <alanharnum> so you tell a scheduler "listen and change yourself based on this model, then change your synths"
2015-11-13T19:16:52 * clown joined the channel
2015-11-13T19:34:39 * slim_ has quit
2015-11-13T19:45:02 <alanharnum> super-crude and only works in Chrome (working on making the voice synthesis not break browsers that don\'t support it): https://rawgit.com/waharnum/chartAuthoring/FLOE-437/demos/index.html
2015-11-13T19:45:10 <alanharnum> however, it sonifies data
2015-11-13T19:45:28 <alanharnum> ^ colinclark sepidedshahi in particular
2015-11-13T19:46:01 <alanharnum> (they\'re hard to see, but there\'s little play/pause text right above the pie - hit the "play" one to sonify the current data)
2015-11-13T19:46:03 <colinclark> zomg, alanharnum
2015-11-13T19:46:37 <colinclark> zomg zomg zomg
2015-11-13T19:46:40 <colinclark> this is so exciting
2015-11-13T19:47:27 <alanharnum> yeah it\'s pretty cool
2015-11-13T19:47:41 <colinclark> beep beep beep beep bip bip bip bip bip
2015-11-13T19:47:44 <alanharnum> the sonifier code is a bit of a spaghetti mess, but it gives me something to refactor on the plane to vancouver
2015-11-13T19:47:54 <colinclark> yup
2015-11-13T19:48:20 <michelled> wow! It reads my cats names very well :)
2015-11-13T19:48:49 <colinclark> Arthur. beep beep beep beep bip bip bip bip bip bip
2015-11-13T19:49:29 <colinclark> oh hey alanharnum
2015-11-13T19:49:37 <colinclark> something occurred to me last night while on the subway
2015-11-13T19:50:02 <colinclark> I believe the zoom factor feature is in fact trivial to implement, even with the current synth design
2015-11-13T19:50:19 <colinclark> essentially every unit generator in Flocking has two inputs that scale the signal
2015-11-13T19:50:23 <colinclark> "mul" and "add"
2015-11-13T19:50:43 <alanharnum> i think the next thing i want to do is sequence the voice labels better
2015-11-13T19:50:53 <colinclark> yes, definitely
2015-11-13T19:50:55 <alanharnum> interesting
2015-11-13T19:51:14 <alanharnum> for the voice i think i need to do some math with exactly how long each sonified piece of data is
2015-11-13T19:51:29 <alanharnum> i\'ve got long pauses / occasional overlap right now
2015-11-13T19:51:34 <colinclark> yeah
2015-11-13T19:52:12 <colinclark> Actually, I might be wrong about the scaling, as I think about it some more
2015-11-13T19:52:17 <colinclark> but it\'s a trivial feature to implement
2015-11-13T19:52:28 <colinclark> since of course mul/add scale the output value of the unit generator
2015-11-13T19:52:31 <alanharnum> i think if we wanted to do the scaling the easiest thing would be to have a multiplier in sonifier.js
2015-11-13T19:52:36 <colinclark> and what we want to do is scale only the durations
2015-11-13T19:52:49 <colinclark> in other words, mul/add scale "values", but not "durations"
2015-11-13T19:52:52 <alanharnum> then we can just increase the durations appropriately
2015-11-13T19:53:02 <colinclark> yup, that\'s true too
2015-11-13T19:53:16 <colinclark> since you already programmatically generate those durations on the fly
2015-11-13T19:53:19 <colinclark> very good, yes
2015-11-13T19:54:03 <alanharnum> yeah it would be straightforward to have a configurable variable that would speed it up or slow it down by changing the base durations of the notes / pauses
2015-11-13T19:54:16 <alanharnum> at least when i think about it in my head, which isn\'t necessarily a good guide
2015-11-13T19:55:49 <colinclark> that\'s correct, yes
2015-11-13T19:55:57 <colinclark> an option to your component
2015-11-13T19:56:10 * alanharnum turns the midi notes way down
2015-11-13T19:56:30 <colinclark> alanharnum you should use the subwoofer in my office :P

2015-11-13T16:11:11 <Bosmon> Hi there gtirloni - I\'ve committed a somewhat plausible version of the production config to my branch now: https://github.com/amb26/universal/blob/GPII-1318/gpii/node_modules/preferencesServer/configs/gpii.preferencesServer.config.production.json
2015-11-13T16:11:26 <Bosmon> At least, I see it attempting to contact the couch server when I send requests to it
2015-11-13T16:15:01 * colinclark joined the channel
2015-11-13T16:16:27 <Bosmon> Hi there simonjb - do you have time for a quick question about the untrusted FM work?
2015-11-13T16:17:45 <simonjb> yes, definitely Bosmon
2015-11-13T16:18:12 <Bosmon> So I\'m a bit puzzled about the inheritance structure around the login handler -
2015-11-13T16:18:13 <Bosmon> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/src/UntrustedFlowManager.js#L92
2015-11-13T16:18:27 <Bosmon> So this says that the request is a gpii.request.flowManager.untrusted.stateChangeHandler
2015-11-13T16:18:45 <Bosmon> Which is listed just above at https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/src/UntrustedFlowManager.js#L60
2015-11-13T16:18:58 <Bosmon> Now the only base grade of this is gpii.request.flowManager.userLogonStateChange.stateChangeHandler
2015-11-13T16:19:07 <simonjb> yes
2015-11-13T16:19:22 <Bosmon> Which is here: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/src/UserLogonStateChange.js#L106
2015-11-13T16:19:58 <Bosmon> Now on line 85 https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/src/UntrustedFlowManager.js#L85 we register a listener firing to {that}.getDeviceContext
2015-11-13T16:20:11 <Bosmon> But I don\'t see that we have any method like this....
2015-11-13T16:20:58 <Bosmon> Oh wait
2015-11-13T16:21:01 <Bosmon> Am I completely mad?
2015-11-13T16:21:04 <Bosmon> Is it right here under my nose?
2015-11-13T16:21:17 <simonjb> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/src/UserLogonStateChange.js#L114
2015-11-13T16:21:21 <Bosmon> Yes
2015-11-13T16:21:23 <Bosmon> I am sorry
2015-11-13T16:21:27 <Bosmon> I am going completely mad
2015-11-13T16:22:05 <simonjb> no problem, the Flow Manager grades, I think, have gotten a little out of hand
2015-11-13T16:22:34 <simonjb> it would be worthwhile to spend a bit more time reorganizing

2015-11-13T17:06:51 <simonjb> thanks colinclark :)
2015-11-13T17:07:25 <colinclark> alanharnum: Anything I can do to help with the sonification work? It sounds like you were making good progress this morning.
2015-11-13T17:07:34 <alanharnum> colinclark: yeah i\'m actually quite close
2015-11-13T17:07:38 <colinclark> nice!
2015-11-13T17:07:53 <alanharnum> colinclark: I think if you have a look & tell me what i\'m doing wrong with the scheduler, we\'ll have working sonification
2015-11-13T17:07:58 <colinclark> sure
2015-11-13T17:07:59 <alanharnum> it\'s probably something very basic
2015-11-13T17:08:21 <alanharnum> https://github.com/waharnum/chartAuthoring/tree/FLOE-437
2015-11-13T17:08:44 <alanharnum> if you clone / fork that and look at tests/html/sonifier-tests.html
2015-11-13T17:09:02 <colinclark> yup, let me just fetch your changes
2015-11-13T17:09:18 <alanharnum> basically, it schedules the model change (at 0, for initialize), plays the first piece of data, then doesn\'t play the others
2015-11-13T17:09:45 <alanharnum> i can see from logging that the scheduling is working (the function runs), and there\'s a little "pop" when the listener happens, but no sound
2015-11-13T17:11:09 <colinclark> Ok, let\'s have a look
2015-11-13T17:13:18 <colinclark> wow, unit tests that make sounds
2015-11-13T17:13:34 <alanharnum> yes, althought not currently testing it\'s making the right sound :)
2015-11-13T17:14:49 <alanharnum> the other thing i\'m seeing if it helps - I played around with the voice synthesis a little and it doesn\'t speak the second time it goes into a scheduler change either
2015-11-13T17:14:59 <alanharnum> so i think my logic may be doing something that turns off the sound completely
2015-11-13T17:15:15 <alanharnum> and then doesn\'t re-enable it
2015-11-13T17:15:18 <alanharnum> if that makes any sense
2015-11-13T17:18:43 <alanharnum> ok i think that\'s what\'s happening - i took out the applier block at 232-235 and speech synthesis will now function each time it goes through
2015-11-13T17:19:06 <alanharnum> this hopefully makes more sense to you than it does to me :(
2015-11-13T17:19:17 <colinclark> It possibly means we\'re outputting invalid values...
2015-11-13T17:19:28 <colinclark> in some browsers, output NaN to the audio system will mute EVERYTHING
2015-11-13T17:19:42 <alanharnum> interesting
2015-11-13T17:22:01 <alanharnum> i suspect that\'s what\'s happening, as I think I just nuked my audio running this in Firefox :)
2015-11-13T17:23:54 <alanharnum> hm
2015-11-13T17:24:07 <alanharnum> do i need to synchronize the appliers somehow?
2015-11-13T17:24:10 <colinclark> So the first thing I\'ve done, alanharnum, is to ditch the default model of your synths
2015-11-13T17:24:21 <colinclark> since you were cutting yourself off :)
2015-11-13T17:24:36 <colinclark> that gets rid of the glitch at the start
2015-11-13T17:33:55 <alanharnum> ok - easily done
2015-11-13T17:34:23 <colinclark> yes, we have some NaN action here
2015-11-13T17:34:27 <colinclark> let\'s fine out why
2015-11-13T17:34:39 <alanharnum> i don\'t think either of the pieces of data is outputting any NaN - both will play successfully if you run them through individually
2015-11-13T17:35:06 <colinclark> I wrapped the envelopeSequencer in a flock.ugen.print unit generator
2015-11-13T17:35:12 <colinclark> which just outputs its values to the console
2015-11-13T17:35:16 <alanharnum> oh useful
2015-11-13T17:35:32 <colinclark> As I say--party like it\'s 1962
2015-11-13T17:35:40 <colinclark> and it\'s definitely outputting NaN
2015-11-13T17:37:05 <alanharnum> hm
2015-11-13T17:37:12 <colinclark> I think I will try to write a test case for this :)
2015-11-13T17:37:33 <alanharnum> is it just outputting nothing but NaN, or as the last part of an array or similar?
2015-11-13T17:38:21 <alanharnum> i don\'t think the sonifier code is passing anything other than arrays of numbers
2015-11-13T17:38:28 <colinclark> Here\'s the output, with flock.ugen.print running at 1 Hz: http://pastie.org/10555112
2015-11-13T17:38:49 <colinclark> You can see that, I assume, after we set the second set of duration/values, we\'re outputting NaN
2015-11-13T17:38:58 <colinclark> alanharnum: It\'s probably a bug in the sequencer unit generator
2015-11-13T17:38:59 <alanharnum> yeah
2015-11-13T17:39:20 <colinclark> Is it easy for you to paste me the two sets of envelope arrays?
2015-11-13T17:39:24 <alanharnum> yup
2015-11-13T17:39:27 <colinclark> thanks
2015-11-13T17:39:37 <alanharnum> i\'ve got them written out in full in the test code, actually
2015-11-13T17:39:44 <colinclark> ah, ok
2015-11-13T17:39:45 <colinclark> where?
2015-11-13T17:39:59 <alanharnum> if you look at 36-66 of sonifierTests.js
2015-11-13T17:40:42 <colinclark> ok, cool
2015-11-13T17:41:24 <alanharnum> i am going to go grab some lunch quickly
2015-11-13T17:41:29 <alanharnum> thanks for help colinclark
2015-11-13T17:41:36 <alanharnum> it\'s very close!
2015-11-13T17:41:54 <colinclark> yup, no problem
2015-11-13T17:55:33 * amatas has quit
2015-11-13T17:58:19 <colinclark> alanharnum: It\'s a rookie mistake (on my part). I don\'t correctly reset the current index into the value/duration arrays when they are changed. So changing those arrays from a longer length to a shorter length is likely to cause exactly this kind of error.
2015-11-13T17:58:30 <colinclark> I will fix it up for you asap
2015-11-13T18:00:11 <alanharnum> colinclark: awesome thanks
2015-11-13T18:00:34 <alanharnum> and then we should have a working sonifier (albeit one badly in need of refactoring)
2015-11-13T18:06:27 <colinclark> alanharnum: Here\'s the ticket https://github.com/colinbdclark/Flocking/issues/137
2015-11-13T18:06:34 <colinclark> tests and fix on its way
2015-11-13T18:09:16 <alanharnum> colinclark: you probably don\'t need the confirmation, but i tried reversing the array before passing it in and it works, so that\'s proof positive this is the issue
2015-11-13T18:09:25 <colinclark> Great
2015-11-13T18:09:33 <colinclark> It\'s good to know I\'m not crazy :)
2015-11-13T18:09:37 <alanharnum> shorter -> longer array sequence works, basically
2015-11-13T18:09:41 <colinclark> yeah
2015-11-13T18:09:46 <colinclark> As I say, rookie bug
2015-11-13T18:10:12 <colinclark> I really need to be more diligent about programming for errors, rather than success :)
2015-11-13T18:10:35 <alanharnum> i think we have the same tendency :P
2015-11-13T18:10:43 * jhung joined the channel
2015-11-13T18:11:04 <alanharnum> i think my git hook to run my linter and require 0 linter errors before i can commit has saved me, at this point, something like 100+ inadverent commits of code with linter errors :P
2015-11-13T18:12:05 <colinclark> I suspect simonjb could teach us a lot about coding with care in these situations
2015-11-13T18:12:31 <alanharnum> it\'s why TDD is good practice for me
2015-11-13T18:12:36 <colinclark> yeah
2015-11-13T18:12:38 <colinclark> tests help a lot
2015-11-13T18:12:40 <alanharnum> it\'s antidote to my personal bad habits
2015-11-13T18:12:43 <colinclark> but the key is you really need a ton of them
2015-11-13T18:13:12 <colinclark> I remember michelled was also very good, when pair programming, at pointing out all the tests we hadn\'t written in regards to edge cases and errors
2015-11-13T18:13:25 <colinclark> my impression is that you really need more than JUST test cases
2015-11-13T18:13:44 <alanharnum> i definitely like the auto-running linter
2015-11-13T18:13:47 <colinclark> you need a mentality for programming that includes thinking about these issues
2015-11-13T18:13:54 <alanharnum> i need to find more stuff like that
2015-11-13T18:14:07 <alanharnum> can\'t automate away all my bad habits, but it certainly helps
2015-11-13T18:18:58 <gtirloni> Bosmon: sorry for the delay, juggling many things in the air here. that config worked and some quick tests here do _not_ show the memory issue we experienced last time, this is awesome. plus on my slow-ish i5 processor, i\'m getting 50% better single-process response then the server\'s time.. this is looking really good so far :)
2015-11-13T18:20:29 <Bosmon> gtirloni - that\'s fantastic!

2015-11-13T18:43:53 <alanharnum> ?
2015-11-13T18:44:00 <colinclark> we are currently including two instances of Infusion and jQuery and other shared dependencies in the chart authoring tool
2015-11-13T18:44:07 <colinclark> I\'m impressed that it all worked out
2015-11-13T18:44:21 <colinclark> flocking-all.js is, well, all :)
2015-11-13T18:44:24 <alanharnum> colinclark: ah due to flocking including them :)
2015-11-13T18:44:27 <colinclark> yeah

2015-11-13T11:02:06 <gtirloni> Bosmon: hi! this is the error i\'m getting: http://pastie.org/pastes/10554460/text?key=gquyykw7guniakokzdypqq
2015-11-13T11:11:54 <Bosmon> gtirloni - thanks - will resolve shortly
2015-11-13T11:48:18 <Bosmon> Ok gtirloni - please update to the latest tip of my branch: https://github.com/amb26/kettle/tree/KETTLE-32
2015-11-13T11:49:04 <Bosmon> I\'m puzzled that you were even getting that error since in any earlier version of my branch I had destroyed kettle\'s init.js file
2015-11-13T11:49:10 <Bosmon> I guess you weren\'t actually testing my branch at all
2015-11-13T11:49:26 <Bosmon> Anyway, i) note that init.js is now at top level inside kettle, so here is the command line I used:
2015-11-13T11:49:38 <Bosmon> node node_modules/kettle/init.js E:/source/gits/gpii/node_modules/universal/gpii/node_modules/preferencesServer/configs
2015-11-13T11:50:20 <Bosmon> Also ii) I have removed the ridiculous system where NODE_ENV defaults to "development" - you have to supply the config name explicitly either in NODE_ENV or as the 3rd argument to node with init.js
2015-11-13T11:50:35 <Bosmon> Also iii) All the config files have changed names, they are now properly globally qualified names
2015-11-13T11:50:59 <Bosmon> So what I had was this: export NODE_ENV=gpii.preferencesServer.config.development
2015-11-13T11:51:35 <Bosmon> And what you should see looks like this: http://pastie.org/10554552
2015-11-13T11:52:33 <Bosmon> gtirloni - sorry I pasted you the wrong branch
2015-11-13T11:53:35 <Bosmon> Clearly I meant a GPII branch, this one: https://github.com/amb26/universal/tree/GPII-1318#
2015-11-13T11:53:37 <Bosmon> https://github.com/amb26/universal/tree/GPII-1318
2015-11-13T11:53:43 <Bosmon> Sorry for the #
2015-11-13T12:02:59 <gtirloni> Bosmon: I had the wrong repo URL so yeah, I wasn\'t even testing your branch, sorry.
2015-11-13T12:03:03 <gtirloni> and now it works :)
2015-11-13T12:03:06 <gtirloni> http://pastie.org/pastes/10554583/text
2015-11-13T12:03:25 <gtirloni> thanks!
2015-11-13T12:22:15 <Bosmon> gtirloni - awesome
2015-11-13T12:22:51 <Bosmon> I guess we should test the production branch in practice but this will be good enough for an initial shakedown of the testing process.....

2015-11-13T14:52:34 <Bosmon> Unfortunately I have not had the time to review his pull requests
2015-11-13T14:53:08 <Justin_o> Bosmon: that\'s the only thing I had found so far. Okay, I\'ll see if i can reuse that for validating my config object.
2015-11-13T14:53:18 <Bosmon> But this is some middleware in any case
2015-11-13T14:53:33 <Bosmon> You may just want to use the underlying library he preferred, "AJV"

2015-11-13T15:06:00 <Bosmon> ok
2015-11-13T15:06:30 <Bosmon> A bunch of "if" statements might be fine for now, since we might be in a bit of a hurry : P
2015-11-13T15:07:06 <Bosmon> I don\'t imagine this JSON file will have more than a couple of members?
2015-11-13T15:08:06 <Bosmon> Simply using AJV directly might be reasonable if the docs for driving it look good enough
2015-11-13T15:08:45 <Bosmon> Alternatively you might consider a snippet like the following: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/core/js/FluidIoC.js#L1071
2015-11-13T15:09:27 <Justin_o> Bosmon: currently I\'m expecting something like this
2015-11-13T15:10:53 <Justin_o> sorry, the tea kettle was calling
