2015-10-10T22:31:05 <sgithens> Hey team
2015-10-10T22:31:29 <sgithens> dumb question, but now that I\'m working on my ticket for the oct 15 deadline, on universal are we working off of master or the review4 branch?
2015-10-10T22:33:27 <Bosmon> sgithens - well, surely that depends who "we" are : P
2015-10-10T22:33:43 <Bosmon> But really the review4 branch consists mostly of stuff that will be thrown away after the final review
2015-10-10T22:33:53 <Bosmon> If you expect anything to last, it will go in master
2015-10-10T22:34:00 <sgithens> IS Kasper merging everything from master into review4?
2015-10-10T22:34:28 <sgithens> OK, well I\'ll work off master since I assume all the other device reporter stuff is in there now
2015-10-10T22:34:36 <sgithens> and he can merge the work back in to review 4
2015-10-10T22:34:42 <sgithens> cheers
