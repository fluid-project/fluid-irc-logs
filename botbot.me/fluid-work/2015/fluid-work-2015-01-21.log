2015-01-21T17:52:25 <cindyli> michelled: yes, this jira was fixed by re-emphasizing links when toc is added onto the page. it's the toc component that detects the existence of the emphasize links enactor and calls for the re-application. however, if we have other dynamic content on the page, such as the overview panel or users' own dynamic content, those ones will need to do the same, which is probably not feasible
2015-01-21T17:53:22 <michelled> I'm ok with the change. I wish we could remember why we switched to this way, though.
2015-01-21T17:53:32 <michelled> hopefully if there's an issue we find it quickly
2015-01-21T17:55:24 <cindyli> ya

2015-01-21T16:03:26 <jhernandez> :P
2015-01-21T16:05:40 <jhernandez> wrt the bug you\'ve just filed ... could be a problem in yum\'s backend of packageKit?
2015-01-21T16:08:03 <clown> jhernandez:  Hi there!
2015-01-21T16:08:39 <clown> I am currently looking into packagekit bugs, email archives, etc. to see if where the change happened.
2015-01-21T16:08:54 <clown> Maybe it\'s a bug in packagekit itself?
2015-01-21T16:09:18 <clown> But, you have a point jhernandez.  It might be yum backend of (horrors) yum itself.
2015-01-21T16:09:34 <clown> *or (horrors) yum itself.
2015-01-21T16:11:13 <clown> jhernandez:  New release of packagekit just two days ago:  http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/packagekit/2015-January/026355.html
2015-01-21T16:11:28 <clown> however, I don\'t know if that\'s relevant to the bug I just filed.
2015-01-21T16:12:25 * kasparnet has quit
2015-01-21T16:14:48 <jhernandez> yeah, maybe it\'s worth to wait until the new release lands fedora
2015-01-21T16:19:05 <jhernandez> clown: https://github.com/hughsie/PackageKit/issues/21
2015-01-21T16:19:13 <jhernandez> maybe it\'a a matter of the appData file
2015-01-21T16:19:30 <jhernandez> (of the package we want to install)
2015-01-21T16:20:54 <clown> jhernandez:  From that issue:  "it\'s considered a settings application and thus needs AppData to show."
2015-01-21T16:21:06 <clown> I don\'t *think* that applies to "tuxguitar".

2015-01-21T16:53:09 <cindyli> anastasiac, Bosmon or Bosmon7, michelled, in prefs framework, if turn on the "emphasize links", reload the page, links in some dynamic content such as the overview panel won\'t be emphasized when the overview panel is rendered after the enactor performs its action. the cause of the issue is, we are finding all "a" links on the page and apply a styling to every link.
2015-01-21T16:53:12 * jhernandez has quit
2015-01-21T16:53:56 <cindyli> Justin_o and I were thinking we probably should switch to apply one styling to the entire container rather than every link
2015-01-21T16:54:48 <cindyli> however, we sort of rmb some years ago when I just started on UIO, this approach of "applying to the whole container" was used but we decided later to switch to grab links

2015-01-21T16:55:09 <cindyli> do any of you remember what\'s the reason that we made the change?
2015-01-21T16:55:24 * clown welcomes back jhernandez :-)
2015-01-21T17:04:22 <anastasiac> cindyli, I don\xe2\x80\x99t recall why we made the change. Are there any old closed JIRAs relating to it that might include helpful comments?
2015-01-21T17:04:34 <clown> kasparnet:  possibly dumb question:  is there an arch meeting today?
2015-01-21T17:05:14 <jhernandez> clown: no, right now we\'re being "EC-reviewed"
2015-01-21T17:05:33 <clown> jhernandez: thanks!
2015-01-21T17:07:15 <cindyli> anastasiac: unfortunately don\'t find any

2015-01-21T17:31:23 <michelled> cindyli: my recollection was that it had to do with specificity and the ease of integration
2015-01-21T17:31:54 <michelled> cindyli: perhaps you could try it and see how our demos behave?
2015-01-21T17:32:02 <michelled> particularly the in context demos
2015-01-21T17:33:23 <michelled> jhernandez: it\'s still going? I thought you\'d be done for the day
2015-01-21T17:36:17 <jhernandez> michelled: nope
2015-01-21T17:36:23 <jhernandez> still here :/
2015-01-21T17:36:39 <jhernandez> we\'re behind the schedule (as always)
2015-01-21T17:37:06 <michelled> :(
2015-01-21T17:37:17 <jhernandez> so we\'re all here against our willingness
2015-01-21T17:37:22 <jhernandez> :P
2015-01-21T17:37:40 <michelled> yes, I\'m sure your beds and beers are calling you
2015-01-21T17:37:56 <jhernandez> that\'s correct
2015-01-21T17:37:57 <jhernandez> :)
2015-01-21T17:38:41 <jhernandez> but since we skipped the CAS demo this morning, we still want to demo it

2015-01-21T17:44:17 <cindyli> michelled: i\'ve tried with the prefs framework demo and assorted content manual test, they are looking good
2015-01-21T17:45:35 <michelled> cindyli: did you see this JIRA? http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-4449
