2015-09-30T17:55:56 <avtar> i have a nodejs-couchdb skeleton project directory as well that could be used for unified-listing type apps
2015-09-30T17:56:17 <avtar> there's an issue with how the couchdb host's ip is exposed
2015-09-30T17:57:18 <avtar> for example, in a vm where couchdb will be running alongside the node process the address the app should use will most likely be 127.0.0.1
2015-09-30T17:57:50 <avtar> in a staging or production environment gtirloni will want to decide what that address is
2015-09-30T17:57:59 * simonjb joined the channel
2015-09-30T17:58:40 <avtar> is it reasonable to introduce an environment variable like COUCHDB_HOST_ADDRESS that the application should use as part of its config?
2015-09-30T17:59:33 <avtar> something like process.env.COUCHDB_HOST_ADDRESS would let the app work in a dev vm and where it ends up getting hosted

2015-09-30T19:04:02 <Bosmon> Hi there Justin_o - I noticed that a stray .DS_Store file got committed to infusion-docs with that last merge
2015-09-30T19:10:43 * cindyli joined the channel
2015-09-30T19:30:38 <colinclark> Probably worth updating https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/blob/master/.gitignore
2015-09-30T19:30:48 <colinclark> though I was under the impression that they were ignored by default
2015-09-30T19:39:47 * simonjb joined the channel
2015-09-30T19:49:16 <Justin_o> colinclark: usually they are in the global one

2015-09-30T20:16:05 <cindyli> simonjb: do you know how many characters are in a gpii token?
2015-09-30T20:18:34 <simonjb> cindyli: that's a very good question and I am not aware of a limit -- would you be able to check with kasper?
2015-09-30T20:18:57 <cindyli> sure. thanks, simonjb
2015-09-30T20:19:20 <simonjb> and let me know the answer, cindyli? please :)
2015-09-30T20:19:29 <cindyli> certainly, simonjb
2015-09-30T20:47:01 <colinclark> simonjb: There is no formal limit on GPII token size
2015-09-30T20:47:09 <colinclark> There may be practical limits
2015-09-30T20:47:12 <colinclark> but there is no standard as yet
2015-09-30T20:47:32 <colinclark> On the old MiFare tags that we support, the token can't be more than 1K
2015-09-30T20:47:35 <colinclark> since this is all the tag can store
2015-09-30T20:47:46 <colinclark> but the limit may well be even smaller based on how we use the tag
2015-09-30T20:47:58 <colinclark> on a USB stick, the token could be as large as the storage device
2015-09-30T20:49:53 <simonjb> thanks colinclark
2015-09-30T20:50:12 <colinclark> I assume it's something the big project may decide to mandate
2015-09-30T20:50:19 <colinclark> along with a proper token generator
2015-09-30T20:51:01 <simonjb> yeah, that makes sense

2015-09-30T16:22:16 <Justin_o> i think there was a change left
2015-09-30T16:22:46 <jhung> Justin_o: I think it was merged. I recall cindy had to make a change not long ago and I think the instructions in the Readme were sufficient.

2015-09-30T16:48:20 <jhung> also is it updated to the latest? I ran into a similar issue before and I recall updating docpad helped.
2015-09-30T16:48:31 <Justin_o> i just installed it
2015-09-30T16:48:43 <Justin_o> but is there a way to check if it is the latest
2015-09-30T16:50:29 <jhung> docpad -V Justin_o
2015-09-30T16:51:53 <jhung> try changing line 9 of package.json to     "docpad": "~6.78.3" Justin_o.
2015-09-30T16:52:03 <jhung> then run again

2015-09-30T17:19:38 <avtar> thanks
2015-09-30T17:32:12 <colinclark> avtar: Man, this document is great
2015-09-30T17:32:41 <colinclark> I really like your bullet points at the top--really tells me, as a developer, why I should be interested
2015-09-30T17:33:24 <avtar> thanks :) it went through several iterations until bullet points balance was achieved
2015-09-30T17:33:56 <avtar> i was hoping to get some input before i post it to the arch list
2015-09-30T17:34:25 <colinclark> my only feedback is a stylistic one
2015-09-30T17:34:28 <colinclark> and a very minor one
2015-09-30T17:34:46 <colinclark> "This repository contains content that can assist with provisioning development environments. The goal is to use deployment tools on virtual machines that will also be employed to set up build and test environments for the Prosperity4all Quality Infrastructure."
2015-09-30T17:34:54 <colinclark> I think this sentences could be written a bit more directly

Using these tools also ensures that the Prosperity4All Quality Infrastructure can automatically build and test your software."
2015-09-30T17:40:43 <colinclark> something like that
2015-09-30T17:40:51 <colinclark> probably can be even further tightened up
2015-09-30T17:41:09 <avtar> that looks pretty tight
2015-09-30T17:41:15 <colinclark> Is it correct?
2015-09-30T17:41:36 <colinclark> I guess the part about "consistent with the production deployment environment" raises curious questions
2015-09-30T17:41:42 <avtar> yes
2015-09-30T17:41:42 <colinclark> "Which production environment?"
2015-09-30T17:42:01 <avtar> wherever the same nodejs role is being used
2015-09-30T17:42:07 <colinclark> Maybe it\'s enough to just chop that part
2015-09-30T17:42:12 <colinclark> but I don\'t know
