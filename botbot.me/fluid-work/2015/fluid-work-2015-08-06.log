b'2015-08-06T18:36:36 <kasparnet> jesus -- still got it in me to ping you and totally miss your answers
2015-08-06T18:36:37 <kasparnet> sorry
2015-08-06T18:37:11 <kasparnet> I wanted to ask you about how to retrieve the flowmanager from within the test environment, but found an example of it in the contextintegration
2015-08-06T19:07:04 <Bosmon> cool :)

2015-08-06T21:16:29 <simonjb> hey Bosmon, are you available for a question?
2015-08-06T21:16:54 <Bosmon> Hey simonjb
2015-08-06T21:17:50 <simonjb> Bosmon: I\'ve been refactoring CloudBasedFlowManager.js so that I can test using browser-based testing
2015-08-06T21:18:20 <simonjb> I\'ve been pulling out the code that I want to test and putting into a separate file
2015-08-06T21:18:33 <simonjb> but I\'ve hit something that I\'m not sure how to handle
2015-08-06T21:18:35 <simonjb> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/src/CloudBasedFlowManager.js#L170
2015-08-06T21:18:45 <simonjb> a fluid.require for a json file
2015-08-06T21:18:51 <Bosmon> ah dear
2015-08-06T21:18:53 <Bosmon> How awkward
2015-08-06T21:19:09 <Bosmon> In so many ways : P
2015-08-06T21:21:16 <simonjb> any ideas on that to make this browser-friendly?
2015-08-06T21:22:06 <Bosmon> It\'s hard to think of a decent way out
2015-08-06T21:23:50 <simonjb> One idea: change to a JS file that assigns the object to a suitable global value
2015-08-06T21:24:26 <simonjb> then var suitableName = suitableName || require("...")
2015-08-06T21:24:44 <simonjb> then it isn\'t a JSON file
2015-08-06T21:24:49 <Bosmon> Yes
2015-08-06T21:24:57 <Bosmon> That seems like one of the slightly more awful ways out
2015-08-06T21:25:08 <Bosmon> Although this file isn\'t used as a proper "ontology" anyway
2015-08-06T21:25:52 <simonjb> I\'m open to suggestions on less awful ways out :)
2015-08-06T21:26:07 <Bosmon> Ok : P
2015-08-06T21:26:11 <Bosmon> How about this : P
2015-08-06T21:26:41 <Bosmon> Turn the "require" statement instead into an invocation of "a suitably named global function" which executes the require as it is
2015-08-06T21:28:00 <Bosmon> Then - move the blind references to these globals into arguments, which are supplied by the component which is orchestrating it
2015-08-06T21:28:22 <Bosmon> Then - bind invokers of that component onto the global function
2015-08-06T21:28:23 * anastasiac has quit
2015-08-06T21:28:38 <Bosmon> THen - monkey-patch the global function in your test driver so that it instead loads the same JSON file via synchronous AJAX ............
2015-08-06T21:29:03 * Bosmon is standing back to a safe distance
2015-08-06T21:29:23 <simonjb> yeah, that is definitely doable
2015-08-06T21:29:35 <simonjb> and it\'s reasonable to include AJAX in the test code?
2015-08-06T21:29:39 <alanharnum> based on my experience with ruby, anytime you use the word "monkey-patch" you\'re in for a good time & an excellent programming experience
2015-08-06T21:30:18 <Bosmon> simonjb - I think it\'s acceptable in a test driver, yes
2015-08-06T21:30:41 <Bosmon> simonjb - actually, no monkey-patching is necessary
2015-08-06T21:30:42 <simonjb> I think I can get away without the monkey-patching
2015-08-06T21:30:47 <Bosmon> I keep forgetting how the framework works :)
2015-08-06T21:30:57 <Bosmon> You can just override the invoker definition in the test driver arguments
2015-08-06T21:31:08 <simonjb> right
2015-08-06T21:31:27 <simonjb> or... just hit the functions directly with the suitable rule object
2015-08-06T21:31:34 <Bosmon> I was just momentarily pitched into complete desperation by the prospect of getting "fluid.require" to work in the browser
2015-08-06T21:31:49 <Bosmon> simonjb - sure - it depends on how your refactoring comes out for the test
2015-08-06T21:31:53 <simonjb> yeah
2015-08-06T21:32:00 <Bosmon> That is, whether it ends up splitting off a recognisable component or not
2015-08-06T21:32:04 <Bosmon> Hopefully it does : P
2015-08-06T21:32:05 <simonjb> but either way this seems doable
2015-08-06T21:32:08 <Bosmon> great
2015-08-06T21:32:16 <simonjb> thanks very much
2015-08-06T21:32:28 <Bosmon> Glad to help... after my momentary panic : P
2015-08-06T21:32:36 <Bosmon> There is a TODO on this dodgy construction in any case
2015-08-06T21:32:50 <Bosmon> So we may as well take the opportunity to clean up the idiom at the same time as improving the tests

2015-08-06T14:18:39 <Bosmon> colinclark - awesome!
2015-08-06T14:18:42 <Bosmon> Thanks so much
2015-08-06T14:18:53 <Bosmon> I\'ll convert it into a proper fix once this giant KEttle branch is ready
2015-08-06T14:18:54 <kasparnet> thank you so much, colinclark! Updating my GPII-641 pull accordingly as we speak (type)
2015-08-06T14:20:42 <Justin_o> Bosmon, cindyli: could you please take a look at this pull request from maozillah. I\'m wondering if you might have any thoughts on it before it gets merged in https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/618
2015-08-06T14:21:28 <colinclark> kasparnet: Anything else helpful I can do to make my morning feel full of accomplishments?
2015-08-06T14:21:42 <colinclark> Justin_o: How did it go with testing Bosmon\'s latest round of fixes for the giant framework pull?
2015-08-06T14:22:05 <Justin_o> colinclark: we\'re still working on that.. I need to recruit more people for that
2015-08-06T14:22:13 <colinclark> no worries, just curious
2015-08-06T14:22:16 <Justin_o> colinclark: so far i haven\'t found anything new though
2015-08-06T14:22:53 <colinclark> Sounds like we\'re getting close
2015-08-06T14:23:13 <colinclark> Bosmon: Can I get you to help me upgrade Flocking next week sometime?
2015-08-06T14:23:35 <Bosmon> colinclark - absolutely
2015-08-06T14:23:56 <Bosmon> Justin_o - thanks for the pointer to maozillah\'s pull - this seems interesting
2015-08-06T14:24:09 <colinclark> I think it\'s probably just the lingering demands blocks, which are a very simple case
2015-08-06T14:24:11 <Bosmon> Justin_o - can I try to make my guess about what this pull is, and you can tell me if I am right :)
2015-08-06T14:24:20 <Justin_o> Bosmon:  sure
2015-08-06T14:24:38 <Bosmon> Justin_o - it seems to me that "automate the test cases" refers to the fact that we had markup that was already present in standalone template files, that was duplicated in our test case markup - is this right?
2015-08-06T14:25:15 <Justin_o> Bosmon: essentially, although it was a bit worse, in that the markup in the tests were rather out of date
2015-08-06T14:25:15 * maozillah has quit
2015-08-06T14:25:23 <Bosmon> oh dear
2015-08-06T14:25:30 <Bosmon> The standard penalty of a cut n paster : p
2015-08-06T14:25:36 <Justin_o> yep
2015-08-06T14:26:40 <Justin_o> i figure these types of things will be easier with the async ginger world and maybe the new renderer but it\'s nice to have something in place between now and then, especially for such a key part of our framework/components
2015-08-06T14:26:55 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I think the pull looks pretty good - I guess there\'s no standard way with our current prefs framework for a panel to know what the default filename of its template is?
2015-08-06T14:26:59 <kasparnet> kasparnet: Not at the moment, but cheers for the offer
2015-08-06T14:27:28 <Bosmon> Justin_o - exactly, yes - whatever awkwardness we currently have with "resources" at the moment isn\'t worth spending too much more effort on since we plan to do away with it all
2015-08-06T14:27:30 <Justin_o> Bosmon: sadly no, because they expect to be getting them from the parent
2015-08-06T14:27:38 <Bosmon> Justin_o - ok, that\'s fine then
2015-08-06T14:27:44 <Bosmon> I think this pull request is as good as it can be
2015-08-06T14:28:38 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks :) glad to get your sign off on it. I\'ll probably merge it in soon, just waiting on a minor change to remove a comment and then will need to double check if it actually has to wait for the FLUID-5678 pull request.
2015-08-06T14:30:20 <colinclark> kasparnet mumbling to himself :)
2015-08-06T14:30:46 <kasparnet> hahaha, shit man
2015-08-06T14:32:00 <kasparnet> colinclark: was out for a really nice, but also quite late sail yesterday, and it ended up involving quite a few beers.. So am not at my sharpest today
2015-08-06T14:32:14 <colinclark> lol
2015-08-06T14:32:16 <colinclark> sounds amazing to me
2015-08-06T14:32:20 <kasparnet> it was
2015-08-06T14:32:26 <kasparnet> but more so yesterday than today :)
2015-08-06T14:32:29 <colinclark> I skipped sailing last night, sadly
2015-08-06T14:32:32 <colinclark> but the GPII wiki is better for it
2015-08-06T14:32:56 <kasparnet> both glad and sorry to hear that :)
2015-08-06T14:33:08 <kasparnet> will you have time to go out this weekend?
2015-08-06T14:33:27 <colinclark> Probably not--possibly on Sunday
2015-08-06T14:33:34 <colinclark> That poor boat has barely been sailed
2015-08-06T14:33:58 <colinclark> things are so busy with work and then trying to wrangle my thesis right now
2015-08-06T14:34:02 <colinclark> but soon enough :)
2015-08-06T14:34:59 <colinclark> Justin_o, cindyli: I wonder what it might mean logistically if we were to contribute the First Discovery Tool to the GPII?
2015-08-06T14:35:42 <colinclark> Would anything need to be done to it in order to do so?
2015-08-06T14:36:03 <Justin_o> colinclark: i guess it depends on how we do that.. the version of Infusion used in GPII for the UI right now is quite old compared to what is in First Discovery, unless it was changed recently.
2015-08-06T14:36:57 <colinclark> I was thinking maybe we wouldn\'t continue with the monolithic GPII prefsEditors repository...
2015-08-06T14:37:09 <colinclark> I think that was largely a kind of "teaching tool," if that makes sense
2015-08-06T14:37:15 <colinclark> but rather separate repositories per tool
2015-08-06T14:37:24 <colinclark> in that case, is there a versioning issue still?
2015-08-06T14:37:27 <Justin_o> colinclark: we\'d probably also have to change things up so that the first discovery could communicate with prefs server. And there were other things we didn\'t implement yet like a proper summary page
2015-08-06T14:38:02 <Justin_o> colinclark: no, i guess it would just be forking or moving it to the gpii space on github
2015-08-06T14:38:10 <colinclark> Justin_o: Yes, simonjb and Bosmon and I have been planning the security work required to support preferences editors using the Preferences Server. The actual work to do so will be done by IBM as part of PGA 3
2015-08-06T14:38:13 <Justin_o> and then the tying things together bit
2015-08-06T14:38:24 <colinclark> Bosmon: Do you see any complications in this regard?
2015-08-06T14:40:10 <Bosmon> colinclark - with which proposal specifically?
2015-08-06T14:40:59 <colinclark> Contributing the First Discovery Tool to the GPII org
2015-08-06T14:41:51 <Bosmon> colinclark - I guess we\'d run into a version of our standard problem relating to the mismatch of committer status between fluid and GPII
2015-08-06T14:43:05 <colinclark> It\'s probably something we can live with
2015-08-06T14:43:18 <colinclark> but I don\'t know for sure
2015-08-06T14:43:21 <Justin_o> Bosmon: that\'s interesting.. i wonder how we can fix that.. is the issue that there aren\'t enough people with push access to the GPII repos, or that there aren\'t enough that are familiar with Infusion components?
2015-08-06T14:44:08 <Bosmon> Justin_o - it\'s just that they are different people
2015-08-06T14:44:25 <Bosmon> For example, I don\'t think you and cindy would then have push access?
2015-08-06T14:44:30 <colinclark> that\'s right
2015-08-06T14:44:34 <colinclark> I think it\'s less an issue of experience
2015-08-06T14:44:53 <Justin_o> Bosmon:  i guess i mean that "they are different people" isn\'t necessarily a problem. If there is someone who could review our stuff and merge it as it\'s ready
2015-08-06T14:45:27 <colinclark> kasparnet, Bosmon, and I are all available to review and merge, especially when it\'s gone through a rigorous code review process already
2015-08-06T14:46:18 <Justin_o> I think that\'s okay, just don\'t all go vacation together :)
2015-08-06T14:48:19 <colinclark> lol
2015-08-06T15:08:44 <cindyli> Bosmon: when you have time, can u take a look at my early pull request that adds wrapper components for creating pie charts using d3 library - https://github.com/fluid-project/chartAuthoring/pull/4
2015-08-06T15:14:02 <cindyli> anastasiac: do you have a link to the tech doc for first discovery tool
2015-08-06T15:14:29 <anastasiac> cindyli, when you say \xe2\x80\x9cthe tech doc for first discovery tool\xe2\x80\x9d what do you mean?
2015-08-06T15:14:33 <anastasiac> the architecture report?
2015-08-06T15:14:36 <anastasiac> or something else?
2015-08-06T15:14:50 <cindyli> yes, architecture report
