b'2015-08-20T18:50:59 <kasparnet> I\'m getting a "socket hang up" error in my \'getPreferences\' function
2015-08-20T18:51:20 <kasparnet> which results in a fluid.fail, and makes the system explode with a fatal error
2015-08-20T18:51:38 <colinclark> kasparnet\'s going driftin\'
2015-08-20T18:53:36 <Bosmon> kasparnet - why aren\'t we seeing this issue in current trunk?
2015-08-20T18:55:03 <Bosmon> kasparnet and ALSO - why does the system explode with a fatal error if you overrode the failure handler with this: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/tests/DeviceReporterErrorTests.js#L72#

2015-08-20T18:56:48 <kasparnet> for the first question: I\'ve only just added the functionality of the preference server getting to react to an error in the system.. before it was just silently accepting that it couldn\'t get the preferences, I believe
2015-08-20T18:57:32 <kasparnet> in terms of why it still explodes, I\'m not sure
2015-08-20T18:58:00 <kasparnet> would I need to push another soft failure handler in case there might be a second explosion?
2015-08-20T18:58:17 <kasparnet> (ie. one explosion from the device reporter and one from the settings handler)

2015-08-20T18:58:50 <kasparnet> btw, Bosmon, colinclark, saw this and thought of you (being my only real references to the Dr. Who universe) http://www.qwantz.com/index.php?comic=2570
2015-08-20T19:00:33 * alanharnum has quit
2015-08-20T19:00:41 * alanharnum joined the channel
2015-08-20T19:02:31 <Bosmon> kasparnet - well, for a start, failing to get preferences should trigger request onError, not fluid.fail - fluid.fail is reserved for cases which correspond to "assertion failure" - that is, there is a provable logic error in the implementation of the system
2015-08-20T19:02:58 <Bosmon> kasparnet - DO YOU NOT RECALL my previous warnings about the fact that THE STATE OF THE NODE VM AFTER AN UNCAUGHT EXCEPTION CANNOT BE DEPENDED UPON : p
2015-08-20T19:04:09 * alanharnum joined the channel
2015-08-20T19:08:06 <kasparnet> Bosmon: haha yeah, ok - those are good points
2015-08-20T19:08:30 <kasparnet> but it\'s true, I should fail the request instead of making the framework explode
2015-08-20T19:10:00 * cindyli joined the channel
2015-08-20T19:11:57 <colinclark> kasparnet: whoa look at those caps from Bosmon!
2015-08-20T19:12:54 <colinclark> apparently making the universe explode is verboten
2015-08-20T19:14:59 <Bosmon> kasparnet - and the good thing about firing onError is that the magically implemented FLUID-5333 ABORTABLE EVENTS behaviour will ensure that you do not blow up the universe a 2nd time

2015-08-20T19:15:58 <Bosmon> I\'ve been on a very far-ranging tour of JURAs this evening
2015-08-20T19:16:12 <Bosmon> So I have all this information AT MY FINGERTIPS.....

2015-08-20T19:43:08 <kasparnet> ok - so not actually doing a fluid fail prevented explosions.. not sure why I decided to do that in the first place

2015-08-20T20:38:56 <colinclark> Have you updated the documentation to conform to the new grade ordering?
2015-08-20T20:39:50 <colinclark> with some kind of special note that describes the "strength" of fluid.viewComponent due to the nature of its unusual signature?

2015-08-20T20:57:57 <Bosmon> colinclark - I updated the docs in general
2015-08-20T20:58:08 <Bosmon> I wonder whether the note about viewComponent may confuse more than it enlightens
2015-08-20T20:58:13 <colinclark> Well...
2015-08-20T20:58:28 <colinclark> I certainly would have never known that my viewComponent and rendererComponent grades MUST come last
2015-08-20T20:58:48 <colinclark> I don\'t know how I could possibly know this, as a user, unless there\'s some kind of note about it somewhere?
2015-08-20T20:59:12 <colinclark> don\'t you think?
2015-08-20T20:59:48 <Bosmon> I guess I could put it in the docs on viewComponent in general
2015-08-20T20:59:56 <Bosmon> Where do you think it might go, and what could it say?
2015-08-20T21:00:44 <colinclark> I think it should probably say something to the effect of
2015-08-20T21:01:33 <colinclark> "Note: in the current version of Infusion, you must declare all grades derived from fluid.viewComponent after those that are not"
2015-08-20T21:01:40 <colinclark> That\'s not quite clear enough
2015-08-20T21:01:43 <colinclark> but something along those lines

2015-08-20T21:17:26 <Bosmon> Thanks for the headsup, gtirloni
2015-08-20T21:17:43 <Bosmon> I might be tinkering with it, but just let me know when it\'s the all-clear - cheers!
2015-08-20T21:19:25 <gtirloni> okay!

2015-08-20T23:10:46 <gtirloni> if anyone is still around, jira has been upgraded from 5.2 to 6.4 ... it\'s still running on the old server though
2015-08-20T23:11:16 <gtirloni> i\'m gonna have dinner and be back in 30min or so, to start migrating it to the new server, which will mean more downtime unfortunately.. but hopefully it\'ll be quickier
2015-08-20T23:18:53 <Bosmon> Hey, thanks gtirloni
2015-08-20T23:19:32 <Bosmon> Wow, this new JIRA is plenty wierd-looking
2015-08-20T23:19:50 <Bosmon> Lots of nasty Metro-style flat areas : P
2015-08-20T23:21:42 <Bosmon> It feels unpleasantly slow compared to the old version.... lots of sluggish AJAX-generated content
2015-08-20T23:34:34 <gtirloni> yea, it feels kind of awkward
2015-08-20T23:35:03 <gtirloni> the old server is giving really bad performance though.. it took me a while to get the backups in place
2015-08-20T23:36:07 <gtirloni> i\'m planning to take it down in about 10min... will that disrupt your work too much?
2015-08-20T23:45:55 <gtirloni> ok here we go...

2015-08-20T23:47:40 <Bosmon> Oh well, better go to bed :)

2015-08-20T18:17:05 <kasparnet> so I\'m just looking at my failing preference work
2015-08-20T18:17:25 <kasparnet> and I\'m finding a {request} with no "onError" event
2015-08-20T18:18:01 <kasparnet> is that because I\'ve doing too much crack cocaine, or is this something that actually exists for some reason?
2015-08-20T18:21:16 <kasparnet> Bosmon: ^
2015-08-20T18:22:07 <Bosmon> There is no reason this could or should exist
2015-08-20T18:22:35 * clown likely not the cocaine, but the beer

2015-08-20T18:23:10 <Bosmon> How do you know that the onError event isn\'t there?
2015-08-20T18:23:51 <kasparnet> I\'m inspecting the {request} reference I\'m passing to my function

2015-08-20T18:25:20 <Bosmon> Also that is not a request object
2015-08-20T18:25:35 <Bosmon> That is, it is the request from the point of view of the client
2015-08-20T18:25:42 <Bosmon> You have mixed that up with the request from the point of view of the server
2015-08-20T18:25:54 <Bosmon> How happy I am that I put event names in
2015-08-20T18:26:17 <Bosmon> kettle.test.request.http is the request that you make from a test fixture to the server
2015-08-20T18:26:32 <Bosmon> This has no onError event
2015-08-20T18:27:18 <Bosmon> You\'ve mixed this up with "kettle.requests.request.http"
2015-08-20T18:27:21 <Bosmon> Which is the server\'s request
2015-08-20T18:27:26 <Bosmon> This has an onError event

2015-08-20T18:27:51 <Bosmon> That one
2015-08-20T18:29:50 <kasparnet> ah ok
2015-08-20T18:30:00 <kasparnet> so there is some amount of sanity left in the world
2015-08-20T18:46:20 <kasparnet> Bosmon: ok - so back to my original hassle with the preferences server testing
2015-08-20T18:46:52 <kasparnet> it seems I\'ve hit some racing conditions in my testing
2015-08-20T18:47:27 <Bosmon> Perhaps you should instead apply some DRIFTING CONDITIONS : P
2015-08-20T18:49:03 <kasparnet> hah indeed
2015-08-20T18:49:13 <kasparnet> I\'m sure sgithens would appreciate that
2015-08-20T18:50:13 <kasparnet> the issue happens when the newly added device reporter test is run .. as the architecture calls the prefs server and device reporter simoultanously
2015-08-20T18:50:25 <kasparnet> if the device reporter manages to fail first (as it should in that test)
