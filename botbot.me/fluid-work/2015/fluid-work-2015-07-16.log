2015-07-16T14:36:43 <alanharnum> comments welcomed
2015-07-16T14:36:53 * cindyli joined the channel
2015-07-16T14:40:52 <colinclark> The Mike Bostock article is quite interesting in the context of our chart authoring tool
2015-07-16T14:41:14 <colinclark> since it describes some very rudimentary and ad-hoc "conventions" for writing charting code in a configurable way
2015-07-16T14:41:30 <colinclark> Whatever library we choose, we\'ll wrap it as an Infusion component
2015-07-16T14:41:52 <colinclark> where we\'ll have much more advanced and regular means to configure and adapt the results, either up front or on the fly

2015-07-16T14:55:25 <colinclark> alanharnum, Justin_o, cindyli: I\'m curious about your thoughts on this issue of "SVG vs. Canvas"
2015-07-16T14:55:47 <colinclark> I see the bullet point there, but it isn\'t clear to me if you think there\'s a benefit to one or the other (or support for both)
2015-07-16T14:56:45 <alanharnum> colinclark: we need to explore it a bit more, but the main stream of thought seems to be that SVG is better for charting than Canvas due to separation of concerns
2015-07-16T14:57:00 <alanharnum> and being able to style SVG with CSS more easily
2015-07-16T14:57:56 <alanharnum> OTOH people seem to advocate canvas for performance if you\'re dealing with massive datasets
2015-07-16T14:58:09 <colinclark> alanharnum: Can you be a bit more specific in regards to "separation of concerns?"
2015-07-16T14:58:19 <colinclark> Yeah, SVG rendering is still quite slow in most browsers
2015-07-16T14:58:54 <colinclark> it\'s been several years since I\'ve done any real work with it, but there were interesting accessibility challenges there, too
2015-07-16T14:59:10 <colinclark> where Canvas accessibility techniques may be more mature
2015-07-16T14:59:31 <colinclark> I\'m thinking it\'s safe to assume that any library we find out there won\'t have any meaningful support for assistive technologies or keyboard navigation
2015-07-16T14:59:55 <colinclark> so either way we\'re looking at adding ARIA to the SVG or an accessibility DOM to the Canvas
2015-07-16T15:00:36 <colinclark> which motivates for a sufficiently "visible" model or scene graph of what\'s been rendered by the charting library
2015-07-16T15:00:38 <colinclark> if you see what I mean
2015-07-16T15:00:46 <alanharnum> as I understand the thinking based on limited research: Canvas has better performance, SVG is better for separating behaviour (styling with CSS vs. passing colors via Javascript)
2015-07-16T15:01:23 <alanharnum> this is a recent Stack answer that seems coherent: http://stackoverflow.com/a/28158188
2015-07-16T15:02:02 <alanharnum> SVG seems to better at letting you have separate styles and suporting interactivity
2015-07-16T15:02:28 <alanharnum> i don\'t know enough to give a definitive answer; I think I lean towards SVG-based approaches for the specific use case here
2015-07-16T15:02:36 <alanharnum> long-term, we may need the flexibility of both
2015-07-16T15:03:48 <colinclark> yeah, it\'s clear to me we\'re not making a choice about a pie charting library
2015-07-16T15:03:52 <colinclark> if you see what I mean :)
2015-07-16T15:03:58 <alanharnum> yup
2015-07-16T15:04:09 <alanharnum> i think d3-based libraries are a safe bet
2015-07-16T15:04:11 <colinclark> it\'s interesting, this SO responce
2015-07-16T15:04:23 <colinclark> the point about retained mode is essential
2015-07-16T15:04:28 <alanharnum> yeah i think so to
2015-07-16T15:04:31 <colinclark> So you probably know all this...
2015-07-16T15:04:36 <colinclark> but Canvas is a non-retained mode API
2015-07-16T15:04:56 <colinclark> so if you imagine drawing a circle on a canvas, you just stick some colour on some pixels in the right spots
2015-07-16T15:04:59 <colinclark> and that\'s it
2015-07-16T15:05:06 <colinclark> Canvas has no notion that there\'s a circle there
2015-07-16T15:05:17 <alanharnum> my sense is that Canvas will be harder to manage some things that are critical for us, like accessibility hooks and such
2015-07-16T15:05:20 * jhung_away is now known as jhung
2015-07-16T15:05:21 <colinclark> that it has particular boundaries that someone might want to, for example, click on or Tab to with the keyboard
2015-07-16T15:05:33 <colinclark> Well, alanharnum, I guess that was my point from earlier
2015-07-16T15:05:39 <colinclark> SVG *seems* like it should be more accessible
2015-07-16T15:05:49 <colinclark> but interestingly, Canvas accessibility techniques are little more established
2015-07-16T15:06:04 <colinclark> in terms of this whole retained mode issue...
2015-07-16T15:06:09 <alanharnum> this is interesting: https://bocoup.com/weblog/d3js-and-canvas/
2015-07-16T15:06:21 <colinclark> so you can imagine drawing a circle in CVG, on the other hand, and there will be an actual DOM element that represents that circle
2015-07-16T15:06:28 <colinclark> so we have an object model baked right in
2015-07-16T15:06:29 <alanharnum> talks about working with Canvas using D3 to retain your data structures
2015-07-16T15:06:46 <colinclark> in theory we can then set up CSS rules for circle elements, paths, etc.
2015-07-16T15:06:55 <colinclark> but what\'s interesting is reality
2015-07-16T15:07:11 <colinclark> the extent to which SVG charting libraries end up rendering a vast set of points
2015-07-16T15:07:21 <colinclark> which may in aggregate represent an object...
2015-07-16T15:07:36 <colinclark> a think you\'d want to click on or tab to or expose to an assistive technology in some way
2015-07-16T15:08:00 <colinclark> and so then you may well find yourself in a position not unlike with a Canvas
2015-07-16T15:08:16 <colinclark> having to provide some means by which to group and describe low-level "bits" as things
2015-07-16T15:08:38 <alanharnum> yeah I think that\'s where D3 may come in
2015-07-16T15:08:58 <colinclark> yes
2015-07-16T15:08:59 <alanharnum> D3 has very strong modeling of data
2015-07-16T15:09:07 <colinclark> I suspect we\'ll end up using something D3 based, as you said
2015-07-16T15:09:15 <colinclark> I also suspect that D3 isn\'t really what we want
2015-07-16T15:09:20 <colinclark> if you see what I mean :)
2015-07-16T15:09:27 <alanharnum> sort of :)
2015-07-16T15:10:28 <colinclark> well, this article you just sent sort of hints at it
2015-07-16T15:10:39 <colinclark> D3 is filled with features related to data binding, etc.
2015-07-16T15:11:08 <colinclark> suddenly when rendering outside of what the author calls its "lifecycle metaphor"
2015-07-16T15:11:37 <colinclark> so the question starts to emerge
2015-07-16T15:11:49 <colinclark> what does D3 offer us in a situation where we\'re not using it\'s default modes
2015-07-16T15:12:11 <colinclark> and one gets the sense that you can leverage some of these features
2015-07-16T15:12:20 <colinclark> but you start swimming upstream in interesting ways
2015-07-16T15:13:14 <alanharnum> yeah D3\'s complexity makes me a bit wary
2015-07-16T15:13:17 <colinclark> I have an impression, very much in the abstract, that the ideal charting library would provide a blend of WebGL-based Canvas and strategic use of the DOM
2015-07-16T15:13:35 <alanharnum> "everyone" uses it, but that doesn\'t necessarily mean it\'s the right choice
2015-07-16T15:13:40 <colinclark> yeah
2015-07-16T15:13:48 <colinclark> though we will probably follow "everyone" for a while
2015-07-16T15:13:53 <colinclark> just to get some work done :)
2015-07-16T15:13:58 <colinclark> interestingly, I believe this is quite close to the model that PhET\'s Scenery library uses
2015-07-16T15:14:07 <alanharnum> i did think http://gionkunz.github.io/chartist-js/ was an interesting counterpoint
2015-07-16T15:14:23 <colinclark> http://phetsims.github.io/scenery/
2015-07-16T15:14:25 <colinclark> alanharnum: I did too
2015-07-16T15:14:26 <alanharnum> clearly done by someone who takes issue with D3 and D3-based libraries dominance in the open source charting space
2015-07-16T15:14:33 <colinclark> I\'ve been reading its source code
2015-07-16T15:14:35 <colinclark> and will continue to
2015-07-16T15:14:46 <colinclark> I was thinking about these kinds of lists
2015-07-16T15:14:51 <colinclark> "requirements lists"
2015-07-16T15:14:55 * Bosmon7 joined the channel
2015-07-16T15:15:04 <colinclark> You can squint at one and it inevitably looks like any other
2015-07-16T15:15:14 <colinclark> a list of responsible-sounding things phrased in the abstract
2015-07-16T15:15:23 <colinclark> "has to be fast, has to be small, has to have features"
2015-07-16T15:15:47 <colinclark> in practice, reading the source code ends up clarifying these kinds of lists much more than anything else in my experience
2015-07-16T15:15:52 <colinclark> tedious though it can be
2015-07-16T15:16:21 <colinclark> anyway, it\'ll be interesting to see what you guys figure out
2015-07-16T15:16:51 <alanharnum> "we need to code our own from scratch" ;)
2015-07-16T15:17:24 <colinclark> lol
2015-07-16T15:17:26 <colinclark> yes
