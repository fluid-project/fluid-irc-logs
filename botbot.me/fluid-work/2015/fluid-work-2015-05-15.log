b'2015-05-15T17:59:47 <simonjb> michelled: should we add these to the technical debt section?
2015-05-15T18:00:43 <jessm> everyone: this might be of interest http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-moves-intervene-disability-discrimination-lawsuit-alleging-miami
2015-05-15T18:01:17 <michelled> simonjb: yes, let\'s add them
2015-05-15T18:01:36 <Bosmon> Justin_o - ah, we want to read the name of each language in the language itself.... well, conceivably we could punt that for the demo if we find we are short of time
2015-05-15T18:01:38 <simonjb> ok, I will add them michelled
2015-05-15T18:01:43 <michelled> thx
2015-05-15T18:02:15 <Bosmon> Justin_o, cindyli - I\'m noticing a worrying issue which I think is caused by our tooltips - it is virtually impossible to operate the "turn voice OFF" button at the head of the app by clicking on it
2015-05-15T18:02:30 <Bosmon> If I do it by clicking on the icon at the left itself, it works every time
2015-05-15T18:02:38 <Bosmon> However if I try to click on the text, it fails almost every time
2015-05-15T18:02:56 <Justin_o> Bosmon: that\'s sort of an issue with the infusion tooltip
2015-05-15T18:03:05 <Bosmon> It appears that the click is intercepted by the tooltip, even if I am not clicking on it directly
2015-05-15T18:03:11 <Justin_o> basically it gets recreated as you move over all the sub elements
2015-05-15T18:03:13 * cindyli has quit
2015-05-15T18:03:44 <Justin_o> you are probably actually slightly moving your mouse off of the text and over the whitespace and a new tooltip is created, which causes it to be read
2015-05-15T18:03:53 <Justin_o> or something like that
2015-05-15T18:04:08 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I don\'t think so
2015-05-15T18:04:15 * cindyli joined the channel
2015-05-15T18:04:18 <Bosmon> I\'m taking special care to keep the mouse pointer stock still : P
2015-05-15T18:04:31 <Bosmon> But I\'ll debug into the tooltip component to see if I can find what is happening
2015-05-15T18:04:58 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks. maybe you are clicking on the tooltip itself?
2015-05-15T18:05:13 <Bosmon> Justin_o - no, I\'m clicking well away from the tooltip
2015-05-15T18:05:20 <Bosmon> Which is displayed below the button
2015-05-15T18:05:44 <Bosmon> However, when I do click, the tooltip moves itself to appear under the mouse pointer
2015-05-15T18:05:54 <Justin_o> Bosmon: hmm.. not sure then.. i only get that issue in the cases i mentioned
2015-05-15T18:06:08 <Justin_o> Bosmon: ah.. so it\'s probably still related to recreation of the tooltip
2015-05-15T18:06:14 <Bosmon> yes
2015-05-15T18:06:16 <Bosmon> In some way
2015-05-15T18:11:15 <anastasiac> michelled, could you elaborate on the name \xe2\x80\x9ctechnical debt\xe2\x80\x9d ?
2015-05-15T18:21:34 <michelled> anastasiac: it\'s really an experiment. what I\'m hoping to accomplish is to capture the shortcuts we take as we prioritize shipping features sooner over code quality. then I hope to schedule these tasks into our regular work so that we slow start to pay off this debt
2015-05-15T18:22:29 <michelled> we might find that we\'d be better off organizing this through JIRA instead of the iteration plan page
2015-05-15T18:22:41 <michelled> but let\'s give it a couple week before we switch strategies

2015-05-15T18:39:39 <cindyli> anastasiac: in terms of FLOE-336, Justin_o and I found we can style the page based on the language code set on the page - http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_lang.asp
2015-05-15T18:40:56 <cindyli> so, we are thinking, instead of setting a class like "gpii-fd-lang-style-en" to the body element, we can set the lang attribute to the html element such as <html lang="fr">, and the styling can base on that. what do you think?
2015-05-15T18:41:17 <anastasiac> cindyli, that\xe2\x80\x99s fine, as long as there\xe2\x80\x99s something for the CSS to scope the styles to
2015-05-15T18:41:23 <cindyli> coo

2015-05-15T18:41:54 <cindyli> that would be great. thanks, anastasiac

2015-05-15T14:49:09 <Bosmon> Hi there Justin_o
2015-05-15T14:50:02 <Justin_o> Bosmon: hello, cindyli and I managed to find it... it was getting confused because the PMT is using a really old version of infusion
2015-05-15T14:50:15 <Bosmon> Well done :)
2015-05-15T14:50:20 <Bosmon> What are you up to with the PMT?
2015-05-15T14:51:28 <Justin_o> Bosmon: trying to answer a question on a pull request https://github.com/GPII/prefsEditors/pull/105#issuecomment-99900414
2015-05-15T14:51:35 <Justin_o> we\'re fairly stumped though
2015-05-15T15:05:23 <gtirloni> hi, does anyone know what\'s the story behind the wordpress-fss-theme? is it still used/developed?
2015-05-15T15:06:03 <Justin_o> gtirloni: i doubt it, we dropped fss from infusion. It was our old css framework
2015-05-15T15:07:08 <gtirloni> thanks
2015-05-15T15:09:00 <gtirloni> let me explain, i\'m asking because i see the "idi-theme" in inclusivedesign.ca including files from wordpress-fss-theme (which is a theme that is installed but disabled)
2015-05-15T15:09:16 <gtirloni> @import url("../wordpress-fss-theme/style.css");
2015-05-15T15:09:40 <Justin_o> anastasiac: ^ do you have any thoughts?
2015-05-15T15:11:10 <anastasiac> gtirloni, Justin_o: The wordpress-fss-theme was designed as a base, almost blank theme that add FSS and UIO to a wordpress site. Our idi-theme is built as a child theme of that
2015-05-15T15:11:23 <anastasiac> we will hopefully retire that theme altogether soon-ish
2015-05-15T15:11:34 <anastasiac> now that we have a wordpress plugin for uio
2015-05-15T15:11:48 <anastasiac> and hopefully will soon have a plugin for the video
2015-05-15T15:11:58 <gtirloni> cool, thanks. i was just running some security checks and notice i can\'t hide the fact we\'re using wordpress because the theme itself has "wordpress-" in it so.. then i got curious
2015-05-15T15:12:08 <Bosmon> anastasiac - a plugin for the video?
2015-05-15T15:12:10 <gtirloni> but it\'s nothing critical
2015-05-15T15:12:16 <anastasiac> sorry - videoPlayer

2015-05-15T17:27:48 <Bosmon> Hi there cindyli - how is the model reorganisation work looking?
2015-05-15T17:28:24 <Bosmon> Also - do you and Justin_o have an opinion about simonjb \'s comment: https://github.com/fluid-project/first-discovery/pull/47/files#r30414103
2015-05-15T17:28:30 <cindyli> Bosmon: it\'s looking pretty look. just need to fix the builder tests
2015-05-15T17:28:39 <Bosmon> cindyli - awesome
2015-05-15T17:29:01 <Bosmon> I\'m glad it hasn\'t thrown up any awkward issues... this reorganisation is really important for the usability of the tool
2015-05-15T17:29:05 <simonjb> thanks Bosmon -- I was going to ask you about that!
2015-05-15T17:29:21 <cindyli> for now, switched to work on FLOE-336, will continue once i\'m done with 336
2015-05-15T17:29:33 * sepideh has quit
2015-05-15T17:29:58 <Bosmon> I can take up the "refocusing" work if needed
2015-05-15T17:30:00 <Justin_o> Bosmon: I\'m not sure i have much of an opinion. Perhaps a new constant that could be used in place of False might help... so that it could be more explicit on what it is doing.
2015-05-15T17:30:02 * sepideh joined the channel
2015-05-15T17:30:03 <Justin_o> simonjb: ^
2015-05-15T17:30:15 <Bosmon> Although I guess once we have FLUID-333 solved the tool will appear to work much better
2015-05-15T17:30:22 <Bosmon> Justin_o - well the issue is that this is a jQuery API, not one of ours
2015-05-15T17:30:51 <Bosmon> Are you proposing that we put a global constant in the fluid.* space holding "false" which we return from event handlers in this case?
2015-05-15T17:31:32 <Bosmon> It really isn\'t an urgent issue and we absolutely shouldn\'t hold up the pull request for it, but it would be nice to "know what we think"
2015-05-15T17:34:42 <Justin_o> Bosmon: reading through the comments on the stack overflow you linked to http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1357118/event-preventdefault-vs-return-false
2015-05-15T17:34:51 <cindyli> and this one - http://fuelyourcoding.com/jquery-events-stop-misusing-return-false/
2015-05-15T17:35:06 <Justin_o> i think maybe we should just keep them separated to avoid confusion about what type of even this is and what it will do
2015-05-15T17:35:37 * sepideh has quit
2015-05-15T17:35:46 <Bosmon> Justin_o - ok, I\'m fine with that

2015-05-15T17:38:15 <simonjb> I will file a jira issue for Bosmon\'s suggestion to make a new fluid.changeElementValue() function
2015-05-15T17:38:38 <simonjb> thanks all for chatting through the event issue
2015-05-15T17:40:42 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I\'m fine with FLOE-312 yes, as long as someone can vouch for its function wrt the designs

2015-05-15T17:46:45 <simonjb> Justin_o, Bosmon: I have filed http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5666
2015-05-15T17:48:21 <simonjb> michelled ^
2015-05-15T17:48:42 <simonjb> michelled: shall I add to the floe iteration plan wiki page?
2015-05-15T17:49:03 <Justin_o> simonjb: can you add a link to that in the pull request too
2015-05-15T17:49:11 <Bosmon> Thanks, Justin_o
2015-05-15T17:49:14 <simonjb> Justin_o: done
2015-05-15T17:49:28 <Bosmon> I\'ve just been looking at http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLOE-335 - I guess you\'ll handle this in Infusion by improving the TTS component?
2015-05-15T17:51:00 <Justin_o> Bosmon: the TTS can already taken in an option for the lang both globally and for specific calls to speak
2015-05-15T17:52:29 <Bosmon> It looks like the relevant APIs involve i) getting a list of voices using speechSynthesis.getVoices(); ii) setting the "voiceURI" element of the SpeechSynthesisUtterance structure
2015-05-15T17:54:09 <Bosmon> Justin_o - ok cool
2015-05-15T17:54:28 * sepideh joined the channel
2015-05-15T17:54:52 <Bosmon> It looks like the only wrinkle might be converting an "_" as it appears in one of our Locales to a "-" as expected by the Speech API
2015-05-15T17:55:05 <Bosmon> But I don\'t think we actually have any qualified Locales supported for the demo anyway
2015-05-15T17:55:22 <Justin_o> Bosmon: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/components/textToSpeech/js/TextToSpeech.js#L48
2015-05-15T17:55:35 <Bosmon> Presumably the API is smart enough to select a voice with the correct language without requiring you to explicitly set a voiceURI with that language
2015-05-15T17:55:44 <Justin_o> Bosmon: and https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/components/textToSpeech/js/TextToSpeech.js#L156
2015-05-15T17:55:56 <Justin_o> Bosmon:  i hope it\'s smart enough, if not we\'d have to do what you suggested above
2015-05-15T17:56:02 <Bosmon> Cool
2015-05-15T17:56:11 <Bosmon> Looks like this won\'t be a big amount of work then
2015-05-15T17:56:13 <Bosmon> That\'s a releif
2015-05-15T17:56:15 <Bosmon> relief :)
2015-05-15T17:56:26 <Justin_o> but there was a bug when i started all this with chrome where it wouldn\'t actually have the list of languages till some random number of ms after load
2015-05-15T17:56:57 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I\'m still seeing this bug, yes
2015-05-15T17:57:00 <michelled> simonjb: I added 5666 to the iteration page in a new \'technical debt\' table. it\'s about 1/3 down the page. let\'s start tracking all these little JIRAs that we end up creating and then adding them to iterations as we go
2015-05-15T17:57:05 <Justin_o> Bosmon: um the language for the tooltips might be harder for the language panel, since they we\'ll need to inform the tts what language to use for them
2015-05-15T17:57:14 <Bosmon> The first time I ask for the lanagueg list it is always empty
2015-05-15T17:57:23 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yep, that was the bug :(
2015-05-15T17:57:30 <Bosmon> Sorry, the voice list
2015-05-15T17:57:37 <Justin_o> yes, that\'s right
2015-05-15T17:57:39 <simonjb> great, thanks michelled
2015-05-15T17:58:03 <Bosmon> But if it\'s ok to just set "lang" on the TTS component at startup, it hopefully won\'t matter
2015-05-15T17:58:52 <Justin_o> Bosmon: hopefully not, cindyli and i are also going to experiment with setting the lang attributes in the  DOM
