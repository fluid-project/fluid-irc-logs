b'2015-08-11T20:53:21 <colinclark> if, however, we believe that there\'s more to the popular discourse of stability
2015-08-11T20:53:43 <Bosmon> "PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes."
2015-08-11T20:53:44 <colinclark> then we should avoid highly frequent major version releases
2015-08-11T20:53:59 <Bosmon> I mean, clearly, the concept of a "backwards-compatible bug fix" is simply self-contradictory
2015-08-11T20:54:02 * kasparnet has quit
2015-08-11T20:54:05 <colinclark> indeed
2015-08-11T20:54:17 <Bosmon> Either it fixed a bug, or it is backwards-compatible
2015-08-11T20:54:20 <Bosmon> It can\'t be both :)
2015-08-11T20:54:33 <colinclark> "spiritually backwards compatible"
2015-08-11T20:54:38 <Bosmon> Yes
2015-08-11T20:54:50 <Bosmon> It\'s part of that bizarrely legalistic view
2015-08-11T20:55:04 <Bosmon> That imagines that the "intended behaviour" of a system could ever be completely documented
2015-08-11T20:55:09 <colinclark> anyway, I\'m willing to give up on the notion of releasing Infusion 43 in six months
2015-08-11T20:55:11 <Bosmon> Let alone how it IS documented in practice
2015-08-11T20:55:17 <colinclark> if others think the -beta suffix is more appropriate
2015-08-11T20:55:28 <Bosmon> Which even for the libraries with the highest currency such as express, is "miserably badly"
2015-08-11T20:55:31 <Bosmon> Ok
2015-08-11T20:55:39 <colinclark> I have this funny feeling that very frequent version number incrementation will actually better convey what you want, Bosmon
2015-08-11T20:55:55 <colinclark> in that people will see "oh, they keep releasing major versions constantly"
2015-08-11T20:56:01 * the-t-in-rtf has quit
2015-08-11T20:56:05 <colinclark> and some day we will slow down and release minor versions instead :)
2015-08-11T20:56:06 <Bosmon> colinclark - if there were a FOURTH level of versioning, I would be perfectly happy :)
2015-08-11T20:56:19 <Bosmon> But I still want a number that represents, "EVERYTHING BREAKS"
2015-08-11T20:56:32 <Bosmon> Like it does today
2015-08-11T20:56:33 <colinclark> lol
2015-08-11T20:56:43 <colinclark> Justin_o: You want to make the decision?
2015-08-11T20:58:16 <Justin_o> I\'m closer aligned with Bosmon, although the major version will probably get bumped from time to time without a global breakage. At least that\'s how I\'d imagine things will turn out.
2015-08-11T21:00:31 <Bosmon> Yes
2015-08-11T21:00:48 <Bosmon> Once we get past the OPTIONS FLATTENING REVOLUTION, I think we will then be able to use the major version the way that semver intends
2015-08-11T21:00:53 <colinclark> So are these alphas? Or betas? Or just -pre\'s?
2015-08-11T21:01:19 <Bosmon> To me, "beta" more or less reflects the fact that we\'ve done some reasonable testing on this release
2015-08-11T21:01:47 <colinclark> and one last question...
2015-08-11T21:02:00 <Bosmon> It was only this weekend that I worked out that the async ginger world will INDEED allow us to turn "createOnEvent" into a standard component option
2015-08-11T21:02:10 <Bosmon> Even though this is, seemingly, a totally self-contradictory idea
2015-08-11T21:02:14 <colinclark> ah, interesting
2015-08-11T21:02:28 <Bosmon> How could you have a directive that determines when a thing is to be created, that is part of the thing itself? : P
2015-08-11T21:02:32 <Bosmon> BUT
2015-08-11T21:02:46 <Bosmon> This miracle, and many others, will be the expected fruits of the ginger world
2015-08-11T21:02:58 <colinclark> What do we do about npm modules? For 1.9.x and 2.0.0-x?
2015-08-11T21:03:18 <Bosmon> colinclark - I guess for 2.0.0-x we should simply publish them in the expected way
2015-08-11T21:03:47 <Bosmon> I guess I should merge in that .npmignore pull into my branch
2015-08-11T21:03:52 <Bosmon> I said I would do that
2015-08-11T21:05:20 <colinclark> That will at least cover Node users nicely
2015-08-11T21:05:50 <colinclark> and we\'ll have to defer the question of how exactly we distribute a web module some day
2015-08-11T21:06:50 <colinclark> Do you think it\'s unreasonable to assume that every npm user also has Grunt installed?
2015-08-11T21:15:13 <Bosmon> colinclark - I think it is, yes
2015-08-11T21:15:18 <Bosmon> sorry
2015-08-11T21:15:23 <Bosmon> No, I think it isn\'t unreasonable
2015-08-11T21:15:37 * jessm has quit
2015-08-11T21:15:49 <Bosmon> Ok, I\'ve updated my branch with Justin_o \'s .npmignore update
2015-08-11T21:17:17 <colinclark> thank you
2015-08-11T21:18:06 <Justin_o> colinclark: i don\'t know, do they use gulp with npm too
2015-08-11T21:18:53 <colinclark> Presumably there are people who are gulp or broccoli or whatever-it-is users
2015-08-11T21:19:07 <colinclark> perhaps also quite vehemently so
2015-08-11T21:19:51 <Justin_o> broccoli sounds interesting, what is that
2015-08-11T21:20:26 <colinclark> https://github.com/broccolijs
2015-08-11T21:20:57 <colinclark> Apparently it\'s "Comparable to the Rails asset pipeline in scope"
2015-08-11T21:20:59 <colinclark> which tells me tons
2015-08-11T21:21:15 <colinclark> it\'s like when Express used to describe itself as "like Sinatra, but for Node.js"
2015-08-11T21:21:57 <Justin_o> interesting that one of their builds is failing
2015-08-11T21:22:15 <colinclark> on node 10
2015-08-11T21:24:51 <colinclark> Anyway, I guess the question of how to distribute web-based versions of Infusion is still somewhat complex
2015-08-11T21:25:15 <colinclark> I\'d totally dig a framework-only module, were it ever to exist
2015-08-11T21:33:21 <colinclark> nice to see our logging system finally ditch all the old Yahoo, Opera, and IE stuff, Bosmon
2015-08-11T21:33:28 <Bosmon> colinclark - cheers, yes
2015-08-11T21:33:39 <Bosmon> As well as the IE8 and IE9 console branch : P
2015-08-11T21:33:43 <colinclark> yeah

2015-08-11T20:13:39 <colinclark> Justin_o, Bosmon2: I have made the 1.9.x branch: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/tree/1.9.x
2015-08-11T20:13:51 <colinclark> Now I\'ll review the last of Bosmon2
2015-08-11T20:13:54 <colinclark> \'s changes
2015-08-11T20:14:00 <colinclark> and merge the monster into master

2015-08-11T20:14:56 <Justin_o> colinclark: thanks :)
2015-08-11T20:15:03 <colinclark> I think at some point we should talk about cutting "light releases"
2015-08-11T20:15:19 <colinclark> given the amount of testing that has gone into this pull request, we might well want to call it 2.0.0
2015-08-11T20:15:22 <Justin_o> "light release"?
2015-08-11T20:15:44 <colinclark> Releases that come out frequently, and that require a less onerous investment in time to test and prepare
2015-08-11T20:16:45 <colinclark> Is there a reason why we shouldn\'t just cut this as 2.0.0?
2015-08-11T20:17:07 <colinclark> and keep ticking our major revision number forward when some interesting new changes occur and we can spare time for a testing sprint?
2015-08-11T20:17:27 <Justin_o> colinclark: we\'ve sort of been doing that with every merge, because we\'ve been taking anything master for the things that use infusion
2015-08-11T20:17:36 <colinclark> yes
2015-08-11T20:17:52 <colinclark> As a heavy "third-party" user of Infusion, I\'d like to see more frequent releases
2015-08-11T20:17:57 <colinclark> with packages :P
2015-08-11T20:18:11 <colinclark> i.e. publishing on npm
2015-08-11T20:20:12 <Justin_o> and bower would be nice too, or something similar for the client
2015-08-11T20:20:32 <colinclark> I guess bower probably isn\'t workable for Infusion
2015-08-11T20:20:43 <colinclark> since, as far as I know, it doesn\'t support scripts like npm
2015-08-11T20:21:02 <Bosmon> An actual 2.0.0?
2015-08-11T20:21:08 <Bosmon> Rather than 2.0.0-beta.1 ?
2015-08-11T20:21:11 <colinclark> Bosmon: IN ITS ACTUALITY
2015-08-11T20:21:21 <colinclark> It has been tested
2015-08-11T20:21:25 <colinclark> let\'s SHIP IT
2015-08-11T20:21:41 <Bosmon> I guess... but hadn\'t we determined that 2.0.0 would be the release that actually worked? : P
2015-08-11T20:21:46 <colinclark> bring on Infusion 44.0.2403
2015-08-11T20:21:46 <Bosmon> That is, the one that had the "new renderer" in it
2015-08-11T20:22:01 <colinclark> Bosmon: We might have
2015-08-11T20:22:08 <colinclark> I guess I\'m suddenly arguing that it shouldn\'t be
2015-08-11T20:22:22 <colinclark> Here\'s what I can say, wearing my "user of Infusion" hat
2015-08-11T20:22:38 <colinclark> I\'d like 1. To know what version of Infusion I\'m actually running
2015-08-11T20:22:42 <Bosmon> I\'m a little nervous about going with something a bit too "sem-ver-y".... in that we are pretty unclear, in total, as to what amounts to a "breaking change to the Infusion API"
2015-08-11T20:22:47 <colinclark> 2. Have some reasonable guarantees of stability
2015-08-11T20:22:55 <Bosmon> And personally I would prefer not to have to think about that issue immediately
2015-08-11T20:23:03 <colinclark> 3. Be able to reference a particular version from a package manager
2015-08-11T20:23:23 <Bosmon> Yes, 2 is interesting
2015-08-11T20:23:27 <Bosmon> But what is "reasonable"?
2015-08-11T20:23:42 <colinclark> That someone tested it, and it has been released :)
2015-08-11T20:23:45 <Bosmon> In theory, I just broke a core "Infusion API" again with my most recent commit
2015-08-11T20:23:52 <colinclark> zomg
2015-08-11T20:24:31 <colinclark> Perhaps I should stay on 1.9.x forever
2015-08-11T20:24:39 <colinclark> once someone publishes the thing on npm :P
2015-08-11T20:25:20 <Bosmon> I mean, this change here - https://github.com/amb26/infusion/commit/1a2195c92589c67b9bbc121c7279a3da5bef84aa#diff-eb23eba7203e400016bc578a4faf8ddbR1682
2015-08-11T20:25:23 <Bosmon> Presumably is "breaking"
2015-08-11T20:25:32 <Bosmon> And would cause us to have to immediately move up to infusion 3.x : P
2015-08-11T20:25:45 <colinclark> only once we released it!
2015-08-11T20:25:49 <Bosmon> Sure
2015-08-11T20:26:01 <Bosmon> But I am going to keep doing this for the reasonably forseeable future
2015-08-11T20:26:19 <Bosmon> I think it would be less misleading to be clear that the trunk of infusion, in itself, couldn\'t really be considered "stable"
2015-08-11T20:26:21 <colinclark> Presumably there will also be points in time when people will be rallied together to do a testing spring
2015-08-11T20:26:22 <colinclark> sprint
2015-08-11T20:26:33 <colinclark> at which point, we cut a release
2015-08-11T20:26:53 <colinclark> I guess I\'m arguing that "stable" is relational
2015-08-11T20:26:56 <colinclark> between two versions
2015-08-11T20:27:05 <Bosmon> Given that we have stopped making a distinction between "Infusion" and "Infusion IoC"
2015-08-11T20:27:09 <colinclark> yes
2015-08-11T20:27:22 <Bosmon> When we had APIs, it was relatively clear what constituted an "API breaking change"
2015-08-11T20:27:30 * jhung has quit
2015-08-11T20:27:45 <Bosmon> But the rules for this when most stuff is writtn in declaration would be something we could get together and debate for a couple of weeks
2015-08-11T20:27:49 <Bosmon> When we had a couple of weeks : P
2015-08-11T20:28:07 <colinclark> To be honest, I\'ve sometimes become quite bored of debating these kinds of "rules"
2015-08-11T20:28:13 <Bosmon> Yes
2015-08-11T20:28:31 <colinclark> I\'d like to find some pragmatics
2015-08-11T20:28:33 <Bosmon> ok
2015-08-11T20:28:39 <colinclark> I\'m not saying I\'m right
2015-08-11T20:28:48 <Bosmon> What pragmatics would follow, once we release Infusion 2.0.0?
2015-08-11T20:28:54 <colinclark> I\'m just saying it would be great to not have to do this any more: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/package.json#L9
2015-08-11T20:29:11 <Bosmon> Well sure - but a version number of 2.0.0-beta.1 would do that just fine
2015-08-11T20:30:00 <colinclark> Ok
2015-08-11T20:30:01 <Bosmon> That number, as we established with Justin_o a while back, is entirely semver-compliant
2015-08-11T20:30:15 <colinclark> so the argument, it seems, hinges on how much weight we put on the first digit...
2015-08-11T20:30:22 <colinclark> so let\'s see if I can see if we are otherwise in agreement
2015-08-11T20:30:34 <Bosmon> And also spares us the painful debate on exactly what changes could be permissible in a release named 2.0.0-beta.2
2015-08-11T20:30:40 <Bosmon> SInce the answer is.... "any and all changes" : P
2015-08-11T20:30:56 <colinclark> 1. We will more frequently organize "quick testing sprints" of the sort we did recently for this pull request
2015-08-11T20:31:03 <colinclark> 2. When those succeed, we will cut a "release"
2015-08-11T20:31:17 <colinclark> 3. When we cut a release, we will publish it on npm
2015-08-11T20:31:46 <colinclark> Do those three points at least seem reasonable?
2015-08-11T20:32:37 <Bosmon> colinclark - all of those points are eminently reasonable, yes
2015-08-11T20:32:54 <Bosmon> I would even like to imagine that we could cut releases even more frequently than that
2015-08-11T20:33:20 <colinclark> that would be lovely
2015-08-11T20:33:51 <Bosmon> Perhaps we\'d mark them as alphas or something - although without an actually incrementing main version number, it would be unclear how the alphas and betas related to one another
2015-08-11T20:33:59 * sepideh joined the channel
2015-08-11T20:34:28 <Justin_o> Bosmon, colinclark: we\'d probably need some concept of what changes were made to decide on the release though, there are times when we aren\'t as active as others. so it couldn\'t be purely time based.
2015-08-11T20:34:50 <colinclark> yeah
2015-08-11T20:35:06 <colinclark> what I was suggesting, perhaps implicitly, is that it be "need-based"
2015-08-11T20:35:18 <Justin_o> Bosmon: we\'d have to go alpha -> beta -> otherwise i think we\'d confuse people. Although we don\'t need the in between parts all the time, but they couldn\'t be out of order
2015-08-11T20:38:42 <colinclark> So I guess the main question now is whether we want to go with a long series of betas (alphas?) or whether we want to regularly increase the major version number?
2015-08-11T20:39:01 <Bosmon> yes
2015-08-11T20:39:42 <Bosmon> It\'s a shame that the semver rules are so restrictive - since I think we do have a kind of natural idea of "scale of changes"
2015-08-11T20:39:50 <Bosmon> There will be times, like this one, where "everything breaks"
2015-08-11T20:40:02 <colinclark> yes
2015-08-11T20:40:11 <Bosmon> That is, essentially no code could be relied upon to work without updating
2015-08-11T20:40:20 <Bosmon> And it would be nice to be able to reserve major version updates for these moments
2015-08-11T20:41:13 <Bosmon> That is, rather than "anything breaks" it seems more meaningful to be able to encode "everything breaks"
2015-08-11T20:41:20 <Bosmon> Although I only see one more such moment in our future
2015-08-11T20:41:25 <Bosmon> The great OPTIONS FLATTENING REVOLUTION
2015-08-11T20:41:56 <Bosmon> If we made our upcoming version 2.0.0, it would seem reasonable to make that 3.0.0
2015-08-11T20:42:06 <colinclark> Yeah, it\'s very much like a legal contract
2015-08-11T20:42:23 <colinclark> one typically should avoid signing contracts where possible :P
2015-08-11T20:42:35 <colinclark> especially when money is not involved!
2015-08-11T20:42:39 <Bosmon> ok
2015-08-11T20:43:17 <Bosmon> Well, if we\'re happy to say that we might use version numbers that syntactically comply with semver, without actually signing on to the semver contract, I\'m perfectly happy :)
2015-08-11T20:43:28 <colinclark> :)
2015-08-11T20:43:55 * sepideh has left the channel
2015-08-11T20:45:01 <Justin_o> Bosmon, colinclark: I think it would be good to maintain users expectations of versions. I believe that NPM uses semver, so NPM users would probably expect them to actually be bound to the semver contract
2015-08-11T20:45:38 <colinclark> it\'s funny
2015-08-11T20:45:43 <colinclark> pragmatics here...
2015-08-11T20:46:04 <colinclark> As an npm user, I\'ve essentially learned never to rely on semver from the perspective of automatic dependency management
2015-08-11T20:46:27 <colinclark> I essentially never, every use anything but a literal version number in a dependencies block
2015-08-11T20:46:52 <colinclark> I guess the first time I realized this was crucial was when a minor version was released of a dependency
2015-08-11T20:47:07 <colinclark> and in this minor release, this dependency updated one of its own dependencies
2015-08-11T20:47:18 <colinclark> which caused a conflict with one of my other dependencies
2015-08-11T20:47:38 <colinclark> and users were reporting failures I wasn\'t seeing myself
2015-08-11T20:47:59 <Bosmon> Well, I think perhaps the semantics of the very "patch" version should be dependable on
2015-08-11T20:48:11 <Bosmon> I think people should be able to say ~1.2.3 etc. and for that to mean what it means
2015-08-11T20:48:18 <Bosmon> Depending on ^1.2.3 seems completely insane
2015-08-11T20:48:20 <colinclark> I still don\'t trust a minor update without having actually tested it myself
2015-08-11T20:48:28 <Bosmon> Yes
2015-08-11T20:48:36 <Bosmon> I think it\'s a reasonable position
2015-08-11T20:48:37 <colinclark> it was a ~1.2.3 directive that caused this issue
2015-08-11T20:48:44 <colinclark> and now I just say, literal version numbers or nothing
2015-08-11T20:48:50 <Bosmon> I mean, why actually allow for an update, if it doesn\'t actually update anything?
2015-08-11T20:48:51 <Bosmon> Yes
2015-08-11T20:48:54 <colinclark> And it forms a different kind of contract
2015-08-11T20:48:58 <Bosmon> I think that\'s a reasonable idea
2015-08-11T20:49:05 <colinclark> which says, "Dear users, I have tested with these versions of these dependencies"
2015-08-11T20:49:11 <colinclark> anyway, that\'s arguably not the point
2015-08-11T20:49:29 <colinclark> but I guess it says something about the failure of contracts to actually deliver their stated protections
2015-08-11T20:49:33 <Bosmon> Well quite
2015-08-11T20:49:39 <Bosmon> Since the contact simply can\'t be interpreted
2015-08-11T20:49:49 <colinclark> Speaking of that
2015-08-11T20:49:58 <Bosmon> I argue even that with an API-based system, one\'s ability to determine "what is a breaking change" is still largely illusory
2015-08-11T20:50:05 <colinclark> my interpretation of semver is that you\'re probably on somewhat higher ground, Bosmon
2015-08-11T20:50:28 <colinclark> Section 9 states "A pre-release version indicates that the version is unstable and might not satisfy the intended compatibility requirements as denoted by its associated normal version."
2015-08-11T20:50:35 <colinclark> which appears to be essentially what you\'re saying
2015-08-11T20:50:43 <Bosmon> I think so, yes
2015-08-11T20:50:51 <colinclark> Now, "stability" is also clearly defined
2015-08-11T20:51:11 <Bosmon> Clearly we dream of a day in which Infusion is capable of functioning as a stable base for development outside our community
2015-08-11T20:51:17 <colinclark> "Major version X (X.y.z | X > 0) MUST be incremented if any backwards incompatible changes are introduced to the public API."
2015-08-11T20:51:18 <Bosmon> But I think we\'re pretty clear that that day is still some way off
2015-08-11T20:51:47 <colinclark> well, that\'s not true
2015-08-11T20:51:56 <colinclark> or rather, is an excessively narrow view
2015-08-11T20:51:58 <Bosmon> If we announced a 2.0.0 today, I think we would in effect be announcing that we are happy to support arbitrary development based on Infusion by 3rd parties
2015-08-11T20:52:38 <colinclark> Anyway, it seems clear that this all hinges on whether or not there is a practical interpretation of "major version number"
2015-08-11T20:53:00 <colinclark> if this means, to everyone, "anything with a breaking change," then my browser-style versioning scheme holds

2015-08-11T10:27:15 <the-t-in-rtf1> Does anyone have a handy example of using kettle.test.request.http to POST data?
2015-08-11T10:27:36 <the-t-in-rtf1> I forget the syntax for passing the actual data from the test case and/or request component definition.
2015-08-11T10:30:13 <the-t-in-rtf1> Never mind, found an example in my earlier work:
2015-08-11T10:30:13 <the-t-in-rtf1> {
2015-08-11T10:30:13 <the-t-in-rtf1> func: "{bodyParserRequest}.send",

2015-08-11T12:45:49 <Bosmon2> In answer to your questions, i) I think the large pull should go in as soon as we think is is ready, and ii) yes, I\'ll help to update all the outstanding pull requests which conflict

2015-08-11T12:56:39 <Justin_o> Bosmon2: should i hold off on merging anything in before the big pull request.. i\'m thinking it\'s probably ready to go in now
2015-08-11T12:56:55 <Justin_o> Bosmon2: but will need to talk to colinclark about it when he is online
2015-08-11T12:57:43 <Justin_o> Bosmon: ^
2015-08-11T12:58:29 <Bosmon2> Justin_o - merge whatever you need to now - although hopefully not anything violently conflicting :)
2015-08-11T12:59:18 <Justin_o> Bosmon2: okay.. i\'ll try to check in with colin first to see when he\'ll be able to merge yours in

2015-08-11T13:33:50 <cindyli> Justin_o: i think it tries to get this value - https://github.com/fluid-project/first-discovery/blob/master/src/schemas/schemas.js#L166
2015-08-11T13:36:27 <Justin_o> cindyli: so this is the fallback to use if no language is specified?

2015-08-11T15:12:48 <Justin_o> colinclark: we\'ve done most of the testing tasks for Bosmon2\'s big pull request https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Testing+Tasks
2015-08-11T15:12:58 <colinclark> cool
2015-08-11T15:13:00 <colinclark> how\'s it looking?
2015-08-11T15:13:04 <Justin_o> i\'m not sure we\'ll have time to get to all of the IE ones, but things seemed to have been good
2015-08-11T15:14:00 <Justin_o> colinclark: we did the smoke tests for the IE and it didn\'t turn up anything, so i\'m thinking we\'re good or at least the really noticeable stuff has probably been caught.
2015-08-11T15:14:09 <Justin_o> colinclark: did you want to go ahead and merge it in?
2015-08-11T15:14:39 <colinclark> yeah, I\'ll need to branch first
2015-08-11T15:14:49 <colinclark> and cast an eye over the changes that have fixed the bugs
2015-08-11T15:15:21 * alanharnum has quit
2015-08-11T15:15:26 <Justin_o> colinclark: sure, when do you expect you might be able to get it merged in?
2015-08-11T15:15:32 <cindyli1> Justin_o: it works!! YAY!! thanks
2015-08-11T15:15:53 <colinclark> Justin_o: I dunno
2015-08-11T15:15:55 <colinclark> soon?
2015-08-11T15:15:57 <colinclark> :)
2015-08-11T15:16:16 <Justin_o> cindyli1:  great :)
2015-08-11T15:17:31 <Justin_o> colinclark: we have some other pull requests that are close to being ready or are ready now. We\'re thinking of holding off on merging those to 1) prevent more updates to the branch and 2) to not have to retest it again.
2015-08-11T15:17:40 <colinclark> makes sense to me
2015-08-11T15:17:45 <Justin_o> colinclark: cool
2015-08-11T15:18:45 * alanharnum joined the channel
2015-08-11T15:18:49 <Justin_o> colinclark: if there are a bunch of changes required after you look over the pull again, i guess we might want to get those other pulls in first, but otherwise we\'ll keep them out. Bosmon2 has agreed to help with fixing the conflicts too.
