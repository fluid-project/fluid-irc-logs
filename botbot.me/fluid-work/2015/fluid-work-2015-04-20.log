b'2015-04-20T18:38:50 <Bosmon> We\'ll invent a dedicated syntax for this before long
2015-04-20T18:39:10 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks
2015-04-20T18:39:21 <Justin_o> Bosmon, simonjb: is there a link to the code where this was done?
2015-04-20T18:39:41 <colinclark> Can I ask, only just out of curiosity, what the use case is where you want a uni-directional relay?
2015-04-20T18:39:56 <Justin_o> colinclark: :) i was wondering if someone would ask that
2015-04-20T18:40:04 <simonjb> looking...
2015-04-20T18:40:08 <Justin_o> simonjb: thanks
2015-04-20T18:40:21 <colinclark> Justin_o: I\'m just trying to learn more about how people are actually using model relay in practice
2015-04-20T18:40:25 <colinclark> having not used it a ton myself yet
2015-04-20T18:40:26 <Justin_o> colinclark: so for the keyboard panel in the first discovery tool, we have a keyboardInput component which is created after render
2015-04-20T18:40:36 <colinclark> ok
2015-04-20T18:40:39 <jhung> anastasiac: I merged your pull req.
2015-04-20T18:40:46 <anastasiac> yay!
2015-04-20T18:40:48 <anastasiac> thanks
2015-04-20T18:41:34 <Justin_o> colinclark:  we also have an "assistance" component which is created when we need to offer the user some assistance (i.e. sticky keys).
2015-04-20T18:41:41 <simonjb> Justin_o, Bosmon, colinclark: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/gpii-oauth2/gpii-oauth2-authz-server/public/src/components/privacySettings/js/EditPrivacySettings.js#L218-L225
2015-04-20T18:41:47 <Justin_o> simonjb: thanks
2015-04-20T18:42:23 <Justin_o> colinclark: when this is created we need to relay the adjuster value from the "assistance" to the keyboardInput component to enabled/disable the stickyKey feature
2015-04-20T18:42:37 <colinclark> ok
2015-04-20T18:43:23 <Justin_o> colinclark: specifically in my case i\'m finding that if it is bi-directional the initial model value from the keyboardInput is overriding the default value of the adjuster, however I\'d want it to be the other way around
2015-04-20T18:43:43 <colinclark> aha, ok
2015-04-20T18:43:44 <colinclark> that makes sense
2015-04-20T18:43:52 <Bosmon> Justin_o - if it\'s just an initial value problem, you should make sure to reflect that in the relay definition
2015-04-20T18:44:15 <Justin_o> Bosmon: sure.. backward: liveOnly for example?
2015-04-20T18:44:25 <Bosmon> Justin_o - exactly
2015-04-20T18:44:54 <Bosmon> It\'s funny, all these wierd hedges about init and live semantics I had thought were just an annoyance when they were implemented
2015-04-20T18:45:00 <Bosmon> But they have turned out to be absolutely essential
2015-04-20T18:45:06 * danaayotte has quit
2015-04-20T18:46:38 <Justin_o> Bosmon:  :) it\'s a good thing you put all these features in
2015-04-20T18:46:42 <Bosmon> Justin_o, simonjb - I wrote an example at the end of the "Nexus API" page over the weekend: http://wiki.gpii.net/w/Nexus_API
2015-04-20T18:46:51 <Bosmon> Where the relay requires "liveOnly" in one direction and "initOnly" in the other
2015-04-20T18:47:03 <Bosmon> Because you could say that "the two integral models differ by a constant of integration" : P
2015-04-20T18:47:43 <Bosmon> I had a good chat with a fine chap here, KELLS, who is cited on that page, in which it came out that this relationship between "integral models" and "integration" is more than just an analogy
2015-04-20T18:48:36 <Bosmon> In that to an FRP enthusiast, they might say that "the integral of an event stream is a behaviour"
2015-04-20T18:48:51 <Bosmon> And what we call "models" are what they would call "behaviours"
2015-04-20T18:49:10 <Bosmon> So, say you have a stream of "click" events which have been integrated into an integer count
2015-04-20T18:49:21 <Bosmon> And then you have a toggle switch which just has boolean values
2015-04-20T18:49:44 <Bosmon> The two models are clearly related by a very straighforward relay rules - that just says that toggle = count % 2
2015-04-20T18:49:52 <Bosmon> But what is unknown is the PHASE which links the models together
2015-04-20T18:50:18 <Bosmon> And, you certainly don\'t want a toggle switch with the very unwelcome "behaviour" that it toggles itself as soon as someone starts attaching to it
2015-04-20T18:50:51 <Bosmon> So we need an "initOnly" relationship going OUT to the click stream that lets it acquire the correct initial phase
2015-04-20T18:51:03 <Bosmon> And then a "liveOnly" relationship going BACK to the toggle switch that lets it react to the clicks
2015-04-20T18:51:36 <Bosmon> So our relationship ACTUALLY reads...... toggle = count % 2 + c
2015-04-20T18:51:45 <Bosmon> Where c is an "unknown constant of integration" just in the classical sense
2015-04-20T18:52:21 <Justin_o> Bosmon: interesting
2015-04-20T18:56:02 <jhung> anastasiac: I added a new pull req for that styling issue. https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/pull/60

2015-04-20T20:21:23 <cindyli> hi Bosmon
2015-04-20T20:21:32 <Bosmon> Hi there cindyli
2015-04-20T20:21:55 <cindyli> a big question is, how can i use fluid.selectable()
2015-04-20T20:21:57 <cindyli> what i did
2015-04-20T20:22:13 <cindyli> i placed "selectable" selector on all the inputs
2015-04-20T20:22:51 <cindyli> and passing the parent div selector of all these inputs as the first argument to fluid.selectable()
2015-04-20T20:23:03 <cindyli> with the 2nd argument {noWrap: true}
2015-04-20T20:23:17 <cindyli> the result is, all inputs become unselectable
2015-04-20T20:24:42 <cindyli> if I change the first argument to all these inputs, these inputs cannot use arrow keys to navigate thru
2015-04-20T20:25:14 <cindyli> it seems the first method makes more sense
2015-04-20T20:25:34 <cindyli> do you have an idea where I did wrong, Bosmon
2015-04-20T20:26:18 <Bosmon> Justin_o, anastasiac - perhaps you can help
2015-04-20T20:26:28 <Bosmon> I\'m sure you\'re familiar with the selectable plugin :)
2015-04-20T20:26:48 <cindyli> ok, i will check with them first
2015-04-20T20:27:06 <cindyli> or create a simple test page to play with
2015-04-20T20:27:41 <Bosmon> We really need to turn this into a proper Fluid component at some point
2015-04-20T20:27:47 <Bosmon> Rather than a jQuery UI plugin
2015-04-20T20:27:51 <Bosmon> but it should at least work : P
2015-04-20T20:28:28 <cindyli> agree :)
2015-04-20T20:29:01 <Bosmon> we even have a tutorial :)
2015-04-20T20:29:02 <Bosmon> http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/docs/Tutorial+-+Keyboard+Accessibility+Plugin

2015-04-20T15:52:54 <Justin_o> danaayotte: yep, that worked, thanks
2015-04-20T15:53:09 <Justin_o> simonjb: ^
2015-04-20T15:53:11 <Bosmon> I think the modelising ones are reasonably straightforward
2015-04-20T15:53:28 <Bosmon> It would be nice to gain a general "scrollIntoView" operation out of this at some point since I know we need one for our documentation site
2015-04-20T15:54:17 <Bosmon> cindyli - had you experimented with the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/scrollIntoView operation?
2015-04-20T15:54:45 <Bosmon> I guess it\'s the animation in particular that we\'re after, which seems to be nonportable
2015-04-20T15:57:38 * jhernandez has quit
2015-04-20T15:58:00 <cindyli> Bosmon: yes, i had a look on that. it doesn\'t seem to be able to achieve the design scrolling behavior. The design requires when buttons are scrolled into the view, they must be at the proper positions to avoid the top or bottom buttons to be shown in partial. So basically buttons need to be scrolled to very precise positions
2015-04-20T16:02:52 <Bosmon> ok, cool
2015-04-20T16:03:03 <Bosmon> It sounds like there is a good opportunity for a generic plugin then

2015-04-20T16:36:48 <cindyli> does the test look ok to you?
2015-04-20T16:37:11 <Bosmon> cindyli - we can\'t use "paths" in relay documents
2015-04-20T16:37:18 <Bosmon> You just need to embed a reference to the argument
2015-04-20T16:37:33 <cindyli> ah ok
2015-04-20T16:37:35 <Bosmon> e.g. left: "{that}.model.value" etc
2015-04-20T16:37:41 <cindyli> trying
2015-04-20T16:39:25 <cindyli> Bosmon: modified - http://pastebin.com/8vfkJ78j, same issue
2015-04-20T16:39:48 <Bosmon> cindyli - you still called it "leftPath"
2015-04-20T16:39:59 <Bosmon> None of the options named "xxxPath" can be used with relay documents
2015-04-20T16:40:06 <Bosmon> YOu just have to treat them as actual values
2015-04-20T16:40:32 <cindyli> ok, i see, left and right
2015-04-20T16:40:40 <cindyli> without the keyword "path"
2015-04-20T16:40:44 <Bosmon> yup
2015-04-20T16:41:15 <cindyli> super, that works. thanks, Bosmon
2015-04-20T16:41:19 <Bosmon> great :)
2015-04-20T16:42:57 <cindyli> Bosmon: either we need a documentation for it, or use consistent keywords for regular transformation and model relay transformation
2015-04-20T16:43:47 <Bosmon> cindyli - certainly
2015-04-20T16:44:44 <Bosmon> In theory we could eliminate all the xxxPath stuff, and use a form of IoC to resolve references of the form {document}.path
2015-04-20T16:44:48 <Bosmon> But that would be quite a rewrite
2015-04-20T16:45:13 <Bosmon> Another option is to have the relay system detect and reject any attempt to refer to xxxPath
2015-04-20T16:45:32 <Bosmon> And better documentation, of course, is never bad to have
2015-04-20T16:59:12 <colinclark> When are the xxxPath properties used, if not in relay?
2015-04-20T16:59:33 <Bosmon> colinclark - they are used in standard model transformations
2015-04-20T16:59:39 <Bosmon> That transform documents to documents
2015-04-20T17:00:08 <colinclark> and they refer to there to paths into the source document?
2015-04-20T17:00:15 <Bosmon> colinclark - yes
2015-04-20T17:00:32 <colinclark> but then the relay system functions differently enough that they can\'t be used?
2015-04-20T17:00:36 <colinclark> or rather, it seems like, needn\'t be used?
2015-04-20T17:00:44 <Bosmon> Mustn\'t be used
2015-04-20T17:01:03 <Bosmon> The relay system causes the transform to believe that everything consists of directly supplied values

2015-04-20T18:36:16 <Justin_o> Bosmon: hello, do you have a minute for a modelRelay question?
2015-04-20T18:36:33 <Bosmon> Hi there Justin_o
2015-04-20T18:36:47 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks
2015-04-20T18:37:10 <Justin_o> so i have something like this
2015-04-20T18:37:30 <Justin_o> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/6SM1nOEJ
2015-04-20T18:38:09 <Justin_o> however, i only want this to work in one direction
2015-04-20T18:38:32 <Bosmon> Justin_o - currently the only way to achieve this is to turn it into an explicit relay using fluid.identity
2015-04-20T18:38:38 <Bosmon> simonjb had just the same issue last week
