b'2015-06-25T17:23:25 <Justin_o> Bosmon: this works too https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-1175
2015-06-25T17:23:28 <Bosmon> Yes
2015-06-25T17:23:37 <Justin_o> but it is strange that the odd one is up
2015-06-25T17:25:28 * michelled joined the channel
2015-06-25T17:25:30 <gtirloni> that address is pointing to the same IP where issues.gpii.net is hosted
2015-06-25T17:26:03 <Bosmon> gtirloni - can we safely get rid of it?
2015-06-25T17:26:21 <gtirloni> the guys from utoronto can/could
2015-06-25T17:26:33 <Bosmon> urk
2015-06-25T17:26:40 <gtirloni> i mailed their tech contact a month or so ago about deleting *.atrc.utoronto.ca.. no answer.
2015-06-25T17:26:45 <Bosmon> oh dear
2015-06-25T17:27:29 * michelled joined the channel
2015-06-25T17:27:53 <gtirloni> the ip\'s they are pointing to (for other websites too) will all cease to be used in a few weeks so it\'ll all stop working anyway
2015-06-25T17:27:59 <Bosmon> Oh, that\'s great
2015-06-25T17:28:23 <Bosmon> Cheers, gtirloni
2015-06-25T17:28:26 <gtirloni> :(
2015-06-25T17:28:27 <gtirloni> :)
2015-06-25T17:28:29 <gtirloni> oops
2015-06-25T17:28:59 <Bosmon> I guess we\'d have a hard job trying to argue to ICANN that we want to reclaim ownership of *.atrc.utoronto.ca : P

2015-06-25T19:21:48 <colinclark> simonjb and gtirloni, I\'m just chatting with kasparnet about performance testing the Preferences Server
2015-06-25T19:22:12 <colinclark> and ultimately the Auth Server + CBFM + Preferences Server
2015-06-25T19:22:27 <colinclark> kasparnet\'s advice was to use the master branch of universal, not the older review3 branch
2015-06-25T19:22:36 <colinclark> which he believes is actually the version currently deployed for pilot testing
2015-06-25T19:22:40 <gtirloni> ok
2015-06-25T19:23:39 <colinclark> gtirloni: The biggest thing that has changed from our tests a few years ago to now is the preference set format
2015-06-25T19:23:45 <colinclark> and I think avtar\'s tests used specific preference sets
2015-06-25T19:23:51 <colinclark> I can\'t remember which ones, though
2015-06-25T19:24:05 <colinclark> and whether we\'ll need to update them or if they\'ll already be in our stable of pre-existing sets
2015-06-25T19:24:25 <colinclark> once we get to phase 2, were we\'re testing the full workflow, we\'ll need preference sets that include privacy policies
2015-06-25T19:24:31 <colinclark> which I think simonjb said he\'d help make
2015-06-25T19:25:03 <kasparnet> colinclark, gtirloni: yeah - the privacy policies, I\'m pretty ignorant on
2015-06-25T19:25:47 <colinclark> there\'s even a bit of a UI to make them with now :)
2015-06-25T19:27:21 <avtar> gtirloni: regarding the specific preference sets you can grep this https://gist.github.com/avtar/4a13f34346f9b54a49b4 for "/user/" to get a list
2015-06-25T19:28:15 <gtirloni> ok.. 14 entries
2015-06-25T19:28:34 <gtirloni> i know nothing about anything so i\'m still figuring out how it all works
2015-06-25T19:29:20 <gtirloni> gpii-universal-201308231010-3.noarch.rpm  .. is it better to replace this with a `git clone` to get the latest code then?
2015-06-25T19:30:02 <avtar> it\'s better to replace that but with docker-universal
2015-06-25T19:30:05 <simonjb> yes colinclark, gtirloni, avtar, kasparnet: I can help with privacy policies
2015-06-25T19:30:37 <colinclark> I think this is probably already clear, but just in case I\'m confused I\'ll type it here and people can say "you\'re crazy, colinclark!"
2015-06-25T19:30:49 <colinclark> So we\'ll do a two-phased approach
2015-06-25T19:30:54 <avtar> gtirloni: we can chat on vidyo if that will help you get set up faster
2015-06-25T19:31:17 <colinclark> 1. gtirloni will get set up to test just the preferences server, gather some results, and we\'ll see how long it took and assess if it\'s worth testing more
2015-06-25T19:31:41 <colinclark> 2. if it is worth testing more, simonjb and gtirloni will update the test scripts and the deployment configuration to test the Auth Server + CBFM + PS configuration
2015-06-25T19:31:46 <gtirloni> avtar: ok, whenever you\'re free
2015-06-25T19:31:47 <colinclark> that\'s sensible, right?
2015-06-25T19:32:36 <simonjb> seems reasonable to me
2015-06-25T19:32:41 <avtar> yup
2015-06-25T19:37:18 <colinclark> ok, cool
2015-06-25T20:01:34 * clown joined the channel
2015-06-25T20:03:50 <avtar> colinclark, gtirloni: here\'s http://blog.flowdock.com/2015/06/22/debugging-node-js-memory-leaks/ the how to debug nodejs memory leaks article that i was talking about yesterday
2015-06-25T20:04:32 <avtar> with two more posts that contain additional information on the tools mentioned in the flowdock post http://www.willvillanueva.com/the-node-js-profiling-guide-that-hasnt-existed-finding-the-cause-of-a-memory-leak-using-heap-snapshots-part-3/ and http://www.nearform.com/nodecrunch/self-detect-memory-leak-node/
2015-06-25T20:05:22 <avtar> and i believe this https://code.google.com/p/v8/issues/detail?id=847 is the v8 issue the first post is alluding to

2015-06-25T15:11:36 <Justin_o> jhung: for forcing the inclusion of a header into the ToC can you see a reason why you\'d want to do that for a heading that was invisible?
2015-06-25T15:11:44 <Justin_o> i.e. was hidden
2015-06-25T15:13:36 <jhung> Justin_o: you mean a heading has display:hidden style but also has "flc-toc-include"  on the element?
2015-06-25T15:14:02 <Justin_o> jhung: something like that yes
2015-06-25T15:14:16 <Justin_o> or maybe it\'s parent is display:none or something
2015-06-25T15:14:35 <Justin_o> i\'m thinking we still wouldn\'t include it
2015-06-25T15:15:23 <jhung> yeah I don\'t see a reason to break the expected behaviour. A hidden / display:none element should not be included regardless.
2015-06-25T15:15:29 <jhung> ^Justin_o
2015-06-25T15:15:33 <Justin_o> jhung: thanks
2015-06-25T15:17:55 <michelled> jhung: are you able to make some changes to content on the IDRC and IDI sites?

2015-06-25T15:18:23 <jhung> sorry I misread.
2015-06-25T15:18:37 <jhung> Yes, I can make changes to those sites michelled. What\'s up?
2015-06-25T15:19:02 <michelled> jutta wants some news up there
2015-06-25T15:19:06 <michelled> I\'ll forward the email to you

2015-06-25T17:20:41 <Bosmon> You may like to rip off parts of it to put in a utility that you could use whilst we\'re waiting for the proper renderer
2015-06-25T17:20:46 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay, i could probably write something like that for the chartAuthoring tool i guess
