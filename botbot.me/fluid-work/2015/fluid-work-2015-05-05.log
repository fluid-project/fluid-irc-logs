2015-05-05T18:11:56 <Bosmon> Hi there Justin_o
2015-05-05T18:12:04 <Bosmon> Could you say a little more about your if (that.tooltip) branch?
2015-05-05T18:12:05 <Justin_o> Bosmon: hello
2015-05-05T18:13:21 <Justin_o> Bosmon: sure
2015-05-05T18:14:08 <Bosmon> ah well, it\'s ok actually
2015-05-05T18:14:17 <Bosmon> I was going to ask why it wasn\'t expressed as a model relay rule
2015-05-05T18:14:25 <Bosmon> but the answer is obviously that it is impossible :)
2015-05-05T18:14:30 <Justin_o> Bosmon: so at least part of the issue is that when we change preferences it causes the entire prefsEditor to be re-rendered. So the panel gets re-rendered. When this happens the subcomponents of the keyboard panel are re-initialized
2015-05-05T18:14:39 <Justin_o> ah okay :)
2015-05-05T18:14:59 <Bosmon> We don\'t yet support rules with variable targets
2015-05-05T18:15:07 <Bosmon> Although it would be quite easy
2015-05-05T18:15:41 <Bosmon> Also, "a future version of the framework" will aggressively call fluid.allocateSimpleId on anything it can get its hands on
2015-05-05T18:15:57 <Justin_o> Bosmon: what will this do for us?
2015-05-05T18:16:01 <Justin_o> faster location?
2015-05-05T18:16:14 <Bosmon> Not so much that, as be able to depend that everything has an id
2015-05-05T18:16:30 <Justin_o> ah okay, so that we don\'t have to manually call
2015-05-05T18:16:35 <Justin_o> it
2015-05-05T18:16:41 <Justin_o> fluid.allocateSimpleId
2015-05-05T18:16:59 <Bosmon> And then the ability to express what you wrote there as a model relay targetted at target: ["idToContent", "{that}.dom.accommodationToggle.id"]
2015-05-05T18:17:04 <Bosmon> btw you have a typo there
2015-05-05T18:17:08 <Bosmon> Two "m" in accommodation
2015-05-05T18:18:46 <Bosmon> However I think that we should do something about cindyli\'s comment, and it is worth splitting this model listener up into two
2015-05-05T18:19:48 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay i\'ll look into that
2015-05-05T18:19:55 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i have a question about your comment for https://github.com/fluid-project/first-discovery/pull/39#discussion_r29691038
2015-05-05T18:20:20 <Justin_o> is there a way to use the simplified form of model relay to relay multiple things from the same source?
2015-05-05T18:20:30 <Justin_o> or do i always have to use the modelRelay block for this?
2015-05-05T18:20:32 <Bosmon> Justin_o - there isn\'t, no
2015-05-05T18:20:39 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay.. thanks
2015-05-05T18:20:40 <Bosmon> Currently you have to use a full block in many situations
2015-05-05T18:21:16 <Bosmon> BUT... it all depends on what you think is the source, and which the target
2015-05-05T18:21:23 <Justin_o> Bosmon: right
2015-05-05T18:21:31 <Bosmon> I think it would be perfectly reasonable to split this relay into two, and send it into the individual components
2015-05-05T18:22:21 <Bosmon> One part can go in "assistance" and the other in "keyboardInput"
2015-05-05T18:22:32 <Bosmon> This might even be a bit more natural
2015-05-05T18:22:52 <Bosmon> That is, to just write it as two implicit rules, one in each component
2015-05-05T18:23:30 <Justin_o> Bosmon: wouldn\'t there be an issue with the createOnEvent
2015-05-05T18:23:42 <Bosmon> Justin_o - how so?
2015-05-05T18:23:46 <Justin_o> since the assistance component isn\'t created till the assistance is actually needed
2015-05-05T18:24:05 <Bosmon> Justin_o - ah, I see
2015-05-05T18:24:13 <Bosmon> Ok
2015-05-05T18:24:17 * sepideh has quit
2015-05-05T18:24:22 <Bosmon> So much to achieve in the "future framework" :)
2015-05-05T18:24:27 <Justin_o> :)
2015-05-05T18:24:35 <Justin_o> looking forward tot he async ginger world
2015-05-05T18:24:37 * sepideh joined the channel
2015-05-05T18:24:39 <Justin_o> to the
2015-05-05T18:24:43 <Bosmon> Yes
2015-05-05T18:25:03 <Bosmon> A side-effect of async ginger will be the ability to write arbitrary IoCSS references everywhere were we can currently only write conventional ones
2015-05-05T18:25:22 <Bosmon> This is what I was referring to with my "{keyboard&panel}" point
2015-05-05T18:25:50 <Justin_o> Bosmon: ah, i was wondering what that syntax meant
2015-05-05T18:26:13 <Bosmon> It\'s actually legal already - but only in the "target" of distributeOptions, currently
2015-05-05T18:27:48 <Justin_o> oh, what does it mean exactly
2015-05-05T18:28:05 <Bosmon> It just means that both context names have to match at the same place
2015-05-05T18:28:15 <Justin_o> oh i see
2015-05-05T18:28:22 <Justin_o> cool
2015-05-05T18:32:03 <Bosmon> Certainly all modelRelay rules should use the IoCSS semantic... meaning, "keep this relationship in place for as long as both endpoints exist"
2015-05-05T18:32:19 <Justin_o> that makes sense
2015-05-05T18:35:51 <Justin_o> Bosmon: in regards to cindyli\'s comment, how were you thinking of splitting the modelListener into two
2015-05-05T18:35:53 <Justin_o> ?
2015-05-05T18:36:30 <Bosmon> Justin_o - one part which runs initOnly and the other part which runs all the time
2015-05-05T18:37:29 <Justin_o> Bosmon: oh okay
