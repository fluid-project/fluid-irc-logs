2015-03-11T13:52:03 <cindyli> hi kasparnet
2015-03-11T13:52:11 <kasparnet> morning cindyli
2015-03-11T13:52:40 <cindyli> kasparnet: a few of us are creating a screen cast for the security work. one part looks like this - https://www.dropbox.com/s/1neiaaofg9q5by3/security%20and%20OER%20screencast-02.jpg?dl=0
2015-03-11T13:53:01 <cindyli> i heard that you guys had shown something like this in the committe review meeting
2015-03-11T13:53:24 <anastasiac> jhung, I\xe2\x80\x99ve just build the epub from your FLOE-240-2 branch, and the sim doesn\xe2\x80\x99t at all load in iBooks or Lucifox
2015-03-11T13:54:09 <cindyli> basically, clicking on the "settings" would direct you to the prefs authentication page, kasparnet. do you know which branch or what code I can use to set up this process?
2015-03-11T13:54:42 <jhung> anastasiac: really? Let me get a clean checkout and see.
2015-03-11T13:54:43 * clown joined the channel
2015-03-11T13:56:19 <cindyli> kasparnet: you may have noticed, in the link i sent u, the "settings" selection is from PMT
2015-03-11T14:00:00 * danaayotte joined the channel
2015-03-11T14:03:17 <jhung> anastasiac: it works for me. I checked the directories using diff and there aren\'t any differences.
2015-03-11T14:03:46 <anastasiac> So jhung, you opened the epub in iBooks and the sim was there?
2015-03-11T14:03:50 <jhung> yep
2015-03-11T14:04:05 <anastasiac> what vesion of ibooks, and what version of osx?
2015-03-11T14:05:00 <jhung> anastasiac: iBooks 1.1.1 (600). OS X 10.10.2
2015-03-11T14:05:12 <anastasiac> and same questions for Lucifox, which doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work for me
2015-03-11T14:05:17 <anastasiac> ah, different versions.
2015-03-11T14:05:20 <anastasiac> interesting
2015-03-11T14:05:38 <jhung> anastasiac: I\'m not using Lucifox. I\'ve been using Readium. Lucifox never really worked for me.
2015-03-11T14:05:49 * slim_jim joined the channel
2015-03-11T14:07:57 <kasparnet> cindyli: I think it should be in the "review3" branch of the prefsEditors repository
2015-03-11T14:08:41 <cindyli> will try that. thanks, kasparnet
2015-03-11T14:09:00 <kasparnet> cindyli: cool - let me know if it\'s not working or if there\'s something you cant find)
2015-03-11T14:09:24 <cindyli> sure, kasparnet
2015-03-11T14:20:40 <cindyli> kasparnet: i\'ve set up the review3 branch in my machine. On the PMT demo page, clicking on the "account" link at the bottom directs me to the oauth authentification login page (url: http://205.211.169.224:8081/login). do you have a sample user for this login?
2015-03-11T14:21:41 <kasparnet> I dont remember it.. perhaps simonjb or sgithens______ might?
2015-03-11T14:24:08 <simonjb> cindyli, kasparnet: the configured test users are in https://github.com/simonbates/universal/blob/review3-GPII-17/examples/easit-oauth-integration/EasitTestOauthDatastore.js
2015-03-11T14:24:18 <simonjb> users section of the model
2015-03-11T14:24:43 <cindyli> thanks, simonjb
2015-03-11T14:24:49 <anastasiac> jhung, I\xe2\x80\x99m still on OS X 10.9, and iBooks is still at 1.0.1 \xe2\x80\x93\xc2\xa0and I can\xe2\x80\x99t seem to upgrade iBooks. This implies that our EPUB (at least the sim part) is dependent on Yosemite\xe2\x80\xa6
2015-03-11T14:25:03 * danaayotte has quit
2015-03-11T14:26:11 <jhung> anastasiac: That\'s not good. I wonder if we can have a fallback?
2015-03-11T14:26:25 <anastasiac> what are you thinking, jhung?
2015-03-11T14:26:39 <anastasiac> at least it works in Readium...
2015-03-11T14:27:27 <jhung> anastasiac: Maybe file a jira and put a note on the ILDH?
2015-03-11T14:27:31 <jhung> And leave it as is for now?
2015-03-11T14:27:45 <anastasiac> hm...
2015-03-11T14:28:10 <anastasiac> Has PhET shared any thoughts on what platforms they test on or expect things to work on?
2015-03-11T14:30:02 * Sepideh has quit
2015-03-11T14:30:08 <jhung> anastasiac: I\'m not familiar with their testing process or their supported platforms.
2015-03-11T14:30:26 <jhung> EPUB3 is completely different though
2015-03-11T14:32:40 <anastasiac> yeah
2015-03-11T14:32:52 <anastasiac> jhung, have you run the epub through a validator?
2015-03-11T14:32:59 * simonjb has quit
2015-03-11T14:33:38 <anastasiac> http://validator.idpf.org/
2015-03-11T14:33:51 <jhung> yes I used epubcheck anastasiac. Just warnings
2015-03-11T14:33:58 <anastasiac> ok
2015-03-11T14:33:59 <anastasiac> hm
2015-03-11T14:34:04 <anastasiac> <sigh>
2015-03-11T14:36:34 <jhung> Do you think it\'d be okay to test just on OS X 10.10 with latest iBooks anastasiac?
2015-03-11T14:36:46 * colinclark joined the channel
2015-03-11T14:37:01 <anastasiac> dunno, jhung. This might want to be a discussion with a few more people
2015-03-11T14:37:17 <anastasiac> I\xe2\x80\x99ll check in with michelled when she gets off her call

2015-03-11T14:59:55 <Justin_o> but am getting an error when i try to start

2015-03-11T15:00:08 <Justin_o> kasparnet: any ideas?

2015-03-11T15:09:51 <kasparnet> oops Justin_o *

2015-03-11T15:17:46 <Justin_o> kasparnet: are there things that need to be installed outside of the grunt commands?
2015-03-11T15:28:19 <kasparnet> jhernandez: ^ does that ring any bells to you?
2015-03-11T15:28:25 <clown> Justin_o, kasparnet:  FWW, I always follow:  http://wiki.gpii.net/w/Setting_Up_Your_Development_Environment#Fedora_Installation_Instructions
2015-03-11T15:28:38 <clown> *FWIW
2015-03-11T15:28:51 <kasparnet> Justin_o: yeah, I agree that that one might be more current/detailed
2015-03-11T15:29:34 <clown> kasparnet, Justin_o: I\'ve recently followed those directions for a F21 VM with no hiccups.
2015-03-11T15:30:10 * yzen_ joined the channel
2015-03-11T15:32:37 <clown> looking over the two sets of instructions, the wiki page begins with a bunch of "basic" linux development packages that must be installed (e.g., gcc and glib-devel, and others).
2015-03-11T15:33:31 <clown> later, where the wiki outlines how to install grunt, and how to run the build \xe2\x80\x94 that part looks the same as the readme.md
2015-03-11T15:33:53 <clown> kasparnet, Justin_o ^
2015-03-11T15:36:47 <clown> on another note, kasparnet, I added a comment to pull 246.  I don\'t know if you saw it:  https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/246#issuecomment-77381217

2015-03-11T16:03:37 <clown> Justin_o: my guess is "no".
2015-03-11T16:03:50 <colinclark> kasparnet: an hour early?
2015-03-11T16:03:55 <colinclark> ok with me
2015-03-11T16:03:58 <kasparnet> since we have most architecture people in US timezone
2015-03-11T16:04:09 <colinclark> I\'m not sure Bosmon is around, but I guess that\'s cool
2015-03-11T16:04:10 <kasparnet> well.. I guess it\'s 50/50 ish?
2015-03-11T16:04:26 <colinclark> yeah, I think we\'re pretty evenly split across time zones
2015-03-11T16:04:29 <kasparnet> yeah
2015-03-11T16:04:33 <kasparnet> I\'m fine with either
2015-03-11T16:04:39 <colinclark> I am as well
2015-03-11T16:04:55 <clown> Justion_o, a quick look at the grunt script confirms my intuition.
2015-03-11T16:06:37 <jhernandez> Justin_o: sorry, just seen this
