b'2015-09-16T14:03:25 <the-t-in-rtf> For most people, pouch is the big ticket item.  Some people could probably use the test mail server as well.
2015-09-16T14:03:38 <the-t-in-rtf> The lucene test library is mostly for the UL and PTD.

2015-09-16T14:04:33 <colinclark> this is exciting
2015-09-16T14:05:30 <the-t-in-rtf> Zombie is also interesting, but I\'m not ready to inflict that on anyone else until we can spike better keyboard simulation and tame its promisory nature a bit.
2015-09-16T14:06:16 <the-t-in-rtf> Yeah, I think I need to schedule my coffee break at 16:00 CET and just hop on the board.  I get used to it being empty all day and forget you guys are here.  This has been fun and useful!
2015-09-16T14:06:17 <the-t-in-rtf> :)
2015-09-16T14:08:24 <colinclark> hey alanharnum, there\'s kind of an interesting note in these meeting notes from yesterday: https://wiki.gpii.net/w/CouchDB_security_persistence_2015-09-14
2015-09-16T14:08:41 <colinclark> "I currently have NO IDEA how anyone currently knows how to commission a new CouchDB server for use with our prefs server - and we should try to find out"
2015-09-16T14:08:53 <colinclark> I wonder if you could, at some point, help answer that question?
2015-09-16T14:13:27 <alanharnum> colinclark: sounds legit
2015-09-16T14:13:42 <alanharnum> & part of the larger "how do we provision new infrastructure" question
2015-09-16T14:13:43 <Bosmon> Cheers, WAHARNUM :)
2015-09-16T14:13:50 <colinclark> alanharnum: Yes
2015-09-16T14:13:58 <colinclark> I\'m hoping there is someone in the universe who can answer that question
2015-09-16T14:14:01 <colinclark> document it
2015-09-16T14:14:18 <colinclark> and describe what is being done to make it even easier and clearer :)
2015-09-16T14:15:04 <alanharnum> i am assuming there\'s a desire here for a more robust long-term answer than "you ask gtirloni to do it" :)
2015-09-16T14:16:13 * gtirloni hides
2015-09-16T14:16:34 <alanharnum> no need to hide gtirloni
2015-09-16T14:16:36 <gtirloni> i\'m a bit behind schedule in answering that question myself
2015-09-16T14:16:59 <alanharnum> or at least i need to hide with you :P
2015-09-16T14:18:12 <colinclark> haha
2015-09-16T14:18:14 <colinclark> :)
2015-09-16T14:22:24 <gtirloni> it\'d be interesting to know if there is something Out There that already provides a nice self-service interface to provisioning containers in platform $x, while caring about authentication, container ownership, resource limits, etc
2015-09-16T14:23:36 <alanharnum> there\'s a pretty massive laundry list of KVM management tools at http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Management_Tools
2015-09-16T14:25:49 <simonjb> the-t-in-rtf: when we were chatting earlier, I hadn\'t seen your email to the GPII Architecture list regarding user management
2015-09-16T14:25:56 <simonjb> I\'m looking at your notes now
2015-09-16T14:27:08 <the-t-in-rtf> Great, thanks.  I am reading links that you all are sending around and will likely start writing basic stuff again tomorrow.
2015-09-16T14:31:56 <gtirloni> alanharnum, colinclark: i think it\'s worth investigating the concept of a pod in kubernetes and how an app can be represented by that. then it\'s a matter of someone choosing a given pod configuration (app+mongo+etc..) and specifying how many should be up. then "it\'s just a matter" of tying that into a load balancer :)
2015-09-16T14:32:09 <simonjb> the-t-in-rtf: I see your notes on the HTTP API and I\'m wondering would the new work integrate with Express as middleware or is it used in a different way? For the OAuth 2 work, we currently use the passport and oauth2orize middleware to do user authentication and OAuth 2 authentication respectively. And I was wondering how these things might fit together?
2015-09-16T14:32:37 <alanharnum> gtirloni colinclark: yeah - I think Kubernetes is probably the future on this once we have some time to dig in & experiment
2015-09-16T14:35:26 * slim_ joined the channel
2015-09-16T14:40:39 <simonjb> the-t-in-rtf: for example, we use passport to specify that to access a certain web page, the user has to be logged in, and passport with redirect the user to a login page, if needed https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/gpii-oauth2/gpii-oauth2-authz-server/src/AuthServer.js#L471-L479
2015-09-16T14:45:30 <simonjb> the-t-in-rtf: would we write a passport strategy that delegates to the HTTP API outlined on https://github.com/the-t-in-rtf/gpii-express-user/blob/master/src/docs/api.md?
2015-09-16T14:47:19 <Justin_o> jhung: I\'ve filed a couple pull requests one each against your docs-template and docs-core repos. to address FLUID-5746
2015-09-16T14:48:26 <jhung> excellent Justin_o. I\'ll check them out.
2015-09-16T14:48:49 <Justin_o> jhung: thanks, let me know if they are okay
2015-09-16T14:49:07 <jhung> ok
2015-09-16T14:51:25 <the-t-in-rtf> @simonjb, middleware is the right fit, and there could be a redirect to a login page backed by the new API.  Unless I am really misunderstanding things, I think we would just need to work together on expanding the login and logout API I\'ve outlined to take care of letting the passport middleware know that the current user is now logged in (or logged out).
2015-09-16T14:51:42 <the-t-in-rtf> Happy to sit down and review it together after the F2F.
2015-09-16T14:53:08 <simonjb> sounds good the-t-in-rtf

2015-09-16T13:22:47 <the-t-in-rtf> Does anyone have a recommendation for a good caching library?
2015-09-16T13:23:07 <the-t-in-rtf> I want one that a) times out stuff and b) limits its own size
2015-09-16T13:23:14 <the-t-in-rtf> This is the closest I\'ve found thus far:  https://www.npmjs.com/package/cache-manager
2015-09-16T13:24:49 <the-t-in-rtf> Nuts, that one is backed by redis or mongodb.
2015-09-16T13:24:56 <the-t-in-rtf> I am happy with an in-memory cache.
2015-09-16T13:25:21 * simonjb joined the channel
2015-09-16T13:27:22 <the-t-in-rtf> Oh, this seems reasonable:  https://github.com/isaacs/node-lru-cache
2015-09-16T13:28:13 <the-t-in-rtf> It culls stale items when you ask for information from the cache rather than keeping a bunch of timeouts running.
2015-09-16T13:30:35 <colinclark> the-t-in-rtf: Interesting! How will you deploy your cache?
2015-09-16T13:30:54 <colinclark> It\'s an in-app cache for data in your database?
2015-09-16T13:31:37 <the-t-in-rtf> It would be part of a gpii.express.router and hold information that would otherwise need to be looked up in using a REST call.
2015-09-16T13:31:49 <colinclark> aha, very interesting
2015-09-16T13:32:35 <the-t-in-rtf> When we get into things like permission checking, we could end up with one call to get the user from Couch and another to get the group memberships.
2015-09-16T13:32:50 <colinclark> Right
2015-09-16T13:33:07 <colinclark> At least the LRU Cache module seems steadily maintained
2015-09-16T13:33:15 * yzen joined the channel
2015-09-16T13:33:22 <the-t-in-rtf> I was looking through this list:  https://nodejsmodules.org/tags/cache
2015-09-16T13:33:36 <colinclark> and in 300 lines, it\'s the kind of thing that you can fully understand before using it
2015-09-16T13:33:38 <the-t-in-rtf> Their certificate is expired, but they have a rationale based on how many other libraries use the package.
2015-09-16T13:34:05 <the-t-in-rtf> Yes, the documentation seems OK, and most of the config stuff is very friendly to being componentized.
2015-09-16T13:34:13 <the-t-in-rtf> I haven\'t seen anything weird with it yet.
2015-09-16T13:35:05 <colinclark> It has a good number of dependents
2015-09-16T13:35:37 <the-t-in-rtf> And it only has two dependencies itself, which is a nice change.
2015-09-16T13:36:33 <the-t-in-rtf> Nothing funny with the license.
2015-09-16T13:39:30 <Bosmon> Yes - the question is whether it is actually useful
2015-09-16T13:39:47 <Bosmon> And I have my doubts about this
2015-09-16T13:39:51 <colinclark> simonjb, Bosmon, the-t-in-rtf: I wonder if our work on the account system for the GPII dovetails in some way with Tony\'s task related to building a new user system for the Unified Listing?
2015-09-16T13:45:27 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - so, this thing being a CACHE, it involves some kind of engineering tradeoff between latency, throughput, and memory consumption on a particular machine in a particular configuration in a particular workload
2015-09-16T13:45:39 <Bosmon> And so our choice of it would seem to have to be motivated by some kinds of engineering measurements
2015-09-16T13:46:07 <Bosmon> The fact that we have none of these suggests that we should just proceed with a "minimum viable" system for now, and make a note that we have seen this library as a possible option when the time comes that we have some measurements or estimates
2015-09-16T13:46:18 <the-t-in-rtf> Yes, a TODO costs us very little.
2015-09-16T13:46:27 <the-t-in-rtf> I have to write the thing that gets the actual data first anyway\xe2\x80\xa6 ;)
2015-09-16T13:46:33 <Bosmon> cool :)
2015-09-16T13:46:53 <simonjb> colinclark, Bosmon, the-t-in-rtf: I think there would definitely be opportunity for working together/re-using code -- I believe Tony has been doing work on user management of accounts, such as emailing password reminders and such (which would be really good to use for the GPII account system)
2015-09-16T13:47:18 <the-t-in-rtf> Is there a link to the GPII account system work?
2015-09-16T13:47:32 <the-t-in-rtf> Just wondering if it\'s the OAuth stuff I saw previously.
2015-09-16T13:47:33 <simonjb> the-t-in-rtf: it\'s very minimal right now
2015-09-16T13:47:43 <simonjb> yes -- the OAuth stuff
2015-09-16T13:48:47 <simonjb> the-t-in-rtf: we are currently working on CouchDB implementation for storing authentication and user information
2015-09-16T13:48:57 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - you may be interested in the writeup from the meeting that simonjb, cindyli and Justin_o and I had on Monday: https://wiki.gpii.net/w/CouchDB_security_persistence_2015-09-14
2015-09-16T13:49:14 <Bosmon> It isn\'t directly related to your work, but it is both CouchDB and user-related so it isn\'t completely irrelevant
2015-09-16T13:50:11 <the-t-in-rtf> It\'s definitely interesting.
2015-09-16T13:50:29 <colinclark> I might not be thinking very clearly here... but should we just build one user/account system and share it?
2015-09-16T13:50:42 <Bosmon> I imagine we should, yes
2015-09-16T13:51:03 <Bosmon> Especially since express-couchuser is so manifestly shoddy
2015-09-16T13:51:06 <the-t-in-rtf> Unless we can have the central user management solution live in two weeks, we need something that stands alone for now.
2015-09-16T13:51:09 <simonjb> the-t-in-rtf: these are the designs that we have for log in and account creation: http://wiki.fluidproject.org/download/attachments/34570511/PMT-login-simplified.pdf?api=v2
2015-09-16T13:51:17 <Bosmon> poorly-maintained, bugridden, and all the rest that we expect
2015-09-16T13:51:24 <colinclark> the-t-in-rtf: Tell me two things...
2015-09-16T13:51:31 <colinclark> what\'s the "in two weeks" deadline?
2015-09-16T13:51:41 <colinclark> and what does "stands alone" mean
2015-09-16T13:51:42 <colinclark> ?
2015-09-16T13:51:57 <the-t-in-rtf> Basically no one can see the work we\'ve already finished on the manufacturer interface because express-couchUser stopped working and they can\'t log in.
2015-09-16T13:52:00 * jhung joined the channel
2015-09-16T13:52:07 <the-t-in-rtf> I need a replacement before the F2F.
2015-09-16T13:52:37 <the-t-in-rtf> Stand alone just means they have an account on the UL and another on the PTD instead of one across all our holdings.
2015-09-16T13:52:53 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - there is no "central user management solution" - there is just your work :)
2015-09-16T13:52:54 <the-t-in-rtf> If we use a single library then we can safely combine data sets later.
2015-09-16T13:53:03 <Bosmon> ONLY YOU CAN SAVE MANKIND
2015-09-16T13:53:22 <colinclark> the-t-in-rtf: The timeline for the security work is a tiny bit more less tight than yours, it sounds like
2015-09-16T13:53:24 <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. if we control the means by which passwords are stored and verified, then we can just sync the data with couch even.
2015-09-16T13:53:25 <Justin_o> jhung: would you prefer the topics sidebar to be open by default.
2015-09-16T13:53:27 <Justin_o> or closed
2015-09-16T13:53:31 <colinclark> so the questions, then, are:
2015-09-16T13:53:46 <colinclark> 1. How can we help you do the best you can for your timeline?
2015-09-16T13:53:57 <jhung> Justin_o: open by default.
2015-09-16T13:54:08 <colinclark> 2. How can we ensure that we can simply refactor and reuse your stuff for the GPII-wide acount system?
2015-09-16T13:54:10 <Justin_o> okay, thanks
2015-09-16T13:54:13 <the-t-in-rtf> 1. Feedback on the API docs and JIRA ticket, help with the CouchDB dataSource.
2015-09-16T13:54:30 <the-t-in-rtf> 2. There will be a pull request to review my work and we will (as usual) haul out anything of wider interest.
2015-09-16T13:54:45 <the-t-in-rtf> I am scoping a week (which is 3 working days) for this, so it should not be a lot of sunk cost.
2015-09-16T13:55:53 <the-t-in-rtf> by haul out I mean make available for easy reuse, as with gpii.express, gpii.handlebars, gpii.pouchdb, etc.
2015-09-16T13:56:30 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - sounds reasonable - although for one reason or another, 3 working days might not prove adequate
2015-09-16T13:56:46 <the-t-in-rtf> Well, it\'s three working days, but many more showers to think about things.
2015-09-16T13:57:27 <the-t-in-rtf> And those three working days are likely spread over a couple weeks with conversation in between.
2015-09-16T13:57:40 <the-t-in-rtf> As we\'ve done with our fleet of pull requests.
2015-09-16T13:58:38 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - you should bear in mind that I am not going to be very available over the next 2 weeks - but I\'m sure you can demo at the F2F from material in a branch and we can pick up the review later
2015-09-16T13:58:59 <the-t-in-rtf> Yes, that\'s the idea.  As long as the login works, I don\'t particularly care if I have to create all accounts myself and type the confirmation emails.
2015-09-16T13:59:18 <Bosmon> PAY NO ATTENTION TO THE MAN BEHIND THE CURTAIN :)
2015-09-16T13:59:21 <Bosmon> HE IS IRRELEVANT!
2015-09-16T13:59:29 <the-t-in-rtf> The good news is I already have exhaustive tests from the express-couchuser days, since we could not trust their code much at all.
2015-09-16T13:59:41 <the-t-in-rtf> This covers both the API itself and front-end components.
2015-09-16T13:59:41 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - that\'s very cool
2015-09-16T13:59:56 <Bosmon> As we frequently reflect, sometimes the only valuable outcome from an engineering effort is its test cases
2015-09-16T14:00:03 <Bosmon> Which it makes it all the more important to write any :)
2015-09-16T14:00:14 <the-t-in-rtf> @simonjb, the only difference is accepting the terms and conditions, which could easily be a grade extending the login widget I have already.
2015-09-16T14:00:37 <the-t-in-rtf> I have also desperately wanted feedback on the quality of my client-side code, working together on that would be awesome.
2015-09-16T14:00:55 <the-t-in-rtf> @simonjb, sorry, missed the context, I mean I just looked at the design PDF.
2015-09-16T14:01:40 <the-t-in-rtf> I\'m not at the next F2F, but at our next on-site, I would be very happy to have a tutorial session with the additional pieces of test infrastructure I\'ve written.
2015-09-16T14:02:12 <the-t-in-rtf> We can test so much that we simply couldn\'t before.
2015-09-16T14:02:36 <Bosmon> Yes, since we will be able to point your impl at pouch rather than couch
2015-09-16T14:02:46 <Bosmon> Is that what you meant?
