2015-02-09T15:26:32 <jhernandez> clown: hey!
2015-02-09T15:27:02 <jhernandez> just seen your comment
2015-02-09T15:27:06 <clown> jhernandez, thanks again for looking into the tricky three (?) way merge.
2015-02-09T15:27:18 <jhernandez> heh, no prob
2015-02-09T15:27:44 <clown> I have time to test the whole device reporter, if you like, based on your new branch.
2015-02-09T15:27:50 <clown> Or have you already done that?
2015-02-09T15:28:04 <clown> Or should I wait?
2015-02-09T15:28:44 <jhernandez> at least, give some time until I review the universal side of our changes
2015-02-09T15:29:20 <jhernandez> will merge the linux side in a minute and will switch to the universal one
2015-02-09T15:29:47 <jhernandez> right now, tests are passing here
2015-02-09T15:30:03 <clown> Okay.  I was wondering if there was a point to testing this without the universal side.
2015-02-09T15:30:21 <clown> Looks like there isn\'t just yet.
2015-02-09T15:30:29 <jhernandez> yup, will ping you back once I\'m done with universal
2015-02-09T15:30:37 <clown> re:  "tests are passing".  Woohoo!
2015-02-09T15:30:50 <jhernandez> xD
2015-02-09T15:31:10 <colinclark> hey Justin_o and anastasiac
2015-02-09T15:31:27 <clown> okay.  I have time today and some time tomorrow for GPII work, jhernandez.  Let me know when/how I can help.
2015-02-09T15:31:33 <anastasiac> good morning, colinclark
2015-02-09T15:31:39 <colinclark> I was just finishing up the handouts for the developer fair later this week
2015-02-09T15:31:51 <colinclark> and I noticed that there\'s a dead link in the README for Infusion
2015-02-09T15:31:54 <colinclark> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion
2015-02-09T15:32:01 <colinclark> Or rather
2015-02-09T15:32:01 <colinclark> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion#where-can-i-see-infusion-components
2015-02-09T15:32:24 <colinclark> The link in this section returns a 404: http://fluidproject.org/products/infusion/infusion-demos/
2015-02-09T15:33:14 <clown> slim_jim, if you have a moment, do you know what\'s up with this meeting:  http://doodle.com/qrurcyu7mf7yygae?
2015-02-09T15:33:20 <colinclark> Any chance we could update this to point to our demos?
2015-02-09T15:33:29 <colinclark> or to this page if it is comprehensive: http://fluidproject.org/infusion.html
2015-02-09T15:33:32 <colinclark> or whever you recommend?
2015-02-09T15:34:37 <slim_jim> clown: What do ou mean? Ithe meeting was held and notes circulated. Also a noew mailing list
2015-02-09T15:34:50 <Justin_o> colinclark, anastasiac do we want that to point at stable or nightly demos?
2015-02-09T15:35:02 <colinclark> You tell me
2015-02-09T15:35:04 <colinclark> I\'m not sure
2015-02-09T15:35:34 <colinclark> Presumably if it\'s "Where can I see Infusion Components?" it should be a link to something stable
2015-02-09T15:35:49 <colinclark> Thought I don\'t see any reason why we wouldn\'t want to link to both
2015-02-09T15:35:52 <Justin_o> I\'m not sure too.. i would say nightly for master, but stable for released
2015-02-09T15:36:03 <Justin_o> colinclark: that\'s true, that should be easy enough
2015-02-09T15:36:23 * michelled has quit
2015-02-09T15:37:15 <clown> slim_jim, I didn\'t see any of it.  Perhaps I was asleep at the switch.  Where is the new mailing list?
2015-02-09T15:37:49 <slim_jim> clown: I\'ll forward the emails .....
2015-02-09T15:37:59 <clown> thanks, slim_jim
2015-02-09T15:39:03 <jhernandez> clown: cool, thanks!

2015-02-09T15:43:03 <clown> yep, slim_jim, I have the two emails.  Thanks again.
2015-02-09T15:43:12 <slim_jim> clown: :0
2015-02-09T15:43:58 <Justin_o> colinclark, anastasiac: I filed a new jira http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5595
2015-02-09T15:45:08 <colinclark> Can I leave it with you guys to address before Wednesday, Justin_o?
2015-02-09T15:45:24 <anastasiac> Justin_o, colinclark: looking at that Infusion page, I realize there\xe2\x80\x99s no link there for UIO or the prefs framework. I wonder if we should add one?
2015-02-09T15:45:43 <anastasiac> and yes, colinclark, we\xe2\x80\x99ll make sure it gets done
2015-02-09T15:46:04 <colinclark> I think we should add UIO, definitely
2015-02-09T15:46:07 <colinclark> and thanks anastasiac, I appreciate it
2015-02-09T15:46:24 <colinclark> this is going to be good--I have a feeling Infusion is going to be very popular at this meeting
2015-02-09T15:46:58 <colinclark> Sepideh, anastasiac, michelled: I sent you guys an email with my edits to the Infusion and Floe handouts
2015-02-09T15:47:02 <colinclark> I\'m curious about your thoughts
2015-02-09T15:47:09 <anastasiac> will look, colinclark
2015-02-09T15:47:11 <colinclark> Hopefully I haven\'t made them too much worse :)
2015-02-09T15:47:17 <colinclark> I wanted to add a bit more technical detail to the Infusion one
2015-02-09T15:49:33 <Sepideh> sure, let me have a look
2015-02-09T15:49:46 <anastasiac> colinclark, yes, the Infusion should resonate well with a technical audience, I like the changes.
2015-02-09T15:51:07 <anastasiac> colinclark, on the Floe page, I think you\xe2\x80\x99re missing a dash in the first of the three headings
2015-02-09T15:52:13 <anastasiac> colinclark, in the opening sentence of the Guidelines & Tools section, either add a comma after \xe2\x80\x98best practices\xe2\x80\x99 or remove the comma after \xe2\x80\x98Handbook\xe2\x80\x99
2015-02-09T15:52:39 <anastasiac> well, that\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99d do :-)
2015-02-09T15:52:59 <colinclark> :)
2015-02-09T15:53:35 <colinclark> thanks anastasiac
2015-02-09T15:53:57 <colinclark> I\'ve added the missing dash and removed the comma
2015-02-09T15:54:09 <anastasiac> colinclark, other than my usual nitpicky comments, it looks great!
2015-02-09T15:55:10 <colinclark> cool
2015-02-09T15:55:25 <colinclark> I still feel like there\'s something slightly circular about the Floe project one
2015-02-09T15:55:34 <colinclark> but perhaps the project is slightly circular in that regard
2015-02-09T15:56:01 <Sepideh> colinclark, although I don\xe2\x80\x99t have much knowledge about the technical aspects of the Infusion, your text was very clear and I could understand all of it:)
2015-02-09T15:56:16 <Justin_o> cindyli:  i left you some comments on your FLOE-262 pull request
2015-02-09T15:56:36 <cindyli> thanks, Justin_o, will take a look soon
2015-02-09T15:58:44 <colinclark> thanks Sepideh!
2015-02-09T15:59:03 <colinclark> shall I go ahead and send this to matthias to be printed, anastasiac?
2015-02-09T15:59:27 <anastasiac> colinclark, it looks good to me.
2015-02-09T16:00:00 <colinclark> cool
2015-02-09T16:00:10 <colinclark> I\'ll ship it1
2015-02-09T16:00:12 <michelled> I really like these handouts. I wonder if there\'s a nice place to put them on our site
2015-02-09T16:00:15 <colinclark> Thanks again for all your help
2015-02-09T16:00:30 <anastasiac> Justin_o, I\xe2\x80\x99ve created a JIRA for updating the fluidproject.org website to add the uio demo: http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5596
2015-02-09T16:00:36 <colinclark> I wonder if perhaps we should make the i\x08Infusion page the same as the handout
2015-02-09T16:00:51 <michelled> this one, you mean? http://fluidproject.org/infusion.html
2015-02-09T16:00:58 <Justin_o> anastasiac: thanks
2015-02-09T16:01:19 <Justin_o> anastasiac: will you be making pull requests for FLUID-5596 and/or FLUID-5595
2015-02-09T16:01:30 <anastasiac> Justin_o, yes, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take care of that today
2015-02-09T16:01:38 <anastasiac> both
2015-02-09T16:02:45 <Justin_o> anastasiac: thanks
2015-02-09T16:02:54 <colinclark> Oh!
2015-02-09T16:03:01 <colinclark> I just thought of one thing
2015-02-09T16:03:09 <colinclark> Sepideh, could you do me a huge favour
2015-02-09T16:03:20 <Sepideh> for sure
2015-02-09T16:03:23 <colinclark> Can you lay these handouts out on A4-sized paper?
2015-02-09T16:03:38 <colinclark> That\'s the standard paper size here
2015-02-09T16:03:43 <colinclark> I\'ll send you the latest version
2015-02-09T16:04:43 <Sepideh> great, I\xe2\x80\x99ll send them to you asap

2015-02-09T16:06:17 <anastasiac_> colinclark, were you suggesting updating http://fluidproject.org/infusion.html to look like the handout, and then pointing the Infusion README to a different page for demos?

2015-02-09T16:20:29 <colinclark> If we felt like we had the time and desire, we certainly could
2015-02-09T16:20:48 <colinclark> but what I was suggesting for Wednesday is to make sure there is a working, prominent link our README to our demos
2015-02-09T16:21:08 <colinclark> and the current Infusion page (http://fluidproject.org/infusion.html) seems really close to what we want
2015-02-09T16:21:23 <colinclark> except that, as you mentioned, we\'re missing some demos listed there
