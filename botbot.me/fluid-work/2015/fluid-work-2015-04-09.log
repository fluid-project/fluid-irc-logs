2015-04-09T12:36:02 * anastasiac has left the channel
2015-04-09T12:42:09 <michelled> np! I just wanted to let you know that anastasiac, colinclark and I met yesterday to talk about what we would do for the workshop
2015-04-09T12:42:18 <michelled> Justin_o: what are you working on right now?
2015-04-09T12:42:45 <Justin_o> michelled: working on integrating the congratulations screen with the first discovery tool
2015-04-09T12:42:52 <Justin_o> basically getting the unit tests all passing again
2015-04-09T12:42:58 <michelled> cool
2015-04-09T12:43:17 <michelled> once that's done, I think it's time to move onto the new designs that danayotte had shown us
2015-04-09T12:43:18 <Justin_o> michelled: any changes with the plans?
2015-04-09T12:43:26 <Justin_o> michelled: okay,
2015-04-09T12:43:26 <michelled> we are going to start with the sticky keys
2015-04-09T12:43:30 <Justin_o> okay
2015-04-09T12:43:43 <michelled> I've updated the iteration plan page to show the new priorities
2015-04-09T12:44:05 <michelled> Justin_o: also, simon is going to be helping us with this work
2015-04-09T12:44:17 <michelled> I'm thinking it makes sense for either you or cindy to pair up with him for a couple days
2015-04-09T12:44:26 <michelled> so we can get him ramped up as quickly as possible
2015-04-09T12:44:36 <michelled> Justin_o: I'm not certain how best to split up the work
2015-04-09T12:44:51 <Justin_o> michelled: cool.. maybe cindy would be better for pairing because i'm working from home today
2015-04-09T12:45:03 <Justin_o> michelled: yes, i was just going to ask about how the work should be split
2015-04-09T12:45:38 <michelled> based on the estimates, it looks like we can only get the sticky keys and language done
2015-04-09T12:45:57 <michelled> but if we are done those, we should focus on integrating with GPII prefs server
2015-04-09T12:46:59 <michelled> also, Justin_o, simon is transitioning from the security work, so he might actually start on this tomorrow
2015-04-09T12:48:49 <Justin_o> michelled: okay.. makes sense

2015-04-09T13:40:36 <cindyli> Justin_o: if the congratulation is a panel component, i think it should be in panels.js
2015-04-09T13:40:49 <Justin_o> cindyli: okay.. i'll move it into panels.js

2015-04-09T15:20:58 <jhung> hi simonjb.
2015-04-09T15:21:10 <Justin_o> michelled, cindyli, anastasiac: so it turns out that you can't close a window in a browser that wasn't opened by a script. It gives an error.
2015-04-09T15:21:34 <anastasiac> interesting
2015-04-09T15:21:40 <simonjb> hey jhung
2015-04-09T15:21:58 <Justin_o> my original test had worked, because it lets you close a new tab that you open. but when my browser was restored after quitting.. the existing tabs couldn't be closed.
2015-04-09T15:22:17 <anastasiac> Justin_o, thoughts on how to deal with this?
2015-04-09T15:22:20 <Justin_o> anastasiac, michelled, cindyli: so i'm thinking we should remove the close button from the congratulations page
2015-04-09T15:22:42 <Justin_o> i don't really think there is a way around it, unless we use a script to create the window to begin with, but that seems strange
2015-04-09T15:22:59 <jhung> I have updated my FLUID-5609 branch with the new ToC for the infusion docs. But I was hoping you can help me improve my inefficient handlebars helper simonjb.
2015-04-09T15:23:02 <Justin_o> or maybe use an external app to close it

2015-04-09T15:56:45 <Justin_o> michelled, anastasiac, cindyli: any thoughts on whether or not i should remove the close button from the congratulations page
2015-04-09T15:56:56 <Justin_o> i could also leave it in for now and let dana decide next week
2015-04-09T15:57:59 <anastasiac> Justin_o, we should probably check with dana next week regardless, but it sounds like we don\xe2\x80\x99t have much choice. The only reliable choice would be for the tool to create its own window on start-up, right? Which is a bit odd, as you say.

2015-04-09T15:58:18 <Justin_o> here's the info on window.close

2015-04-09T15:59:13 <anastasiac> I\xe2\x80\x99d say take it out for now - that\xe2\x80\x99s probably the simplest and quickest thing.
