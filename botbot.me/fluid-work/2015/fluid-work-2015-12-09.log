2015-12-09T17:59:17 <Bosmon> Justin_o - environment variables are not dynamic quantities
2015-12-09T17:59:28 <Bosmon> There is no expectation that they change over the lifetime of a process, unless that process is an interactive shell
2015-12-09T17:59:37 <Bosmon> Capturing at the point of execution is perfectly fine and correct

2015-12-09T19:20:15 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks, it\'s a bit of an issue for the test i was trying to write, but i think i\'ll just make sure the process.env and the my component\'s env member are equivalent
2015-12-09T19:20:45 <Bosmon> Hi Justin_o - what is the issue?
2015-12-09T19:20:47 * alanharnum joined the channel
2015-12-09T19:21:57 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i was going to add an environment variable in the test and then check if it is attached to the component. However, the process.env has already been evaluated before the test file is loaded
2015-12-09T19:22:21 <Justin_o> well at least before my test environment variable is added
2015-12-09T19:23:46 <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: today\'s community meeting will be a continuation of the Inclusive Statistics talk

2015-12-09T15:33:06 <kasparnet> hi michelled - I wont be at tonights architecture meeting - would you be able to open the room, etc?
2015-12-09T15:33:43 <michelled> sure, kasparnet. do you have any items that should be discussed?
2015-12-09T15:34:19 <kasparnet> no, afaik it\'s just updates
2015-12-09T15:38:22 <clown> jhernandez, I guess I should close this pull, since yours covers it all anyhow:  https://github.com/amb26/linux/pull/3

2015-12-09T15:56:46 <clown> jhernandez, sorry, I didn\'t quite do the merge from your branch correctly last time, and am working on that now.  "One moment please".
2015-12-09T15:57:51 <jhernandez> ok ok

2015-12-09T16:01:35 <Justin_o> anastasiac: i\'ll take another look
2015-12-09T16:03:03 <anastasiac> michelled: I\xe2\x80\x99ve issued a pull request for the documentation licensing issue: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/pull/78 Justin_o asked a good question...
2015-12-09T16:08:01 <michelled> anastasiac: I think we really wanted to be clear about our code licenseing
2015-12-09T16:08:25 <michelled> assuming many people are like us and the first thing they want to know is whether or not they can use the framework/toolkit

2015-12-09T16:12:26 <colinclark> michelled, Justin_o, anastasiac: I think it\'s reasonable to have what we have, "This documentation is licensed under..." and add another sentence to the effect of "All code examples are licensed under..."
2015-12-09T16:12:46 <anastasiac> I\xe2\x80\x99m just adding that right now...
2015-12-09T16:12:51 <colinclark> awesome
2015-12-09T16:13:55 <clown> jhernandez:  pushed to my github GPII-1526 branch, but it looks like just some white space.  You better double check though.  (I don\'t have enough caffeine in me yet).
2015-12-09T16:13:58 <clown> As far as test failures, I\'m seeing a failure from "UnitTests.sh" with respect to the orcaSettingsHandlerTests.js.

2015-12-09T16:21:29 <clown> jhernandez:  I\'m looking into it.
2015-12-09T16:21:39 <clown> unless you\'ve already solved it...

2015-12-09T17:35:02 <Justin_o> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/kfgJVHF4/
2015-12-09T17:35:06 <Justin_o> so that\'s what I have
2015-12-09T17:35:11 <Justin_o> which we talked about before
2015-12-09T17:35:55 <Justin_o> however, i guess this just captures process.env at the time that the fluid.defaults is called
2015-12-09T17:36:08 <Justin_o> so any new environment variables will not be accessible
2015-12-09T17:36:26 <Justin_o> any thoughts on that
2015-12-09T17:40:10 <jhernandez> clown: sorry, missed your last comment
2015-12-09T17:40:33 <clown> no problem.  I am seeing a lot of warnings about gsettings schemas.
2015-12-09T17:40:50 <jhernandez> ok, then the problem with UnitTests.sh is just in my local machine
2015-12-09T17:41:14 <clown> e.g. "warning: Schema \'org.freedesktop.IBus.Chewing\' has path \'/desktop/ibus/engine/chewing/\'.  Paths starting with \'/apps/\', \'/desktop/\' or \'/system/\' are deprecated."
2015-12-09T17:41:52 * clown wonders why anyone would chew on an iBus.
2015-12-09T17:43:14 <clown> jhernandez:  I am running on my GPII-1526 branch.  Perhaps I should try yours, although git says they are identical

2015-12-09T17:50:04 <jhernandez> clown: yeah, I\'m experiencing problems in packageKit\'s, but only when they run after gsettings\' ones
2015-12-09T17:50:16 * lliskovoi has quit
2015-12-09T17:50:40 <clown> weird.
2015-12-09T17:50:46 <jhernandez> probably is due to the fact that gsettings\' tests make use of \'sudo\' to perform some operations
2015-12-09T17:50:54 * lliskovoi joined the channel
2015-12-09T17:51:41 <clown> is packageKit complaining about being "root"?
2015-12-09T17:53:10 <jhernandez> nope, it throws a few errors and then segfaults
2015-12-09T17:53:12 <jhernandez> :)
2015-12-09T17:53:18 * ATW joined the channel
2015-12-09T17:54:50 <clown> perhaps packageKit has had too much caffeine.
2015-12-09T17:55:02 <jhernandez> hahaha
2015-12-09T17:55:10 <jhernandez> indeeed
2015-12-09T17:55:11 <jhernandez> xDDDD
2015-12-09T17:56:18 <jhernandez> so, although you\'re not having such problem in F22, do you thing it\'s worth to switch the execution order in unitTests?
2015-12-09T17:56:29 <jhernandez> s/thing/think
2015-12-09T17:56:35 <jhernandez> clown: ^
2015-12-09T17:56:37 <clown> if that fixes it, I guess.
2015-12-09T17:56:45 <clown> it\'s very weird.
2015-12-09T17:57:14 <jhernandez> it is
2015-12-09T17:57:30 <clown> would running the gesttings tests in a new shell help?
2015-12-09T17:57:38 <clown> to isolate the sudo calls?
2015-12-09T17:57:56 <jhernandez> probably

2015-12-09T14:16:37 <Justin_o> Bosmon: kettle config question if you have time
2015-12-09T14:16:58 <Bosmon> Hi there Justin_o
2015-12-09T14:17:45 <Justin_o> Bosmon: so for the time being i\'ll have to keep using something like an index.js file to load the configs, due to a limitation in the vagrant/ansible work for auto launching the app
2015-12-09T14:17:48 <Justin_o> so i\'m trying this
2015-12-09T14:17:56 <Justin_o> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/mOgwFUFM/
2015-12-09T14:18:22 <Justin_o> but was getting errors last night that basically kettle.load was undefined
2015-12-09T14:18:26 <Justin_o> anything i\'m missing there
2015-12-09T14:18:33 <Justin_o> i\'m going to try again this morning, just rebuilding my VM
2015-12-09T14:18:41 <Bosmon> Justin_o - a typo, yes
2015-12-09T14:19:06 <Bosmon> I\'m sure you are more alert this morning :)
2015-12-09T14:19:43 <Bosmon> Here\'s the docs: https://github.com/amb26/kettle/blob/KETTLE-32/README.md#starting-a-kettle-config-programmatically
2015-12-09T14:20:42 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i was supposed to use this kettle.config.loadConfig
2015-12-09T14:20:43 <Justin_o> :(
2015-12-09T14:21:20 * anastasiac joined the channel
2015-12-09T14:21:29 * alanharnum joined the channel
2015-12-09T14:21:52 <Bosmon> no worries :)
2015-12-09T14:22:36 <Justin_o> this is why i prefer to work in the morning :)
2015-12-09T14:22:55 <Bosmon> For me it\'s the other way round
2015-12-09T14:22:59 <Bosmon> I can barely see in the mornings : P
2015-12-09T14:24:40 <Justin_o> Bosmon: funny how that works eh.. good thing we\'re five hours apart
2015-12-09T14:30:49 <Justin_o> Bosmon: another question, getting the error
2015-12-09T14:30:54 <Justin_o> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/Y53ARAsi/
2015-12-09T14:32:15 <Justin_o> oh i think i\'m still using things wrong :(
2015-12-09T14:33:02 <Bosmon> It also looks like you\'re bound to some quite old version of Infusion
2015-12-09T14:34:48 <Justin_o> Bosmon: it\'s my mistake i was supposed to pass in an object to kettle.config.loadConfig but was passing things in as arguments. I\'ve gotten past that now onto new errors :)
2015-12-09T14:35:27 <Bosmon> This is what the "current" module.js looks like: https://github.com/amb26/infusion/blob/18ee3f8e49212d902ad96ecbd37f985c0aeee380/src/module/module.js
2015-12-09T14:36:14 <Justin_o> Bosmon:  i probably am on an older version of Infusion, at one point i had to pull in a copy from one of your branches because it had changes that kettle needed. Do you know if i can use infusion master yet?
2015-12-09T14:36:22 * colinclark joined the channel
2015-12-09T14:36:30 <Bosmon> Justin_o - no, not infusion master
2015-12-09T14:36:43 <Bosmon> But you should use the version of infusion which is referred to from Kettle\'s package.json
2015-12-09T14:36:56 <Justin_o> okay
2015-12-09T14:37:06 <Bosmon> Which is the version at the tip of this pull request
2015-12-09T14:37:19 <Justin_o> Bosmon: this one 2.0.0-dev.20151130T180545Z.18ee3f8
2015-12-09T14:37:53 <Bosmon> Justin_o - that one, yes
2015-12-09T14:38:03 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks, i\'ll switch to that
2015-12-09T14:38:22 <Bosmon> In general my FLUID-5818 branch has become our "shadow trunk"
2015-12-09T14:38:23 <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/654
2015-12-09T14:38:29 <Bosmon> At the end of this pull request
2015-12-09T14:38:59 <Justin_o> Bosmon: any ETA for when that will be merged to master?
2015-12-09T14:39:07 <Bosmon> Justin_o - you know who to ask :)
2015-12-09T14:39:16 <Justin_o> colinclark: ^
2015-12-09T14:39:17 <Justin_o> :)
2015-12-09T14:39:32 <colinclark> erm
2015-12-09T14:39:42 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2015-12-09T14:39:44 <colinclark> well, I think it can be soon
2015-12-09T14:40:04 <colinclark> I don\'t see any reason why I can\'t work on it today, Justin_o
2015-12-09T14:40:13 <Justin_o> colinclark: excellent, thanks :)
2015-12-09T14:40:16 <colinclark> I\'m sorry it\'s taken so long
2015-12-09T14:40:30 <Bosmon> No hurry, colinclark -
2015-12-09T14:40:37 <Bosmon> I think I\'ll try to issue a fix for FLUID-5824 today
2015-12-09T14:40:37 <colinclark> well, it should get done
2015-12-09T14:40:42 <colinclark> ok
2015-12-09T14:40:59 <Justin_o> colinclark: no worries, it would be ideal to have all FD server dependencies pointing at code in a master branch, but it\'ll be workable either way
2015-12-09T14:41:21 <Justin_o> i\'m guessing Kettle-32 isn\'t ready yet either
2015-12-09T14:41:27 <Justin_o> to go into kettle\'s master
2015-12-09T14:41:54 <colinclark> Justin_o: I completely agree

2015-12-09T14:52:39 <Justin_o> Bosmon: did anything change with createOnEvent?

2015-12-09T15:00:21 <Bosmon> kasparnet, Justin_o - self-auto-deduping is working fine in my universal branch btw : P
2015-12-09T15:00:29 <Bosmon> So it seems that this dismal chapter is finally at an end
2015-12-09T15:00:34 <Justin_o> Bosmon: that\'s great
2015-12-09T15:01:01 <Bosmon> If you\'re working from my Infusion tip via Kettle you\'ll get it too
2015-12-09T15:01:16 <Bosmon> So you should be able to remove the dedupe steps from any projects that are that up-to-date
2015-12-09T15:01:40 <Bosmon> I just pushed 1.1.4 of node-jqunit which is bound to that version which was the last piece of the puzzle
2015-12-09T15:02:02 <Justin_o> Bosmon: so i should update node-jqunit too
2015-12-09T15:02:29 <Justin_o> Bosmon: what if about my gpii-express dependency, does that matter?
2015-12-09T15:02:52 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I guess that\'s a bit more problematic - I don\'t know how recent the-t-in-rtf is
2015-12-09T15:03:37 <Bosmon> There\'s certainly at least 2 routes to infusion via gpii-express
2015-12-09T15:03:42 <Bosmon> A direct one and the one via its Kettle

2015-12-09T15:16:25 <colinclark> Justin_o: Can you elaborate on your comment in our PGA questions wiki page?  "This would seem to require a change to the OAuth2 authorization server."
2015-12-09T15:16:45 <Justin_o> colinclark: would you like me to do that here or on the wiki?
2015-12-09T15:16:51 <colinclark> here is fine
2015-12-09T15:16:54 <colinclark> I\'m just curious
2015-12-09T15:17:35 <Justin_o> colinclark: okay, as far as I know the Client Credentials Grant that is implemented ( https://wiki.gpii.net/w/GPII_OAuth_2_Guide#Client_Credentials_Grant ) only allows for creation or a preference set
2015-12-09T15:17:42 <Justin_o> there is no access to modifying preferences
2015-12-09T15:17:54 <colinclark> I see
2015-12-09T15:18:10 <Justin_o> and the other forms of access require user login
2015-12-09T15:19:24 <clown> hi jhernandez.
2015-12-09T15:21:01 <colinclark> thanks, Justin_o
2015-12-09T15:21:49 <anastasiac> colinclark, Justin_o: I\xe2\x80\x99m planning to add these tech questions to the requirements google doc that Michelle created, so that we can discuss them at today\xe2\x80\x99s requirements meeting (at 1pm), but the various evaluation questions don\xe2\x80\x99t seem as relevant to this meeting. What is the plan for those questions? Will we be emailing them to the list, or would you like me to bring them up at the meeting anyways?
2015-12-09T15:21:56 <Justin_o> colinclark: np, cindyli could probably provide some more insight too
2015-12-09T15:22:26 * kasparnet has quit
2015-12-09T15:22:31 <colinclark> anastasiac: I was going to chat with danayo about it, but I think we\'ll email those questions
2015-12-09T15:23:55 <colinclark> anastasiac: I\'m going to rework 1ai a bit before you ship it
2015-12-09T15:24:05 <anastasiac> ok
2015-12-09T15:24:27 <anastasiac> seems I don\xe2\x80\x99t actually have permission to edit \xe2\x80\x93 or even comment on \xe2\x80\x93 that document, anyway :-)
2015-12-09T15:24:39 <anastasiac> so I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to just ask during the meeting

2015-12-09T15:26:18 <danayo> I was wondering same anastasiac colinclark - wanted to be sure to respond to ISKME emails -  emailing our questions sounds good to me
2015-12-09T15:26:21 <clown> jhernandez, you are fast\xe2\x80\xa6
2015-12-09T15:27:13 <colinclark> danayo: If you\'ve got a few minutes, let\'s go through our site selection/evaluation questions and comments soon
2015-12-09T15:27:25 <colinclark> and then you can send them as feedback to Michelle B.\'s email
2015-12-09T15:27:39 <jhernandez> clown: heh, saw your new pr after pushing it
2015-12-09T15:27:41 <danayo> sure colinclark, I\'m available any time
2015-12-09T15:27:55 <colinclark> ok great
