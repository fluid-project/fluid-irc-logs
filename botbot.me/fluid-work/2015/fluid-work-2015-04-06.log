2015-04-06T16:36:20 <cindyli> hi Bosmon
2015-04-06T16:40:15 <Bosmon> Hi there cindyli
2015-04-06T16:40:23 <Bosmon> Can I help you with your renderer problem?
2015-04-06T16:40:47 <cindyli> certainly, Bosmon
2015-04-06T16:41:27 <cindyli> let me paste a link of what I wanna do
2015-04-06T16:42:06 <cindyli> can you see this, Bosmon - https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/19818701/First%20Discovery%20Language%20March30.pdf
2015-04-06T16:42:28 <cindyli> this is the language panel for the first discovery tool.
2015-04-06T16:42:48 <cindyli> basically, there are a bunch of language buttons for users to select from
2015-04-06T16:43:34 <cindyli> regardless how many buttons, there should be three of them to be seen, arrows keys can be used to navigate thru these buttons
2015-04-06T16:44:37 <cindyli> to maintain the position of these three buttons, i'm using animate() to move the current selected button into the desired position if it was out of the view
2015-04-06T16:45:46 <cindyli> animate() works fine if these buttons are from straight html, but stops working once I use renderer to render out these buttons
2015-04-06T16:46:05 <cindyli> btw, these buttons are actually radio buttons but styled to have button look
2015-04-06T16:46:29 <cindyli> do you have any idea why rendered-out radio buttons are not scrollable?
2015-04-06T16:46:37 <Bosmon> cindyli - no idea, no!
2015-04-06T16:46:46 <cindyli> oh, noooooo

2015-04-06T18:40:37 <danaayotte> hi jhung, i was wondering if at some point you could walk me through what you're doing with infusion docs. maybe you could copy me on your email thread with anastasia if you think that would be a good place to start?
