2015-10-13T18:17:54 <sepidehshahi> Hi danayo: have you been able to download the LFS?
2015-10-13T18:24:25 <danayo> well, i\'ve downloaded it sepidehshahi, but not clear on next steps.
2015-10-13T18:25:30 <sepidehshahi> good, I tried downloading it but it seems that iyt is not installed on my system. and I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard back anything from them about access permissions\xe2\x80\xa6
2015-10-13T18:25:45 <Justin_o> danayo, sepidehshahi: I think jhung has it working on his machine
2015-10-13T18:26:10 * gtirloni joined the channel
2015-10-13T18:26:17 <sepidehshahi> Justin_o: yes, I was gonna ask him today:)
2015-10-13T18:27:05 <danayo> I haven\'t heard back either sepidehshahi. perhaps jhung can lead us through the process?

2015-10-13T19:11:47 <Bosmon> Hi there Justin_o
2015-10-13T19:11:59 <Justin_o> Bosmon: hello, so my FLOE-423 branch is ready for more review
2015-10-13T19:12:15 <Justin_o> i\'m also wondering if i should switch to the new dedupe script and if so, how to use it
2015-10-13T19:13:19 <Justin_o> Bosmon: ^
2015-10-13T19:13:57 <Bosmon> Justin_o - currently our plan for how to use it looks like this: https://github.com/GPII/universal/commit/cb96e3c29d910452234ba126afbae31901a9e86d#diff-b9cfc7f2cdf78a7f4b91a753d10865a2R53
2015-10-13T19:14:48 <Justin_o> Bosmon: is "start" an event or do you call "npm run start"
2015-10-13T19:15:28 <Bosmon> https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts
2015-10-13T19:16:16 <Bosmon> As far as I can see, it is an event
2015-10-13T19:16:34 <Bosmon> It\'s less than ideal running the dedupe on every start, but I guess it\'s better than many alternatives
2015-10-13T19:16:43 <Bosmon> I\'d be interested if you could think of another approach
2015-10-13T19:19:19 <Justin_o> Bosmon: https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/start
2015-10-13T19:19:31 <Justin_o> that makes it look like a command instead of an event
2015-10-13T19:19:49 <Bosmon> Well, whatever it is called, it seems to be a builtin
2015-10-13T19:19:55 <Justin_o> you\'d need to run "npm start" to have it work
2015-10-13T19:20:01 <Bosmon> Justin_o - that\'s correct, yes
2015-10-13T19:20:09 <Bosmon> You need to run npm start
2015-10-13T19:20:18 <Justin_o> Bosmon: so you\'d run "npm install" followed by "npm start" to launch your app
2015-10-13T19:20:20 <Bosmon> Rather than npm run start
2015-10-13T19:20:25 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes
2015-10-13T19:20:49 <Bosmon> I guess we could do it the other way round
2015-10-13T19:21:04 <Bosmon> And have a custom script called something like "fullinstall" that runs npm install && npm run dedupe-infusion
2015-10-13T19:21:22 <Bosmon> The untrained user really doesn\'t care what the install operation is called after all
2015-10-13T19:23:21 <Justin_o> Bosmon: true, in that case you might need to use "run" though
2015-10-13T19:23:28 <Bosmon> Yes
2015-10-13T19:23:30 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2015-10-13T19:23:32 <Bosmon> That one would need run
2015-10-13T19:23:37 <Bosmon> Well, see what you think : P
2015-10-13T19:23:41 <Bosmon> These are the raw materials available
2015-10-13T19:24:15 <Justin_o> Bosmon: cool thanks... would you like me to try it in FLUID-423 or wait till after that goes in?
2015-10-13T19:24:25 <Justin_o> also i\'m assuming i use npm to pull in the script
2015-10-13T19:24:49 <Bosmon> The script is referenced from package.json yes
2015-10-13T19:25:05 <Bosmon> Justin_o - you could add it to your pull, I may as well test that too

2015-10-13T10:59:23 <Bosmon> kasparnet: KASPARDNITT!
2015-10-13T11:01:50 <kasparnet> hello there Bosmon
2015-10-13T11:02:24 <kasparnet> So I (perhaps prematurely) merged and created an npm package of the grunt-gpii repo
2015-10-13T11:02:36 <kasparnet> but am running into some issues when testing it
2015-10-13T11:02:40 <Bosmon> "I see"
2015-10-13T11:02:56 <kasparnet> ... and I think it might have to do with it running "npm install" instead of "npm install --ignore-scripts"
2015-10-13T11:03:41 <kasparnet> I\'m getting things along the lines of:
2015-10-13T11:03:46 <kasparnet> Building the projects in this solution one at a time. To enable parallel build, please add the "/m" switch.
2015-10-13T11:03:46 <kasparnet> MSBUILD : error MSB3428: Could not load the Visual C++ component "VCBuild.exe". To fix this, 1) install the .NET Framework 2.0 SDK, 2) install Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 or 3) add the location of the component to the system path if it is installed elsewhere.  [C:\\Users\\kasper\\dev\\gpii\\windows\
ode_modules\\ffi\\build\\binding.sln]
2015-10-13T11:03:57 <kasparnet> and I can reprouce that by manually running "npm install"
2015-10-13T11:04:13 <kasparnet> whereas running "npm install --ignore-scripts" I dont get the error message
2015-10-13T11:05:52 <Bosmon> But it\'s not the job of the grunt scripts to install the windows repo
2015-10-13T11:06:46 <Bosmon> When it runs npm install, it runs it in universal, where it should do
2015-10-13T11:07:28 <Bosmon> It\'s YOU who has to run npm install --ignore-scripts, as the README says
2015-10-13T11:07:48 <kasparnet> that might be where it\'s failing
2015-10-13T11:07:52 <kasparnet> $ grunt build
2015-10-13T11:07:52 <kasparnet> Running "build" task
2015-10-13T11:07:52 <kasparnet> Running "gpii-universal" task

2015-10-13T11:08:36 <kasparnet> Bosmon: ok - ignore that last part
2015-10-13T11:08:44 <kasparnet> and let me think before I write stuff :)
2015-10-13T11:08:57 <Bosmon> Well to me that funny line is evidence that the pushd command is working correctly
2015-10-13T11:09:02 <Bosmon> But I\'m just going to double-check
2015-10-13T11:10:16 <Bosmon> Looks good to me:
2015-10-13T11:10:17 <Bosmon> pushing cwd of  ../node_modules/universal
2015-10-13T11:10:17 <Bosmon> E:\\source\\gits\\hens\

2015-10-13T11:10:17 <Bosmon> Got cwd of E:\\source\\gits\\hens\

2015-10-13T11:10:17 <Bosmon> >> grunt-gpii executing command npm install
2015-10-13T11:11:08 <Bosmon> And it\'s clearly the right npm install, I know what the wrong one looks like, it goes bananas about building all kinds of node-ffi stuff
2015-10-13T11:11:54 <Bosmon> kasparnet
2015-10-13T11:11:56 <Bosmon> wakey!
2015-10-13T11:12:02 <Bosmon> WHEN do you get the MSBUILD error exactly?
2015-10-13T11:12:08 <kasparnet> Bosmon: sec, let me paste stuff
2015-10-13T11:12:54 <kasparnet> http://pastie.org/10478460
2015-10-13T11:12:58 <Bosmon> And I was having such a lovely dream about the SINE RULE....
2015-10-13T11:13:17 <kasparnet> Bosmon: starting around line 14
2015-10-13T11:13:40 <Bosmon> kasparnet - that\'s a completely different problem
2015-10-13T11:13:57 <kasparnet> ugh - the formatting is completely screwed up
2015-10-13T11:14:05 <Bosmon> That\'s fine, I can see it
2015-10-13T11:14:15 <kasparnet> there is some more to the right
2015-10-13T11:14:33 <Bosmon> But it\'s not printing anything about binding.sln at all
2015-10-13T11:14:40 <Bosmon> Where did you get that bit from?
2015-10-13T11:14:51 <kasparnet> it is -- just scroll very far to the right :S
2015-10-13T11:15:24 <Bosmon> kasparnet - it doesn\'t
2015-10-13T11:15:28 <Bosmon> Not the one you pasted earlier
2015-10-13T11:15:41 <Bosmon> YOu pasted a link about windows\
ode_modules\\ffi\\build\\binding.sln
2015-10-13T11:16:03 <Bosmon> Whereas this one is complaining about the one in socket.io
2015-10-13T11:16:24 <kasparnet> oh yeah - didn\'t notice that before
2015-10-13T11:16:28 <Bosmon> gah
2015-10-13T11:16:33 <kasparnet> this one is indeed related to socket.io
2015-10-13T11:16:33 <Bosmon> I\'M meant to be the one that\'s asleep : P
2015-10-13T11:16:37 <kasparnet> haha
2015-10-13T11:16:52 <kasparnet> yeah sorry
2015-10-13T11:16:53 <Bosmon> As far as I can tell the build script has done exactly what it should
2015-10-13T11:17:12 <kasparnet> ok - perhaps I should try out the steps manually
2015-10-13T11:17:23 <Bosmon> Where did you get your message about ffi\\build\\binding.sln from?
2015-10-13T11:17:42 <Bosmon> What would you learn from trying out the steps manually if the build is working! : P
2015-10-13T11:17:43 <kasparnet> that was just from running \'npm install\' from windows
2015-10-13T11:17:49 <Bosmon> Yes but you never do that
2015-10-13T11:17:53 <Bosmon> THe README tells you not to!
2015-10-13T11:18:22 <Bosmon> "never do this"
2015-10-13T11:18:24 <Bosmon> It says
2015-10-13T11:18:28 <kasparnet> hahaha
2015-10-13T11:19:47 <kasparnet> perhaps when slim_ has some time to try it out, he can confirm whether it\'s working or broke
2015-10-13T11:20:12 <slim_> ok ;)
2015-10-13T11:20:34 <kasparnet> I gotta prep for the integration meeting now - but will look more at this afterwards
2015-10-13T11:21:10 <slim_> kasparnet: wow that time allready!? - Will grab lunch and then join you
