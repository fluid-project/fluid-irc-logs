2015-05-14T19:53:44 <Bosmon> Yes, they have, and found it mostly painless, apart from discovering a couple of small bugs along the way
2015-05-14T19:54:02 <Bosmon> Although it\'s hard to know whether the mission of accumulating ten billion pounds could be described as a "service" : P

b'2015-05-14T16:15:19 <colinclark> and that is configurable
2015-05-14T16:15:25 <Bosmon> I suspect we\'d have to struggle with "code climate" coding style conventions much more fiercely
2015-05-14T16:15:31 <colinclark> in the way that JSHint is
2015-05-14T16:15:34 * clown has quit
2015-05-14T16:15:37 <Bosmon> Especially if it adds noise through complaining about stuff like fluid.defaults
2015-05-14T16:16:03 <Justin_o> that is particularly unfortunate, and i don\'t see a clear way around it unless we were able to provide some flag
2015-05-14T16:16:18 <Justin_o> but even then you might want to know if you actually have duplicate grade definitions
2015-05-14T16:16:29 <Bosmon> I bet it couldn\'t detect such a thing :)
2015-05-14T16:16:44 <Justin_o> probably not, we might have to make our own one day :(
2015-05-14T16:16:48 <Bosmon> I bet MONEY that it is not designed to uncover duplication in JSON structures : P
2015-05-14T16:17:08 <Justin_o> how much money, i\'m willing to check :)
2015-05-14T16:17:20 <Bosmon> \xc2\xa35
2015-05-14T16:17:59 <Justin_o> that actually might be a lot here
2015-05-14T16:18:15 <Bosmon> Justin_o - the code climate code itself isn\'t actually open source, is it?
2015-05-14T16:18:33 <Justin_o> Bosmon: that\'s almost $10 here.. pretty sad for us
2015-05-14T16:18:46 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i don\'t know, but i\'d doubt it.. but it should be easy to test externally
2015-05-14T16:19:28 <Bosmon> If they aren\'t themselves an open source project, that seems a pretty clinching argument to me
2015-05-14T16:19:40 <Bosmon> What if their service went down, or their company ceased to exist?
2015-05-14T16:19:47 <colinclark> it was possible to fork JSLint when we needed to
2015-05-14T16:19:49 <colinclark> not so much with this
2015-05-14T16:20:01 <Justin_o> Bosmon: take a look at the duplications it found for us https://codeclimate.com/github/fluid-project/infusion/issues/categories/duplication
2015-05-14T16:20:32 <Justin_o> some of them are from the JSON structures, actually this one may be something that we could actually fix too
2015-05-14T16:21:08 <Justin_o> :( there\'s no easy way to link to the exact issue
2015-05-14T16:21:19 <colinclark> The ones in the OverviewPanel tests, for example
2015-05-14T16:21:41 <Bosmon> There are a few snippets in test cases
2015-05-14T16:22:00 <Justin_o> here are some more from the tests https://codeclimate.com/github/fluid-project/infusion/tests/framework-tests/preferences/js/AuxBuilderTests.js
2015-05-14T16:22:02 <Bosmon> Nothing that a code reviewer wouldn\'t be aware of
2015-05-14T16:22:19 <Justin_o> we have better practices for this with creating new grades now too
2015-05-14T16:22:34 <Justin_o> but i think that does mean it can look at JSON structures :)

2015-05-14T16:24:53 <Bosmon> I will buy you 2.5 beers when I am next there :)
2015-05-14T16:24:56 * gtirloni starts sending vidyo invites to the interwebs, come use our licenses!
2015-05-14T16:25:24 <colinclark> Bosmon: Or if we go to that place yzen ilkes, you\'ll only own him 1/2 a beer
2015-05-14T16:25:29 <Bosmon> hahaha
2015-05-14T16:34:16 <Bosmon> The fact that 90% of the duplications consist, for example, of declaring a grade which is, say, a fluid.prefs.enactor, hugely reduces the value of the analysis
2015-05-14T16:35:54 <Bosmon> If we can\'t configure a tool so that, in some configuration, there are 0 false positives, its value is at best suggestive, rather than forming a helpful "dashboard"
2015-05-14T16:36:11 <Bosmon> What would it be like if jshint were always reporting 150 linting failures, or we always had 300 failing tests : P
2015-05-14T16:37:11 <colinclark> one tunes it all out as noise very quickly

2015-05-14T17:11:34 <murilocrivellari> at step 2, the voice over starts reading the welcome message, but if you place the cursor on a panel, it stops, and it won\'t read it entirely. Is that a problem?
2015-05-14T17:11:34 <anastasiac> murilocrivellari, so you mean file a JIRA?

2015-05-14T19:07:40 * kasparnet has quit
2015-05-14T19:11:23 <cindyli> hi Bosmon
2015-05-14T19:12:41 <Bosmon> Hi there cindyli
2015-05-14T19:13:55 <cindyli> Bosmon: we use model listeners to listen to a certain path and do action. is there a way not to do an action for one certain path but do it for all rest paths?
2015-05-14T19:15:24 <Bosmon> cindyli - not in particular, no
2015-05-14T19:15:30 <Bosmon> What is an example of your requirement :)
2015-05-14T19:16:32 <cindyli> in the first discovery tool, we need to save some state information such as visited panel, current panel number, sticky key panel states etc. I\'m now saving those into the same cookie for saving prefs
2015-05-14T19:16:54 <cindyli> the issue is each save would trigger the rendering of all panels
2015-05-14T19:17:14 <cindyli> but we don\'t want to trigger that for saving state info
2015-05-14T19:17:24 <Bosmon> cindyli - why would it trigger rendering, if there is no change in state?
2015-05-14T19:17:51 <cindyli> ok, if there is change in state, i don\'t want to trigger rendering
2015-05-14T19:18:39 <cindyli> the rendering should only be triggered by change on preferences, not states
2015-05-14T19:19:01 <cindyli> so, i\'m saving all state info into a path called "states"
2015-05-14T19:19:12 <Bosmon> cindyli - ok, in that case I suggest you divide the model into two areas, one for holding preferences in preferences.* and ui state in uistate.*
2015-05-14T19:19:26 <Bosmon> And then you can make sure that rendering change only listens to the former paths
2015-05-14T19:19:59 <feriyal> murilocrivellari: Yes sure.
2015-05-14T19:20:42 <cindyli> right. we could do that. just need to figure out how easy to override prefs framework behaviour to save prefs into a particular path, Bosmon
2015-05-14T19:20:51 <cindyli> will try
2015-05-14T19:21:00 <Bosmon> cindyli - i think you already have the "preferenceMap" functionality
2015-05-14T19:21:08 <Bosmon> So it should be easy to add the prefix there, I think
2015-05-14T19:21:22 <cindyli> bingo, smart Bosmon.
2015-05-14T19:21:26 <cindyli> :)
2015-05-14T19:21:31 <cindyli> trying
2015-05-14T19:31:46 <cindyli> Bosmon: seems "preferenceMap" may not help. this map is to map the value from central model to the own panel or enactor model
2015-05-14T19:31:47 <cindyli> "gpii.firstDiscovery.speak": {
2015-05-14T19:31:47 <cindyli> "model.speak": "default"
2015-05-14T19:31:47 <cindyli> }
2015-05-14T19:32:46 <cindyli> when the changed pref goes back to the central model, it will be saved into a path like "gpii_firstDiscovery_speak"
2015-05-14T19:33:13 <cindyli> so, thru preferenceMap, we can change the internal model path but not the path in the central model
2015-05-14T19:33:38 <Bosmon> cindyli - well, it sounds like changing the implementation of preferenceMap is still an economical place to do the prefixing
2015-05-14T19:33:43 <cindyli> i\'m thinking to save state info into a separate cookie using the model of another cmoponent
2015-05-14T19:34:11 <cindyli> Bosmon: you mean change in the prefs framework?
2015-05-14T19:34:52 <Bosmon> cindyli - looks like this is done in a truly monster method in AuxBuilder.js
2015-05-14T19:35:03 <Bosmon> A good opportunity to organise this logic better :)
2015-05-14T19:35:38 <Bosmon> It doesn\'t take a "code quality tool" to tell us that "expandCompositePanels" is more than a factor of 10 too big : P
2015-05-14T19:35:51 <cindyli> haha
2015-05-14T19:36:28 <Bosmon> But yes, round about line 293 of that looks like a convenient single place to do the prefixing
2015-05-14T19:37:47 <cindyli> Bosmon: where should the prefix be supplied? in preferenceMap?
2015-05-14T19:39:33 <Bosmon> cindyli - not supplied anywhere, it should appear in this implementation
2015-05-14T19:39:42 <Bosmon> And then of course be listened to in fluid.prefs.prefsEditor rather than ""
2015-05-14T19:40:03 <cindyli> oh, so it\'s a fixed "preference" prefix
2015-05-14T19:40:09 <Bosmon> cindyli - right
2015-05-14T19:40:21 <cindyli> ok
2015-05-14T19:40:51 <Bosmon> I guess it\'s "lucky" that the individual panels don\'t seem to have any particular model idiom
2015-05-14T19:40:59 <Bosmon> And that it is all handled centrally in prefsEditor
2015-05-14T19:45:43 * sepideh joined the channel
2015-05-14T19:51:36 <Bosmon> colinclark - before you do your "big merge" I was thinking it might be a good point to tag a "1.9 release" or so
2015-05-14T19:51:45 <Bosmon> Since this will represent our final point of "no going back"
2015-05-14T19:51:52 <colinclark> yes, that\'s a good point
2015-05-14T19:51:59 <colinclark> I likely won\'t get to merging until mid-next week
2015-05-14T19:52:01 <Bosmon> I imagine we don\'t really need to do anything about actually releasing, but it would be good to know exactly where in our history this moment is
2015-05-14T19:52:06 <colinclark> given that it\'s a big pull reuqest
2015-05-14T19:52:15 <colinclark> and I will likely test it with some of our "users"
2015-05-14T19:52:24 <Bosmon> e.g. yourself? : P
2015-05-14T19:52:27 <colinclark> :P
2015-05-14T19:52:42 <colinclark> I understand a large and secretive financial services project has just done the upgrade :P

2015-05-14T14:21:13 <gtirloni> anastasiac: i\'ve updated IDI-145 with a pull request. i think it can be merged with the development and master branches (if you think http://dev.inclusivedesign.ca looks good)
2015-05-14T14:21:54 <anastasiac> murilocrivella, I wonder if you could help by testing the high-contrast themes; I\xe2\x80\x99ve just issued a pull request. I could make my branch available for you, and you could check if I\xe2\x80\x99ve missed anything. That would save cindyli or Justin_o some time
2015-05-14T14:22:05 <anastasiac> gtirloni, thanks, I\xe2\x80\x99ll have a look
2015-05-14T14:22:27 <anastasiac> murilocrivellari: ^ (sorry, I mis-typed your name0

2015-05-14T14:24:45 <murilocrivellari> anastasiac: the link is not working...
2015-05-14T14:25:44 <anastasiac> murilocrivellari: try this: http://10.4.46.35:8888/Floe/source/first-discovery/demos/

2015-05-14T15:23:55 <Justin_o> cindyli: could you please take a look at my FLOE-325 pull request https://github.com/fluid-project/first-discovery/pull/46
2015-05-14T15:24:07 <cindyli> sure, Justin_o
2015-05-14T15:24:13 <Justin_o> thanks
2015-05-14T15:25:59 <murilocrivellari> anastasiac: I just commented on the pull request. Everything looks fine
2015-05-14T15:26:09 <anastasiac> thanks, murilocrivellari

2015-05-14T15:27:23 <Justin_o> avtar, gtirloni: when would you like to do a follow up community meeting for the ansible playbook and rules?
2015-05-14T15:27:33 <Justin_o> http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Community+workshops
2015-05-14T15:27:42 <Justin_o> Any time after July 1 is free
2015-05-14T15:28:29 <gtirloni> Justin_o: July 8 is fine for me
2015-05-14T15:29:15 <avtar> the 8th works for me as well

2015-05-14T15:48:11 <Justin_o> gtirloni, avtar: great, thanks.. i\'ll book that day
2015-05-14T15:48:39 <Justin_o> gtirloni: i wanted to ask you about the pull request you made to the first discovery tool for the code climate badge too
2015-05-14T15:48:58 <gtirloni> Justin_o: ah sure
2015-05-14T15:49:40 <Justin_o> gtirloni: first question is just about background. What\'s the reason to add the badge?
2015-05-14T15:50:43 <gtirloni> no specific reason, i saw it in many github repos and thought maybe it\'d be nice to have that (easy to track status).. if codeclimate is considered useful for us at all
2015-05-14T15:53:29 <Justin_o> gtirloni: i had setup a code climate to check infusion, but i think it has problems with reading our code style. We get a bunch of duplication issues because of our calls to fluid.defaults.. we also had an issue because it wasn\'t ignoring files properly... although this might be working now. Not sure.. would you be able to investigate if we can do more
2015-05-14T15:53:29 <Justin_o> configuration for code climate, it would be good at least to exclude all the lib files which are currently giving the first discovery tool most of it\'s really low score.
2015-05-14T15:55:40 <gtirloni> yeah, i don\'t think it\'s an authoritative source on what\'s good or bad. if it\'s misinterpreting our style i wouldn\'t worry much
2015-05-14T15:55:42 <anastasiac> Jess_, you said you had a meeting at 1pm; do you think we\xe2\x80\x99ll get a chance to meet with danaayotte re workshop agenda before that?
2015-05-14T15:55:56 <gtirloni> Justin_o: this is how it excludes directories: http://docs.codeclimate.com/article/289-configuring-your-repository-via-codeclimate-yml
2015-05-14T15:56:00 <Justin_o> gtirloni: here\'s the infusion one by the way https://codeclimate.com/github/fluid-project/infusion
2015-05-14T15:56:42 <gtirloni> the default example excludes test/, must be a common thing
2015-05-14T15:56:48 <colinclark> Justin_o: https://github.com/colinbdclark/Flocking/blob/master/.codeclimate.yml
2015-05-14T15:57:03 <colinclark> My impression is that Code Climate isn\'t 100% well-suited to our codebase
2015-05-14T15:57:20 <colinclark> In part because I think we need to be able to provide it various kinds of hints
2015-05-14T15:57:53 <colinclark> I\'d certainly like to argue that JSON declarations meet a lower risk of "duplication" in Infusion than ordinary code
2015-05-14T15:57:58 <colinclark> but I think that\'s debatable
2015-05-14T15:58:34 <colinclark> When I saw gtirloni\'s pull request I ended up trying it with Flocking and have decided that it provides useful feedback for me as a mostly-solo developer
2015-05-14T15:58:57 <colinclark> i.e. many of its code duplication errors poit out actually legimitate areas of evil in Flocking
2015-05-14T15:59:10 <colinclark> though in a code review culture such as Infusion\'s, its impact may be less
2015-05-14T15:59:22 <colinclark> and I still wonder how we\'ll align it with our non-coding style
2015-05-14T15:59:29 <colinclark> curious about your thoughts, Justin_o
2015-05-14T16:01:40 <Justin_o> colinclark: i\'d like it if we could get it to work well with our "code" style. I\'m afraid that it might cast an incorrect negative perception on our framework.
2015-05-14T16:03:15 <colinclark> I think, conceptually, they\'ve done themselves a real disservice by using this metaphor of grading
2015-05-14T16:03:30 <colinclark> an automated tool is taking a real risk by doing this
2015-05-14T16:03:51 <colinclark> particularly when its rubrics are so vaguely-defined
2015-05-14T16:03:55 <colinclark> and so uncontextual
2015-05-14T16:04:13 * michelled has quit
2015-05-14T16:05:06 <Justin_o> colinclark: i guess this is exactly what we\'re trying to avoid with the dspace
2015-05-14T16:05:14 <colinclark> yes, exactly
2015-05-14T16:05:21 <colinclark> to put metrics in the hands of communities who need them
2015-05-14T16:05:42 <colinclark> and to provide "consumers" with information that they can use to draw their own conclusions
2015-05-14T16:05:52 <Justin_o> right
2015-05-14T16:06:09 <colinclark> I was so happy to get out of high school
2015-05-14T16:06:15 <Justin_o> :)
2015-05-14T16:06:15 <colinclark> Code Climate appears to want to bring us back :P
2015-05-14T16:06:43 <Justin_o> colinclark: i take it you\'d suggest we don\'t add the badge then?
2015-05-14T16:06:50 <colinclark> I dunno
2015-05-14T16:06:55 <colinclark> It\'s a good question
2015-05-14T16:07:14 <colinclark> I won\'t be putting a badge on the Flockign repo
2015-05-14T16:07:27 <colinclark> not because I don\'t agree with many parts of Code Climate\'s analysis
2015-05-14T16:07:32 <gtirloni> i think the badge is not important, i naively assumed there wasn\'t all these issues. i think it\'s fine to close the PR
2015-05-14T16:07:36 <colinclark> but because I think it\'s a bizarre mentality
2015-05-14T16:07:47 <colinclark> gtirloni: i\'m glad you made the PR
2015-05-14T16:07:51 <colinclark> we aren\'t dissing it :)
2015-05-14T16:08:05 <colinclark> I would never have heard about it otherwise
2015-05-14T16:08:11 <colinclark> and it is an interesting thing
2015-05-14T16:08:40 <gtirloni> no worries :)
2015-05-14T16:09:24 <Justin_o> gtirloni, colinclark: do you know if we can add the code climate configuration without committing the yaml file to the repo?
2015-05-14T16:09:50 <gtirloni> they used to allow the configuration to be done through their website, but have since removed that
2015-05-14T16:10:06 <gtirloni> i think the yaml file is the only way now
2015-05-14T16:10:08 <Justin_o> i\'m also open to trying out code climate in first discovery to see if we could effectively use it as a tool to improve the code, much like we use linting
2015-05-14T16:10:41 <Justin_o> colinclark: what do you think about that?
2015-05-14T16:11:08 <Justin_o> so i guess we\'d commit the yaml config file and see how things look through their interface
2015-05-14T16:11:41 <colinclark> sadly, that\'s the only way to see it
2015-05-14T16:11:46 <colinclark> it\'s really quite lame, to be honest
2015-05-14T16:12:00 <colinclark> having to stick this yaml file in your repo, just to be able to make basic corrections
2015-05-14T16:12:09 * sepideh has quit
2015-05-14T16:12:22 <Bosmon> For what it\'s worth, I\'m against the idea
2015-05-14T16:12:24 <Justin_o> colinclark: yah, it would be quicker to address issues before you merged them
2015-05-14T16:12:30 <colinclark> I\'m fairly convinced that some marketing wonk made this decision
2015-05-14T16:12:32 <Bosmon> I don\'t think this tool is suited to our coding mentality
2015-05-14T16:12:47 <colinclark> "Oh let\'s put our file in everyone\'s repositories, it\'s free marketing"
2015-05-14T16:12:56 <Bosmon> And it is designed for projects which don\'t have our healthy code review culture
2015-05-14T16:13:09 <Bosmon> Anything which gets into our main repo has already had 2 or 3 real human beings look at it : P
2015-05-14T16:13:17 <colinclark> poor gtirloni closed all his pull requests :(
2015-05-14T16:13:21 <Justin_o> Bosmon: it is easy to add duplication in, especially with a large project
2015-05-14T16:13:42 <Bosmon> Justin_o - just try it :)
2015-05-14T16:13:45 <Justin_o> i liked that this tool could catch real cases for that
2015-05-14T16:14:02 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i\'m sure i\'ve slipped some in already ;)
2015-05-14T16:14:27 <Justin_o> just think of all the linting errors we had before we got the grunt tool working
2015-05-14T16:14:32 <Bosmon> Sure
2015-05-14T16:14:38 <Justin_o> although those are easier to miss
2015-05-14T16:14:38 <Bosmon> Lint is quite a different proposition
2015-05-14T16:14:43 <Bosmon> Given that the committer can run it privately
2015-05-14T16:14:57 <Bosmon> But it took us long enough even to get a set of linting standards we were happy with
2015-05-14T16:15:09 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yeah, i wish we could have something that offered us tools like code climate that we could run from the command line
2015-05-14T16:15:14 <Justin_o> that\'s true
