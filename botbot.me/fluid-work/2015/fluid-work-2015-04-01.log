2015-04-01T12:48:39 <the-t-in-rtf> Hi, All.  I am working on some transformations in which (unfortunately) the original data has actual null values.  Is there a way to tell fluid.transforms.value and/or the shorthand version of same to ignore these?
2015-04-01T12:52:45 * cindyli joined the channel
2015-04-01T12:52:50 <Bosmon> No particular way, unfortunately
2015-04-01T12:53:18 <Bosmon> I suggest that you censor them out in an initial pass yourself, perhaps as part of the same sanitization which you use to remove the "$t" values
2015-04-01T12:54:02 * Justin_o joined the channel
2015-04-01T12:55:31 <the-t-in-rtf> Different data.
2015-04-01T12:55:42 <the-t-in-rtf> I am atoning for my earlier sins and componentizing the EASTIN import
2015-04-01T12:55:50 <the-t-in-rtf> so that it can use the new components I wrote for the GARI import
2015-04-01T12:56:12 <the-t-in-rtf> I can write a pruning function along those lines, I was just hoping I wouldn\'t have to.

2015-04-01T13:14:58 <Justin_o> thanks for helping me find that bug yesterday
2015-04-01T13:15:10 <Bosmon> No problem, Justin_o - I\'ll take a look

2015-04-01T16:03:00 <colinclark> yup
2015-04-01T16:03:12 <clown> thanks colinclark
2015-04-01T16:03:42 * clown colinclark doesn\'t look anything like jhernandez, but he\'ll do for now...
2015-04-01T16:04:03 <colinclark> sheesh
2015-04-01T16:04:15 <colinclark> certainly I\'m not as cool as jhernandez
2015-04-01T16:04:23 <clown> well, who is?
2015-04-01T16:07:45 <gtirloni> fluid-everyone: #fluid-design is open again, thanks!
2015-04-01T16:17:33 <anastasiac> cindyli, I just noticed that the text of the \xe2\x80\x9chelp\xe2\x80\x9d button is not coming from a message bundle, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard-coded into the demo HTML file
2015-04-01T16:22:33 <cindyli> anastasiac: i think it\'s because the help button is not script rendered. it right now comes straight from index.html. to fix it, we can make a simple component for it and retrieve the text form the message bundle.
2015-04-01T16:31:29 <jhernandez> xDD
2015-04-01T16:31:37 <jhernandez> clown: colinclark just seen this

2015-04-01T16:40:59 <Bosmon> slim_jim - I\'m aware of this page, which is partially relevant: http://wiki.gpii.net/w/GPII_Technical_Governance
2015-04-01T16:41:23 * sepideh joined the channel
2015-04-01T16:41:24 <Bosmon> Oh yes, it links to this page: http://wiki.gpii.net/w/GPII_Technical_Standards
2015-04-01T16:44:36 <Justin_o> danaayotte: i was looking into FLOE-295
2015-04-01T16:44:51 <Justin_o> for only changing the size of the text and not the controls
2015-04-01T16:44:57 <slim_jim> Bosmon: thanks. That\'s wahat I was looking for but doesn\'t menton a branch. Is there a branch naming or commit comment convention?
2015-04-01T16:45:03 <danaayotte> yes Justin_o
2015-04-01T16:45:14 <Bosmon> slim_jim - the branch should have the same name as the JIRA you are working on
2015-04-01T16:45:25 <Justin_o> danaayotte: i was thinking of using rem for text and em for other sizes.. however because we have spots where the font-size is changed, those will affect em values as well
2015-04-01T16:45:26 <Bosmon> And the commit comment should start with the JIRA name followed by colon
2015-04-01T16:45:39 <Bosmon> E.g. GPII-17: etc.
2015-04-01T16:46:06 <Justin_o> danaayotte: i might be able to rework the styling to be more specific to where enlarged font sizes are set, but if that isn\'t possible, are you okay with all the text being the same size?
2015-04-01T16:46:31 <slim_jim> Bosman - ack! Thanks. I\'ll update wiki
2015-04-01T16:46:34 <danaayotte> not sure what you mean Justin_o. Which font size is different from the rest?
2015-04-01T16:46:36 <Justin_o> danaayotte: if i\'m not explaining things well, feel free to ping me on vidyo
2015-04-01T16:46:44 <Justin_o> did you want to screen share?
