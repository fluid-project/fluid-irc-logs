b"2015-07-02T18:39:25 <avtar> seems to have some windows support as well
2015-07-02T18:42:17 <simonjb> that serverspec thing looks really neat
2015-07-02T18:44:29 <gtirloni> simonjb, yes, fedora now has workstation, server and cloud versions. we'll use the workstation one (which defaults to gnome3)
2015-07-02T18:45:04 <alanharnum> it\xe2\x80\x99s really cool - based on Rspec, which the main Ruby behaviour-driven development library
2015-07-02T18:47:04 <simonjb> ah I see gtirloni, their packer config is using the server iso, right? https://github.com/boxcutter/fedora/blob/master/fedora22.json#L155

2015-07-02T19:04:32 <gtirloni> i did a quick test, swaping the server ISO with the workstation ISO, but it fails.. i'll have to investigate. avtar, i think we tried this with those mac mini's right?
2015-07-02T19:04:47 <gtirloni> memory is failing
2015-07-02T19:08:28 <avtar> gtirloni: that's if it's installed on the mini itself
2015-07-02T19:09:00 <avtar> but it should be fine as a vagrant vm

2015-07-02T14:02:50 <kasparnet> he's just cooking
2015-07-02T14:02:59 <simonjb> ah ok
2015-07-02T14:03:01 <kasparnet> but he'll be around after 'lunch'
2015-07-02T14:03:12 <simonjb> maybe could I ask you then?
2015-07-02T14:03:17 <colinclark> i can bring you to him on the ipad if you want simonjb
2015-07-02T14:03:29 <simonjb> oh sure colinclark
2015-07-02T14:03:35 <colinclark> it's sitting in front of kasparnet right now
2015-07-02T14:03:50 <colinclark> just join my room
2015-07-02T14:03:57 <kasparnet> oh - if it's just a question
2015-07-02T14:04:19 <kasparnet> sorry simonjb, thought it was something like a proper 30 mins meeting or the like

2015-07-02T14:37:04 <gtirloni> regarding that big merge that'd break backward compatibility, is that something that will impact gpii's preferences server at this point?
2015-07-02T14:38:36 * the-t-in-rtf has quit
2015-07-02T14:47:02 <colinclark> gtirloni: In theory, all tests have to pass before something gets merged
2015-07-02T14:47:05 <colinclark> and there shouldn't be an impact
2015-07-02T14:47:17 <colinclark> but kasparnet might be able to elaborate on the practice rather than the theory ;)
2015-07-02T14:49:16 <gtirloni> ah ok, no worries. i was wondering if i could use that in my tests already
2015-07-02T14:49:39 <colinclark> The really big Infusion merge is not yet in, gtirloni
2015-07-02T14:49:48 <colinclark> there have been a lot of smaller merges here at the hackathon
2015-07-02T14:50:00 <colinclark> but the big Infusion merge is still only halfway through review

2015-07-02T14:50:25 <colinclark> while Bosmon2 / Bosmon7 upgrades the underlying GPII infrastructure, called Kettle
2015-07-02T14:50:36 <colinclark> and then the GPII components will need to be updated
2015-07-02T14:50:39 <colinclark> so that'll take a while

2015-07-02T16:58:51 <clown_mtg> kasparnet, ok.  But note, I'm in an teleconference until about 2:15 pm my time, so I'll be more than an hour late.

2015-07-02T17:06:31 <colinclark> and I think we probably won't make it until 2:15 pm your time
2015-07-02T17:08:12 <clown_mtg> colinclark:  makes sense.  Will you resechedule it tomorrow sometime?   If so, when?
2015-07-02T17:08:35 * clown_mtg feels like he has ADD at the moment....
2015-07-02T17:08:46 <colinclark> yeah, i know that feeling
2015-07-02T17:09:39 <colinclark> it's pretty likely that we'll reschedule for tomorrow--I'll let you know when we revisit tomorrow's schedule

2015-07-02T18:11:51 <Justin_o> it's been quiet here this week
2015-07-02T18:12:05 <simonjb> totally fine with me
2015-07-02T18:12:20 <Justin_o> okay.. thanks
2015-07-02T18:12:24 <simonjb> I figured it would be a quiet week
2015-07-02T18:12:31 <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: No design/dev crit this week

2015-07-02T18:23:42 <avtar> that could be a good place to start
2015-07-02T18:24:27 <avtar> they seem to have os x templates as well that we might be able to use in the future
2015-07-02T18:24:59 <simonjb> thanks avtar, do those boxes have gnome?
2015-07-02T18:25:40 <simonjb> there seems to be a configurable headless variable
2015-07-02T18:26:28 <avtar> no, but gnome and nvda can be added as part of a provisioning step though
2015-07-02T18:27:54 <simonjb> avtar: how can you tell there is no gnome?
2015-07-02T18:29:37 <avtar> simonjb: i took a look at the kickstart config they're using https://github.com/boxcutter/fedora/blob/master/http/ks-fedora22.cfg
2015-07-02T18:30:13 <avtar> it doesn't include xorg and related packages
2015-07-02T18:30:24 <simonjb> avtar: ah ha, awesome, thanks
2015-07-02T18:32:33 <gtirloni> avtar, boxcutter is what i used as a starting point for our centos7 config too :) i'll take a look
2015-07-02T18:32:55 <avtar> noiiiice
2015-07-02T18:35:04 <avtar> alanharnum, gtirloni, simonjb: they seem to include tests as well https://github.com/boxcutter/fedora/blob/master/test/fedora_spec.rb which is a nice touch
2015-07-02T18:35:19 <alanharnum> yeah it uses serverspec
2015-07-02T18:35:47 <alanharnum> which i just heard about lately, haven\xe2\x80\x99t had much chance to play around with, but looks really neat
2015-07-02T18:36:03 <alanharnum> like unit testing for infrastructure automation
2015-07-02T18:36:11 <simonjb> very nice
2015-07-02T18:36:25 <alanharnum> someone did red-green-refactor for infrastructure live with it at a conference i was at a few weeks back :)
2015-07-02T18:37:16 <simonjb> cool
2015-07-02T18:39:17 <avtar> yeah this looks great http://serverspec.org/resource_types.html
2015-07-02T18:39:24 <simonjb> gtirloni: so we could start with their fedora22 config and add gnome and node?
