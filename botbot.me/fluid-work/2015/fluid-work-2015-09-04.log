2015-09-04T13:40:45 <jhung> I haven\'t finished going through the whole doc yet anastasiac.
2015-09-04T13:40:54 <anastasiac> ah, ok
2015-09-04T13:41:44 <jhung> I\'ll finish it this morning and give you feedback.

2015-09-04T17:39:54 <alanharnum> anastasiac: ok - I can take some time to look today or early next week
2015-09-04T17:40:13 <anastasiac> thanks, alanharnum \xe2\x80\x93\xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ll share the google doc with you

2015-09-04T18:33:42 <anastasiac> cindyli: can I use the renderer to set the value of an attribute on an element? e.g. to use the min/max of a preference range to set the min and max attributes on an input of type \xe2\x80\x98range\xe2\x80\x99? and if so, how would I do that? do we have any examples of that?
2015-09-04T18:34:34 <cindyli> let me check, anastasiac
2015-09-04T18:36:46 <anastasiac> cindyli: would that be a renderer decorator of type \xe2\x80\x98attrs\xe2\x80\x99 maybe?
2015-09-04T18:37:32 <cindyli> you could, anastasiac, but i think the better way is to use afterRender event - https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/components/overviewPanel/js/OverviewPanel.js#L51-L58
2015-09-04T18:38:48 <anastasiac> ah, interesting, cindyli. And would that be appropriate for this purpose? pulling min/max out of the primary schema and setting the attrs on the adjuster? would that be the recommended \xe2\x80\x98best practice\xe2\x80\x99?
2015-09-04T18:40:25 <cindyli> anastasiac: i think it\'s the recommended way
2015-09-04T18:41:28 <anastasiac> cindyli: an input of type range is a slider. Doing this would be effectively changing the range of the slider after it\xe2\x80\x99s been rendered. Might that not result in some odd visual changes?
2015-09-04T18:42:10 * avtar has quit
2015-09-04T18:42:24 <anastasiac> it would render with the default range (which is 0 to 100, i think) then redraw (I assume?) with the new range, which could be anything
2015-09-04T18:42:38 <anastasiac> the \xe2\x80\x98thumb\xe2\x80\x99 might jump around
2015-09-04T18:42:54 <cindyli> ah ha
2015-09-04T18:43:03 * avtar joined the channel
2015-09-04T18:45:45 <cindyli> anastasiac: that\'s a good point. i\'m not sure if afterRender redrawing can be seamless. let me check if there\'s a way to do it with protoTree
2015-09-04T18:51:32 <cindyli> yes, anastasiac, with protoTree - https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/tests/framework-tests/renderer/js/RendererTests.js#L1641-L1646
2015-09-04T18:52:09 <anastasiac> ah,the attrs decorator, that\xe2\x80\x99s what I thought might be it
2015-09-04T18:52:09 <cindyli> as ur initial thoughts ;)
2015-09-04T18:52:15 <anastasiac> thanks, cindyli
2015-09-04T18:52:17 <cindyli> np
2015-09-04T18:52:24 <anastasiac> I might ask you to review the code I\xe2\x80\x99m trying :-)
2015-09-04T18:52:29 <cindyli> sure
2015-09-04T18:58:45 * alanharnum joined the channel
2015-09-04T19:00:51 <simonjb> cindyli: would you be available for some questions about the edit privacy settings component?
2015-09-04T19:01:09 <cindyli> sure, simonjb
2015-09-04T19:01:14 <cindyli> vidyo
2015-09-04T19:01:29 <simonjb> call me when it\'s good cindyli
2015-09-04T19:01:33 <cindyli> sure
2015-09-04T19:15:52 <anastasiac> cindyli: I got my slider to work, but: I had to define the min/max/divisibleBy in the primary schema as strings instead of numbers. If they were numbers, the renderer complained when it tried to work with them: the parser tries to run a string replace() function on the number at some point. Do you know any tricks for dealing with this?
2015-09-04T19:17:34 <cindyli> anastasiac: i\'m in a talk with simonjb, will come back to ur question after that
2015-09-04T19:17:47 <anastasiac> oh, sorry, cindyli (and simonjb). no rush!
2015-09-04T19:40:30 <cindyli> anastasiac: i\'m thinking to use an expander in the decorator to first convert numbers to strings, use toString()
2015-09-04T19:40:56 <cindyli> sounds like an overkill tho
2015-09-04T19:41:05 <anastasiac> yes, it does :-)
2015-09-04T19:41:07 <cindyli> checking if there\'s another way
2015-09-04T19:41:33 <anastasiac> my goal is to use the simplest possible option, cindyli
2015-09-04T19:41:51 <cindyli> understood
2015-09-04T19:49:11 <cindyli> anastasiac: u can do this with "attrs" decorator - https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/tests/framework-tests/renderer/js/RendererTests.js#L1121
2015-09-04T19:49:50 <cindyli> so
2015-09-04T19:49:51 <cindyli> attrs: {
2015-09-04T19:49:54 <cindyli> disabled: $.isNumeric(value): value.toString() : value
2015-09-04T19:49:55 <cindyli> }
2015-09-04T19:50:04 <cindyli> typo
2015-09-04T19:50:12 <cindyli> first : should be ?
2015-09-04T19:50:33 <cindyli> "min": $.isNumeric(min) ? min.toString() : min
2015-09-04T19:50:47 <anastasiac> that looks like it would work, cindyli, but doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that violate the general best practice that the protoTree should be config only, no function?
2015-09-04T19:50:54 <anastasiac> I guess I could use produceTree
2015-09-04T19:51:50 <anastasiac> it would be a good point in the tutorial to introduce the idea of produceTree :-)
2015-09-04T19:52:01 <anastasiac> ok, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give that a try, cindyli, thanks
2015-09-04T19:53:01 <cindyli> certainly, anastasiac. it seems complicating things to use another layer of produceTree just to avoid this line of code.
2015-09-04T19:53:13 <cindyli> well, this line is pretty readable :)
2015-09-04T19:54:44 <anastasiac> I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the readability is the issue, cindyli, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s about serializability; options should be just static config, no?
2015-09-04T19:56:13 <cindyli> yes, maybe. let\'s stick with the best practice
