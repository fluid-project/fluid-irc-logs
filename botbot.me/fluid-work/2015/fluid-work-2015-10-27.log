b'2015-10-27T20:04:10 <Bosmon> fluid-everyone - great news - the latest npm no longer supports the use of git\'s cygwin
2015-10-27T20:04:18 <Bosmon> https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/7456
2015-10-27T20:04:44 <Bosmon> I guess in theory that removes one of Justin_o \'s headaches, just after we had managed to work around it : P
2015-10-27T20:05:39 * jhung has quit
2015-10-27T20:06:53 <Justin_o> Bosmon: which headache was that, was it the path issue for the git command in fluid-publish or one of the syncing issues with the first-discovery-server?
2015-10-27T20:07:02 <Bosmon> Justin_o - the former
2015-10-27T20:07:09 * jhung joined the channel
2015-10-27T20:07:11 <Bosmon> Here\'s another version of the report: https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/7623
2015-10-27T20:07:18 <Justin_o> Bosmon: oh well, it\'s fine how it works now anyways
2015-10-27T20:07:31 <Bosmon> Not even a hint of a workaround
2015-10-27T20:07:50 <Bosmon> At least the npm dev is very polite
2015-10-27T20:08:01 <Justin_o> Bosmon: so how do you use npm?
2015-10-27T20:08:14 <Bosmon> Justin_o - it worked fine with a relatively recent npm
2015-10-27T20:08:24 <Bosmon> I just upgraded to the version of npm that will be LTS for node 4.2.1
2015-10-27T20:08:34 <Bosmon> Which is npm 2.14.7
2015-10-27T20:08:45 <Bosmon> And it is no longer capable of installing git-based dependencies
2015-10-27T20:09:12 <Justin_o> :(
2015-10-27T20:09:28 <Justin_o> at least we\'re actually publishing modules now, but that seems like a serious pain
2015-10-27T20:14:04 <slim_> Bosmon: does the get ever get called?
2015-10-27T20:14:16 <slim_> seeing as how set returns old and new
2015-10-27T20:14:32 <Bosmon> slim_ - our current architecture doesn\'t contain a call to "get", no
2015-10-27T20:14:44 <slim_> thought so :)
2015-10-27T20:14:45 <Bosmon> But one day kasparnet or his illustrious successor will implement the SNAPSHOTTER
2015-10-27T20:17:37 <slim_> yep
2015-10-27T20:17:41 <Bosmon> And on that day, GET will finally be called
2015-10-27T20:17:56 <slim_> perhaps set should call get to be dry and bug free :)
2015-10-27T20:18:04 <slim_> but I wont
2015-10-27T20:18:27 <Bosmon> Well, we expect people to DRY their own code : P
2015-10-27T20:18:36 <alanharnum> "Every time npm has tried to support Cygwin in the past it has ended in tears."
2015-10-27T20:18:48 <alanharnum> that\'s an issue comment with a longer narrative behind it
2015-10-27T20:19:03 <Bosmon> The architecture won\'t replace a "set" with a "get + set" because of the possibility of the underlying settings requiring some kind of transaction to access them cleanly
2015-10-27T20:19:27 <Bosmon> We haven\'t run into such a settings handler yet, but it\'s possible that some such thing might be required on Windows in the end to resolve our SPI + registry issues
2015-10-27T20:20:05 <slim_> good point
2015-10-27T20:27:31 <simonjb> kasparnet or jhernand1z: if I add a new prefs set to testData/preferences/review4/Arthur.json -- is the token "review4/Arthur" or "Arthur"?
2015-10-27T20:29:45 <kasparnet> sorry simonjb, got distracted
2015-10-27T20:29:49 <kasparnet> catching up now
2015-10-27T20:31:23 * anvk has quit
2015-10-27T20:31:45 <kasparnet> simonjb: we\'ll upload all the NP sets from review4 to the preferences server
2015-10-27T20:31:53 <kasparnet> so Arthur will stay "Arthur"
2015-10-27T20:32:20 <simonjb> and for local testing?
2015-10-27T20:32:37 <kasparnet> i generally just copy the NP sets to the preferences folder :S
2015-10-27T20:32:57 * kasparnet is hoping that bosmon doesn\'t see this and starts yelling
2015-10-27T20:33:20 * the-t-in-rtf has quit
2015-10-27T20:33:28 <simonjb> kasparnet: ok I could configure my prefs server to look at review4
2015-10-27T20:34:24 <kasparnet> simonjb: in terms of the review scenario
2015-10-27T20:36:04 <kasparnet> I think your solution sounds sensible -- BUT I think we should go with whatever is doable timewise and you think is sensible... There is enough pressure on you with this stuff as is, and I\'m fine with tweaking the scenario so it fits the implementation
2015-10-27T20:36:33 <slim_> kasparnet: Bosmon I can now log in/out that solution specifi pref.
2015-10-27T20:36:43 <slim_> have to stop now and do other stuff tomorrow
2015-10-27T20:36:53 <kasparnet> slim_: cool
2015-10-27T20:36:56 <slim_> have push and will add a couple of comments
2015-10-27T20:37:01 <kasparnet> and the resolution is changing, etc
2015-10-27T20:37:05 <kasparnet> ?*
2015-10-27T20:37:14 <slim_> kasparnet: indeed! but only on main display.
2015-10-27T20:37:21 <Bosmon> slim_ - fantastic
2015-10-27T20:37:23 <Bosmon> Great work!
2015-10-27T20:37:24 <slim_> multi monitors setups will be phase 2
2015-10-27T20:37:31 <slim_> if eva :)
2015-10-27T20:37:32 * cindyli has quit
2015-10-27T20:37:36 <kasparnet> that\'s awesome slim
2015-10-27T20:37:52 <slim_> so need to get working with "low" etc
2015-10-27T20:38:05 <slim_> but thats all in the transforms
2015-10-27T20:38:11 <kasparnet> If you make sure to push it (with any relevant instructions), I\'ll try it out tomorrow and probably do the transformations stuff as well
2015-10-27T20:38:40 <slim_> it took way longer than I expected - but have learnt lot and might be able to write that book soon :-P
2015-10-27T20:38:53 <slim_> pushed now - just going to add comments to PRs
2015-10-27T20:41:27 <simonjb> okay, thanks kasparnet, I\'ll take a look and if I can get something workable and is easy, I\'ll do it
2015-10-27T20:42:08 <kasparnet> great simonjb, but as said: tweak as necessary :)

2015-10-27T20:53:09 <simonjb> kasparnet: how about we just prefix the review4 prefs sets with "review4_", as in "review4_Arthur.json"

2015-10-27T20:58:15 <Bosmon> So - in case anyone is interested in how this saga ends, I managed to get "GIT FOR WINDOWS" working in a mere half an hour
2015-10-27T20:58:55 <Bosmon> Interestingly, it was necessary to set the GIT_SSH environment variable to point to my already existing and working copy of SSH in Cygwin
2015-10-27T20:58:56 <Bosmon> http://guides.beanstalkapp.com/version-control/git-on-windows.html
2015-10-27T20:59:33 <Bosmon> SInce the one bundled in the so-called "git bash" that comes with "git for windows" (actually, it seems, a complete msys install, complete with a few bizarre utilities borrowed from cygwin) doesn\'t work a damn
2015-10-27T20:59:49 <Bosmon> "git bash" also came included with a version of chmod that does absolutely nothing at all

2015-10-27T21:40:29 <Bosmon> Hi Justin_o
2015-10-27T21:40:39 <Bosmon> I tracked down your issues with the first discovery server
2015-10-27T21:40:48 <Bosmon> If I had been more careful, I would have tracked them down earlier
2015-10-27T21:40:59 <Bosmon> The issue is that you have a stale "require" at the head of the file
2015-10-27T21:41:03 <Bosmon> require("jqUnit")
2015-10-27T21:41:14 <Bosmon> Which picks up the dead version of the old node module
2015-10-27T21:41:32 <Bosmon> If I had just carefully done an rm -rf node_modules before testing, I could have saved myself a lot of time :)
2015-10-27T21:46:16 * Jess_ joined the channel
2015-10-27T21:47:01 <colinclark> I wrote myself a script for osc.js
2015-10-27T21:47:03 <colinclark> a very dumb one
2015-10-27T21:47:29 <colinclark> https://github.com/colinbdclark/osc.js/pull/34/files#diff-21cc2bccf0277f3ae2b6e4afdb64aa7fR1
2015-10-27T21:47:53 <colinclark> Which I run whenever the Vagrant box is provisioned: https://github.com/colinbdclark/osc.js/pull/34/files#diff-d6d618aa6069c63a6811c544dffdc9d2R27
2015-10-27T21:52:23 * Jess_ has quit
2015-10-27T21:55:49 <Bosmon> colinclark - these issues will be much more dangerous with npm 3
2015-10-27T21:55:59 <colinclark> how come?
2015-10-27T21:55:59 <Bosmon> IN which ones chances of getting a "stray require" are hugely magnified
2015-10-27T21:56:07 <Bosmon> Because every dependency of every project will be dumped at top level
2015-10-27T21:56:12 <colinclark> ah
2015-10-27T21:56:16 <colinclark> we hope :P
2015-10-27T21:56:23 <colinclark> in practice, didn\'t we realize that it probably won\'t

b'2015-10-27T18:54:19 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, it is explained
2015-10-27T18:55:09 <Justin_o> Bosmon: cool, so i need to wait for node-jqunit to be added as a dependency in kettle?
2015-10-27T18:55:20 <Bosmon> Justin_o - it IS a dependency of Kettle!
2015-10-27T18:55:24 <Bosmon> In my branch
2015-10-27T18:56:07 <Justin_o> Bosmon: but it\'s a devDependency so it won\'t be included when i install your package
2015-10-27T18:56:15 <Justin_o> install kettle from your branch
2015-10-27T18:56:16 <Bosmon> Justin_o - but it has only EVER been a devDependency : P
2015-10-27T18:56:25 <Bosmon> Whatever it was called
2015-10-27T18:56:44 <Justin_o> but it wasn\'t used in the test file before
2015-10-27T18:56:52 <Justin_o> or at least in the version i was using before
2015-10-27T18:57:08 <Justin_o> Bosmon: ^
2015-10-27T18:57:10 <Bosmon> Justin_o - everything today is identical to the way it was before
2015-10-27T18:57:17 <Bosmon> The issue is your OWN dependency on jqUnit, remember?
2015-10-27T18:57:17 <Bosmon> https://github.com/GPII/first-discovery-server/blob/master/package.json#L37
2015-10-27T18:57:27 <Justin_o> Bosmon: no i don\'t remember that
2015-10-27T18:57:45 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I mentioned it 6 minutes ago :)
2015-10-27T18:58:04 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i was saying that this is the old file in the version of kettle that i was using https://github.com/amb26/kettle/blob/33e2826e78315c6d29b13c8ba810f54fef29e8ac/lib/test/KettleTestUtils.js
2015-10-27T18:58:09 <Justin_o> and it didn\'t use node-jqunit
2015-10-27T18:58:37 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I suggest you review the conversation so far
2015-10-27T18:58:43 <Bosmon> I\'m not sure how I can explain the situation any better : P
2015-10-27T18:58:48 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i\'m so confused
2015-10-27T18:59:04 <Bosmon> All that has happened is that a package that we both depend on for tests has changed package name
2015-10-27T18:59:11 <Bosmon> It used to be called "jqUnit", now it is called "node-jqunit"
2015-10-27T18:59:21 <Bosmon> This had to happen because "jqUnit" is not a valid npm package name
2015-10-27T18:59:26 <Bosmon> That is, it wouldn\'t let me publish a package with this name
2015-10-27T18:59:47 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay, so i can change to that but i still think it needs to be a dependency in kettle, not a dev dependency
2015-10-27T19:00:02 <Justin_o> what if my package didn\'t even use node-jqunit or jQunit as a dependency at all
2015-10-27T19:00:05 <Justin_o> then kettle would break
2015-10-27T19:00:20 <Bosmon> Yes, but it could only happen if you were using Kettle\'s TESTING support
2015-10-27T19:00:21 <Justin_o> it would seem that i couldn\'t do an npm install kettle and have a  working version
2015-10-27T19:00:27 <Bosmon> This file is only loaded when you issue loadTestingSupport
2015-10-27T19:00:32 <Bosmon> Which implies that you have tests of your own
2015-10-27T19:00:41 <Bosmon> Which implies that you should have loaded node-jqunit
2015-10-27T19:00:47 <Justin_o> but i don\'t have to use jqUnit for my own tests right?
2015-10-27T19:01:18 <Bosmon> Justin_o - well, you currently do use it.... and you would need to include it in order to use Kettle\'s testing support
2015-10-27T19:01:33 <Justin_o> Bosmon: sure, but i\'m not just thinking about this case i guess
2015-10-27T19:02:14 <Justin_o> Bosmon: it just seems that in the way it is currently structured, Kettle ships without all of it\'s own dependencies.
2015-10-27T19:03:12 <Bosmon> Justin_o - well, it has always been this way - and it is something that npm doesn\'t properly handle, really
2015-10-27T19:03:25 <Bosmon> The way npm thinks about "devDependencies" is completely faulty
2015-10-27T19:03:31 <Bosmon> As we keep finding....
2015-10-27T19:03:41 <Bosmon> We can think about this issue further, since it\'s definitely a problem
2015-10-27T19:03:47 <Justin_o> yes, lots of npm headaches lately
2015-10-27T19:03:48 <Bosmon> But it\'s not really clear how to solve it
2015-10-27T19:04:22 <Justin_o> Bosmon: is it possible to split kettle and the kettle testing support into separate packages?
2015-10-27T19:04:49 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, we could make a fresh "micromodule"
2015-10-27T19:04:55 <Bosmon> Although really we need to refactor everything
2015-10-27T19:05:05 <Justin_o> that sounds like a  lot of work
2015-10-27T19:05:14 <Bosmon> I mean by "everything", Infusion
2015-10-27T19:05:28 <Bosmon> Since really node-jqunit should be part of that cloud of packages
2015-10-27T19:06:01 <Justin_o> Bosmon: so it\'s REALLY a lot of work
2015-10-27T19:06:19 * simonjb has quit
2015-10-27T19:06:20 <Bosmon> Yes, we will just have to add this to our heap of things to rethink
2015-10-27T19:06:28 <Justin_o> Bosmon: also what was wrong with jQunit as a package name, just the capitalization?
2015-10-27T19:06:43 <Bosmon> In the meantime we will have to say, "If you depend on Kettle\'s testing support, you need to include node-jqunit as one of your OWN dev dependencies"
2015-10-27T19:06:56 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay
2015-10-27T19:07:26 <colinclark> I will say two things
2015-10-27T19:07:33 <Bosmon> colinclark - say on!
2015-10-27T19:07:35 <colinclark> 1. Thanks, Justin_o, for talking through it with Bosmon
2015-10-27T19:07:42 <colinclark> I have benefitted from reading along
2015-10-27T19:07:56 <colinclark> As I say, I got burned by the jqunit change this weekend
2015-10-27T19:08:08 <colinclark> and it\'s nice to learn about many of the issues with it
2015-10-27T19:08:21 <colinclark> 2. It will be such an awesome world when we have Infusion factored into more modules
2015-10-27T19:08:44 <colinclark> Thinking about that makes me especially enthusiastic about Infusion
2015-10-27T19:08:59 <colinclark> powered by a really smart build system that uses package.json metadata
2015-10-27T19:09:26 <colinclark> I am slightly worried about the modularized world from a development perspective (for exactly the reasons we talked about earlier in regards to Vagrant)
2015-10-27T19:09:31 <Justin_o> colinclark: do we have an eta for when we\'ll get to work on that stuff
2015-10-27T19:09:46 <colinclark> Justin_o: As you soon as you have time for it ;)
2015-10-27T19:10:25 <Justin_o> colinclark: :) i might forget to work on some other things for a while ;)
2015-10-27T19:10:29 <colinclark> hahaha
2015-10-27T19:10:38 <colinclark> if michelled were here...
2015-10-27T19:10:51 <colinclark> I can imagine we can find a way to connect it to our Prosperity4All work
2015-10-27T19:11:05 <colinclark> we really need to show how Infusion can support the development of adaptive user interfaces more easily
2015-10-27T19:11:12 * kasparnet has quit
2015-10-27T19:11:14 <Justin_o> colinclark: that\'d be great
2015-10-27T19:11:17 <colinclark> and a big part of what I wrote into the DOW included things like tooling
2015-10-27T19:11:19 <colinclark> particularly debugging tools
2015-10-27T19:11:26 <colinclark> but the key with this stuff is to have a tangible demo
2015-10-27T19:11:42 <colinclark> of an "adaptable UI" and how increased modularity and better debugging tools supported it
2015-10-27T19:11:59 <colinclark> Ideally, we will draw from Floe to do this
2015-10-27T19:12:19 <colinclark> in that, in the ontology of Prosperity4All, we are contributing to two different sections
2015-10-27T19:12:22 * kasparnet joined the channel
2015-10-27T19:12:31 <colinclark> SP2, which you can think of as the "building blocks" that support accessible development
2015-10-27T19:12:41 <colinclark> and SP3, which you can think of as the applications that are using the building blocks
2015-10-27T19:13:03 <colinclark> so ideally we\'ll find a nice way to weave together an adaptive application for Floe, using the new features of Infusion
2015-10-27T19:13:16 <colinclark> I\'m thinking our chart authoring tool will be a great example if we can get it far enough along
2015-10-27T19:13:27 <colinclark> since we\'ve talked a lot about the importance of supporting different types of presentations
2015-10-27T19:13:31 <colinclark> visual, sonic, and textural
2015-10-27T19:13:35 <colinclark> textual
2015-10-27T19:13:59 <Justin_o> textural sounded really interesting, maybe for the next grant
2015-10-27T19:14:00 <colinclark> and personalizability in terms of people\'s different sensitivities and affinities to those things
2015-10-27T19:14:04 <colinclark> Justin_o: :)
2015-10-27T19:14:21 <colinclark> I forget if you got to meet David Bobier from the Vibrafusion Lab
2015-10-27T19:14:26 <colinclark> I guess he\'s thinking texturally in a way
2015-10-27T19:14:27 <colinclark> :)
2015-10-27T19:14:39 <Justin_o> colinclark: hmm.. i might have seen him walk through
2015-10-27T19:15:35 <colinclark> anyway, that\'s the key
2015-10-27T19:15:38 <Justin_o> I think haptics and etc might be in for a boost now that apple is pushing it. at least i expect more related tech to start popping up.
2015-10-27T19:15:43 <colinclark> yes
2015-10-27T19:17:30 * alanharnum has quit
2015-10-27T19:23:58 <jhung> Justin_o, colinclark: I was wondering if either of you can chime in on the docs-platform discussion on list? It looks like we would like to get this contributed to the Fluid project, but don\'t know what that process looks like.
2015-10-27T19:25:22 <colinclark> jhung: You can follow along with the process that has happened recently in the GPII organization
2015-10-27T19:25:33 <colinclark> sgithens had a nice refinement to the process
2015-10-27T19:25:48 <colinclark> I think you\'ve passed the lazy consensus long ago
2015-10-27T19:25:54 <colinclark> so I think it\'s quite simple from here
2015-10-27T19:26:03 <colinclark> 1. File a JIRA about transferring ownership of the repo(s)
2015-10-27T19:26:27 <colinclark> 2. Work with Justin_o or Bosmon or me or someone to actually do #1
2015-10-27T19:26:38 <colinclark> I didn\'t entirely follow what exactly the process is
2015-10-27T19:26:52 <colinclark> but I\'m sure someone can explain, since we just did it for the First Discovery Tool
2015-10-27T19:28:40 <colinclark> Justin_o: Are you familiar with the process of transferring ownership from an individual\'s repository to the fluid-project organization?
2015-10-27T19:30:21 <colinclark> danayo: I found it!
2015-10-27T19:30:40 <colinclark> A 68K Mac emulator, along with versions of the System software from version 2 upwards
2015-10-27T19:30:47 <danayo> sweet!
2015-10-27T19:30:54 <colinclark> And a copy of Hypercard 1.0.1E
2015-10-27T19:30:59 <danayo> excellent
2015-10-27T19:31:02 <colinclark> and, as a bonus, THE FIRST VERSION OF PHOTOSHOP EVER!
2015-10-27T19:31:08 <danayo> O M G
2015-10-27T19:31:18 <danayo> this is going to be FUN
2015-10-27T19:31:24 <colinclark> let me make sure it still works
2015-10-27T19:31:26 <Justin_o> colinclark, jhung: i\'ve only done mine for a personal repo, but i think in general you can file a transfer of ownership. If that doesn\'t work you\'d have to add one of us to the repo first then we can do the transfer
2015-10-27T19:31:28 <danayo> ok
2015-10-27T19:31:30 <colinclark> you\'re running Yosemite, danayo?
2015-10-27T19:31:33 <danayo> yes
2015-10-27T19:31:37 <colinclark> ok
2015-10-27T19:34:50 * simonjb joined the channel
2015-10-27T19:37:05 * alanharnum joined the channel
2015-10-27T19:45:29 * michelled joined the channel
2015-10-27T19:53:41 <Justin_o> Bosmon, the-t-in-rtf: so my tests don\'t seem to running with the latest version of kettle
2015-10-27T19:53:55 <Bosmon> Hi there Justin_o
2015-10-27T19:53:57 <Justin_o> Bosmon: it appears that the request is being fired, but the listener isn\'t being triggered
2015-10-27T19:53:59 <Bosmon> What problem do you get?
2015-10-27T19:54:08 <Bosmon> ok
2015-10-27T19:54:08 <Justin_o> Bosmon:
2015-10-27T19:54:09 <Justin_o> jq: Failure in fixture file - no tests were queued - FAIL
2015-10-27T19:55:36 <simonjb> hey kasparnet, are you around?
2015-10-27T19:55:50 <kasparnet> simonjb: yeah
2015-10-27T19:55:54 <kasparnet> (ish) :)
2015-10-27T19:55:58 <Bosmon> Justin_o - can you check it in to a branch and I will take a look
2015-10-27T19:56:08 <simonjb> kasparnet: I\'m just looking over https://wiki.gpii.net/w/Year_4_Review_Integration_Roadmap_%28C4A%29#Demonstration_5:_Demonstration_of_Security_UIs
2015-10-27T19:56:08 <Justin_o> Bosmon: just doing that now
2015-10-27T19:56:25 <simonjb> and thinking of our conversation about the default privacy policy
2015-10-27T19:56:38 <Justin_o> Bosmon: https://github.com/jobara/first-discovery-server/blob/FLOE-430/tests/js/preferencesRouter-tests.js
2015-10-27T19:56:40 <Justin_o> those are the tests
2015-10-27T19:56:48 <Justin_o> you can checkout my FLOE-430 branch
2015-10-27T19:56:56 <Bosmon> Cheers, Justin_o
2015-10-27T19:57:11 <simonjb> in order to do the step "he creates a new privacy policy for NVDA" we really need to have some default policy support
2015-10-27T19:57:39 <simonjb> kasparnet: if we don\'t and we want NVDA to launch initially, we can only do that if a privacy policy exists
2015-10-27T19:57:55 <simonjb> and then we wouldn\'t be adding one
2015-10-27T19:58:34 <simonjb> so, I think we\'ll need some sort of default privacy policy support to demo the scenario as described
2015-10-27T20:00:37 <simonjb> kasparnet: I\'m thinking to put something together that (1) does not have a UI -- the default policy exists only in the datastore and (2) only applies to the hybrid flow manager (not the oauth2 web app style integration)
2015-10-27T20:00:52 <simonjb> kasparnet: reasonable?

b'2015-10-27T17:38:26 <Bosmon> slim_ - it\'s all just virtualbox in the end anyway
2015-10-27T17:38:35 <Bosmon> So it\'s SIX OF ONE and HALF A DOZEN OF THE OTHER
2015-10-27T17:38:53 <Bosmon> Are you a Patrick McGoohan fan? : P
2015-10-27T17:39:02 <slim_> Bosmon: hehe
2015-10-27T17:40:14 <slim_> kasper why is that application specific?
2015-10-27T17:40:32 <slim_> my mind is blowm :(
2015-10-27T17:41:09 <Bosmon> slim_ - the term\'s name is in the "http://registry.gpii.net/applications" namespace
2015-10-27T17:41:20 <Bosmon> Which implies that it is sent directly to the app without being ontologised
2015-10-27T17:41:35 <Bosmon> You may be aware that there are lots of different vocabularies for describing the space of preferences
2015-10-27T17:41:45 <Bosmon> And by using this namespace you sidestep all these vocabulary issues
2015-10-27T17:41:54 <Bosmon> But the downside is that your settings are not portable from one app to another
2015-10-27T17:41:58 <Bosmon> Or one OS to another
2015-10-27T17:42:06 <slim_> Bosmon: I am aware there is LOTS I DONT UNDERSTAND !
2015-10-27T17:42:23 <Bosmon> BUt it is a way of simplifying the situation by cutting out part of the matchmaking workflow
2015-10-27T17:42:34 <slim_> Bosmon: gotcha!
2015-10-27T17:42:41 <Bosmon> slim_ - well, you are a valuable resource in this respect
2015-10-27T17:42:52 <Bosmon> SInce when you do understand, you can then explain what it was you didn\'t understand :)
2015-10-27T17:42:56 <slim_> thanks. I think.....
2015-10-27T17:43:02 <Bosmon> And then, preferably, write it on a wiki page :)
2015-10-27T17:43:34 <slim_> "I know nothing" as manuel in Fawlty Towers said
2015-10-27T17:43:45 <slim_> that\'s was a very obvious hint
2015-10-27T17:43:56 <Bosmon> DOOR! DOOR!
2015-10-27T17:44:00 <Bosmon> WHERE IS DOOR!
2015-10-27T17:44:08 <Bosmon> YOU O\'REILLY MEN :)
2015-10-27T17:44:23 <slim_> hehe - in the wrong wall!
2015-10-27T17:44:39 <Bosmon> I guess we can dream that before too long there really WILL be the O\'REILLY guide to the GPII
2015-10-27T17:44:43 <Bosmon> And you might be the man to write it :)
2015-10-27T17:45:03 <slim_> I quite like the idea
2015-10-27T17:45:05 <Bosmon> You could even get to choose what animal it is
2015-10-27T17:45:22 <slim_> hmmm - that will be fun - but are there many left
2015-10-27T17:46:03 <slim_> jabberwock?
2015-10-27T17:46:04 <Bosmon> Well only about 5,000 or so
2015-10-27T17:46:12 <Justin_o> Bosmon: seems you were right about the problem. I deleted the node_modules repo on my host machine and the vm created properly. I\'m going to try again with the KETTLE-32 branch.
2015-10-27T17:46:12 <Bosmon> At least, if you are counting mammalian species : P
2015-10-27T17:46:28 <Bosmon> Justin_o - cool
2015-10-27T17:46:47 <Bosmon> So we\'d better get together with avtar some time and see if we can think of a way of reducing the likelihood of this kind of problem
2015-10-27T17:47:10 <Justin_o> Bosmon: so the two way sync doesn\'t remove files?
2015-10-27T17:47:21 <Bosmon> I think given avtar\'s enormous fondness for RSYNC perhaps one way of attacking the problem might be to supply the options necessary for it to eliminate files that have gone missing
2015-10-27T17:47:24 <Bosmon> I am sure it will have such options
2015-10-27T17:47:32 <Bosmon> Since it has about 3,000 pages worth of options
2015-10-27T17:47:59 <Justin_o> haha
2015-10-27T17:48:24 <slim_> kasparnet: aha - "Reference to non-existing settingshandler block named configuration in solution com.microsoft.windows.screenResolution",
2015-10-27T17:48:28 <slim_> whatever that means
2015-10-27T17:48:36 <slim_> somehting in code not exposed correctly?
2015-10-27T17:50:42 <colinclark> Bosmon, Justin_o: The situation gets even worse when you have platform-specific node modules that you depend on
2015-10-27T17:50:45 <slim_> oh - thats prolly those little extra its at the end of solution defintion. I just copied them assumuing are needed
2015-10-27T17:50:51 <colinclark> even, for example, the "ws" library
2015-10-27T17:51:11 <kasparnet> yup easy fix, sec slim_
2015-10-27T17:51:12 <colinclark> if you do any cross-environment development, for example running both on your local machine and in the Vagrant box as well
2015-10-27T17:51:21 <colinclark> errors are subtle and easy to mis
2015-10-27T17:51:22 <colinclark> miss
2015-10-27T17:51:33 <Justin_o> colinclark: i was worried about that, which is why i had not wanted to sync the node_modules directory, but i guess there are cases where that is also needed
2015-10-27T17:51:42 <kasparnet> if you rename this: https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/280/files#diff-50d3e47e1949cc16a5b210192f981d28R984 to \'settings\'
2015-10-27T17:51:45 <kasparnet> it should work again
2015-10-27T17:51:59 <kasparnet> sorry
2015-10-27T17:52:05 <kasparnet> to \'configuration\'
2015-10-27T17:52:05 <Bosmon> kasparnet - if only we had the VISUAL GPII SOLUTIONS BUILDING IDE :)
2015-10-27T17:52:14 <colinclark> Justin_o: Imagine you\'re developing a feature in Infusion that you need in the First Discovery Server
2015-10-27T17:52:15 * michelled has quit
2015-10-27T17:52:24 <colinclark> how do you reliably test this?
2015-10-27T17:52:33 <colinclark> In a traditional local workflow, you\'d do one of two things
2015-10-27T17:52:35 <slim_> kasparnet: ah - internal references - groovy
2015-10-27T17:52:36 <colinclark> 1. Use npm link
2015-10-27T17:52:38 <Justin_o> colinclark: which is sort of what cindyli ran into
2015-10-27T17:52:49 <colinclark> or 2. run npm install ../infusion or whatever like a cave person
2015-10-27T17:52:51 <colinclark> as I often do
2015-10-27T17:53:17 <colinclark> We need a solution to this use case that doesn\'t expose us as much to the kind of errors that you, Bosmon, and I have both experienced just in the last 72 hours
2015-10-27T17:53:22 <colinclark> which suggests that it\'s a universe use case
2015-10-27T17:53:28 <alanharnum> Justin_o: quick consult before i go down a slightly involved refactoring of the chartAuthoring tests?
2015-10-27T17:53:41 <Justin_o> alanharnum: sure
2015-10-27T17:53:54 <slim_> kasparnet: wh000t my breakpoint in VisualStudio got hit
2015-10-27T17:54:03 <kasparnet> :D
2015-10-27T17:54:04 <slim_> now I can finish the code...
2015-10-27T17:54:06 <Bosmon> slim_ - fist bump :)
2015-10-27T17:54:15 <slim_> while you figure the rest
2015-10-27T17:54:26 <slim_> Bosmon: indeed!
2015-10-27T17:54:31 <slim_> high 5 too
2015-10-27T17:54:41 <Bosmon> And while you quickly write the O\'Reilly guide to implementing and testing a new settings handler :)
2015-10-27T17:54:59 <kasparnet> :D
2015-10-27T17:55:53 <slim_> Bosmon: I might just do that or at least a webcast :)
2015-10-27T17:56:00 <Bosmon> slim_ - awesome :)
2015-10-27T17:56:10 <slim_> just watch one on docker and he was not that good
2015-10-27T17:58:57 <Bosmon> Oh slim_ guess what
2015-10-27T17:58:58 <Bosmon> https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/325
2015-10-27T17:59:06 <Bosmon> I found this ancient pull request of sgithens
2015-10-27T17:59:33 <Bosmon> Still waiting after 8 months for him to respond to his review comments :)
2015-10-27T17:59:50 <slim_> dam - that would have saved me a couple of days
2015-10-27T17:59:51 <Bosmon> But I think the info in it will  be useful to you
2015-10-27T18:00:00 <colinclark> Many of the review comments look pretty straightforward to address
2015-10-27T18:00:06 <Bosmon> You can feel free to fork it and take it on
2015-10-27T18:00:09 <colinclark> sounds like a good one, slim ;)
2015-10-27T18:00:19 <slim_> too much pressure :)
2015-10-27T18:00:21 <Bosmon> And perhaps add some more sections about your experiences with a new settings handler
2015-10-27T18:00:51 <slim_> trying to figure why my impl function isnt be called by invokeSettings handler
2015-10-27T18:01:01 <slim_> Ok I\'ll add to my todos
2015-10-27T18:01:23 <slim_> todo - jiras :)
2015-10-27T18:01:25 <Bosmon> slim_ - you are still referring to a nonexistent function "windows.displaySettingsHandler.getImpl"
2015-10-27T18:01:35 <slim_> no I fixed that
2015-10-27T18:01:45 <slim_> but thanks
2015-10-27T18:01:47 <Bosmon> See your own review comments :)
2015-10-27T18:02:01 <slim_> oooh promises :)
2015-10-27T18:02:29 <Bosmon> A standard function is also fine
2015-10-27T18:02:40 <Bosmon> You\'ll see the registrySettingsHandler is simple and synchronous
2015-10-27T18:02:53 <Bosmon> But there may be an issue with the payload structure
2015-10-27T18:14:56 * danayo joined the channel
2015-10-27T18:17:47 * slim__ has quit
2015-10-27T18:19:35 * kasparnet has quit
2015-10-27T18:20:38 <slim_> Bosman looks like you are correct about payload - screen-resolution is a minor pain as not valid idenitifer
2015-10-27T18:20:55 <slim_> what is the standard? sme are camel case, some pascal case
2015-10-27T18:21:07 <slim_> or don\'t we care
2015-10-27T18:32:49 * alanharnum has quit
2015-10-27T18:36:23 * alanharnum joined the channel
2015-10-27T18:45:29 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay, finally got back to a state where i can test the initial issue i was having with node-jqunit being missing
2015-10-27T18:45:53 <Justin_o> Bosmon: it\'s coming from KettleTestUtils.http.js i believe
2015-10-27T18:46:30 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes well, the package is indeed required
2015-10-27T18:46:36 <Bosmon> I\'m just wondering why this ever seemed to work before
2015-10-27T18:46:44 <Bosmon> Given it has only ever been a dev dependency of KEttle
2015-10-27T18:47:00 <danayo> colinclark: from Mindstorms: "I am suspicious of thinking about problems too abstractly...You can\'t think seriously about thinking without thinking about thinking about something"
2015-10-27T18:47:03 <Justin_o> Bosmon: maybe all the other packages also had used node-jqunit themselves
2015-10-27T18:47:04 * simonjb joined the channel
2015-10-27T18:47:13 <Bosmon> Justin_o - sure, but what about the package that was YOU
2015-10-27T18:47:37 <Justin_o> Bosmon: did the version i was using before include this file
2015-10-27T18:47:58 <Bosmon> Justin_o - the dependency structure was just the same - I just split one file into three
2015-10-27T18:48:00 <Justin_o> Bosmon: or did you make changes to your npmignore recently to bring in the test utils
2015-10-27T18:48:06 <Bosmon> npmignore?
2015-10-27T18:48:19 <Justin_o> the thing that keeps files out of your npm package
2015-10-27T18:48:27 <colinclark> danayo: That\'s an awesome quote
2015-10-27T18:48:36 <danayo> isn\'t it???
2015-10-27T18:48:41 <danayo> totally
2015-10-27T18:48:43 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I don\'t have one
2015-10-27T18:48:47 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i would have thought this would have been an issue if you put three files into one
2015-10-27T18:48:54 <Justin_o> as it should have come up before
2015-10-27T18:48:59 <Justin_o> very strange
2015-10-27T18:49:01 * kasparnet joined the channel
2015-10-27T18:49:47 <Justin_o> Bosmon: what does this actually do fluid.require("node-jqunit", require, "jqUnit");
2015-10-27T18:49:49 <kasparnet> sorry slim_ -- food got in the way
2015-10-27T18:49:51 <kasparnet> I\'m back
2015-10-27T18:49:53 <kasparnet> now*
2015-10-27T18:50:48 <Bosmon> Justin_o - you can check out our awesome new docs : P
2015-10-27T18:50:49 <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/pull/77/files#diff-d7540666721f8644efd29f0d5fb29613R73
2015-10-27T18:51:17 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I guess the issue is the dependencies of first-discovery-server itself
2015-10-27T18:51:33 <Bosmon> This worked before because the "old" jqUnit was a dev dependency of first-discovery-server
2015-10-27T18:51:36 <Bosmon> And so it was installed at that level
2015-10-27T18:51:48 <Bosmon> The "new" jqUnit has a different package name and so the old can\'t substitute for the new
2015-10-27T18:51:57 <Bosmon> https://github.com/GPII/first-discovery-server/blob/master/package.json#L37
2015-10-27T18:52:07 <Bosmon> NOW we understand how this worked before......
2015-10-27T18:52:38 <Justin_o> Bosmon: this is the file in the version of kettle i was using https://github.com/amb26/kettle/blob/33e2826e78315c6d29b13c8ba810f54fef29e8ac/lib/test/KettleTestUtils.js i don\'t see node-jqunit there
2015-10-27T18:53:46 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, indeed - that is old
2015-10-27T18:53:47 <Bosmon> And this is new
2015-10-27T18:54:09 <Justin_o> Bosmon: but that would explain why i didn\'t have the issue before.. as i was using the old one
'

b'2015-10-27T17:09:02 <Justin_o> upstream is a typical convention
2015-10-27T17:09:11 <Bosmon> I\'ve seen it used, yes
2015-10-27T17:09:17 <Justin_o> but i see your point that it may not always be there
2015-10-27T17:09:25 <cindyli> kasparnet: is that correct? so the transformation is not happening
2015-10-27T17:09:54 <Justin_o> Bosmon: it\'s an interesting issue as you may just push from a checkout off of fluid-prjoect/infusion where the upstream may in fact be origin
2015-10-27T17:10:08 <Justin_o> i\'m not really sure how to handle this in a general way though
2015-10-27T17:10:20 <Bosmon> Justin_o - well, documentation for a start : P
2015-10-27T17:10:25 <Justin_o> Bosmon: as all the various setups may be differnt
2015-10-27T17:10:28 <Bosmon> And some better failure messages
2015-10-27T17:10:29 <Justin_o> sure documentation would help :)
2015-10-27T17:10:33 <Justin_o> ah
2015-10-27T17:10:37 <Justin_o> what did you get as an error
2015-10-27T17:10:39 <Justin_o> ?
2015-10-27T17:11:14 <Bosmon> $ node publish.js --standard
2015-10-27T17:11:14 <Bosmon> fatal: \'upstream\' does not appear to be a git repository
2015-10-27T17:11:14 <Bosmon> fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
2015-10-27T17:11:14 <Bosmon> Please make sure you have the correct access rights
2015-10-27T17:11:14 <Bosmon> and the repository exists.
2015-10-27T17:11:15 <Bosmon> child_process.js:484
2015-10-27T17:11:15 <Bosmon> throw err;
2015-10-27T17:11:36 <Justin_o> Bosmon: that error is a lot better than i expected :)
2015-10-27T17:11:46 <Bosmon> It could be worse :)
2015-10-27T17:12:00 <Bosmon> Having the shell commands echoed to the console would make it somewhat better
2015-10-27T17:12:10 <Justin_o> aren\'t they in the console?
2015-10-27T17:12:13 <Bosmon> They aren\'t
2015-10-27T17:12:16 <Justin_o> oh sorry, the commands
2015-10-27T17:12:21 <Justin_o> yah, that\'s a good point
2015-10-27T17:12:29 <Justin_o> i only do that for the tests right now
2015-10-27T17:12:38 <Justin_o> isTest that is
2015-10-27T17:13:38 <Justin_o> Bosmon: could you file a JIRA(s) for that, i\'ll take a look at it when i get a chance. It should be a fairly straight forward change
2015-10-27T17:13:52 <alanharnum> Justin_o: quick question about the Infusion testing framework...
2015-10-27T17:13:53 <Justin_o> well, maybe not.. maybe i\'ll put a wrapper around execSync which would be a bit more work
2015-10-27T17:13:58 <Justin_o> alanharnum: sure
2015-10-27T17:14:16 <alanharnum> new equivalent of jqUnit.exists is jqUnit.assertNodeExists?
2015-10-27T17:14:31 <Bosmon> alanharnum - yes
2015-10-27T17:14:34 <alanharnum> cool thx
2015-10-27T17:14:36 <Bosmon> Check my docs pull for updates
2015-10-27T17:15:36 <slim_> Bosmon: hi - I can\'t figure anything out looking at all the other examples
2015-10-27T17:15:42 <kasparnet> cindyli: when saving to the server, we will always save in the format that you send the preferences in
2015-10-27T17:15:42 <kasparnet> (in your case in the "first-discovery" ontology)
2015-10-27T17:16:04 <slim_> kasparnet: yo uwere trying to get me on skype?
2015-10-27T17:16:08 <cindyli> ah ok. seems i misunderstood the ontology
2015-10-27T17:16:18 <kasparnet> and the reason for this is that we risk loosing precision when transforming values
2015-10-27T17:16:19 <Justin_o> Bosmon: by the way, my vagrant vm is failing on npm install now.. i think regarding dedupe again :( maybe from kettle?
2015-10-27T17:16:48 <cindyli> kasparnet: when the ontology data file is used then?
2015-10-27T17:16:57 <cindyli> to apply prefs to OS?
2015-10-27T17:17:10 <Justin_o> Bosmon: well, maybe it\'s gpii-express that\'s causing it :(
2015-10-27T17:17:11 <kasparnet> the ontologization is used to ensure that you\'re not overwriting any similar preferences in the NP
2015-10-27T17:17:28 <kasparnet> and if you want to retrieve preferences in a different ontology than the one it\'s saved in
2015-10-27T17:18:22 <kasparnet> so now, once they\'re saved, you should be able to do:
2015-10-27T17:18:48 <kasparnet> GET localhost:8081/preferences/b7eebaee-7df5-40ff-9fda-27e37d1d7cb7?view=flat
2015-10-27T17:19:04 <kasparnet> and that should get you the prefs in the "flat" ontology
2015-10-27T17:19:15 <cindyli> sorry, kasparnet, what is NP
2015-10-27T17:19:31 <kasparnet> sorry - "Needs and Preferences set"
2015-10-27T17:19:49 <cindyli> ah. thanks
2015-10-27T17:21:45 <kasparnet> cindyli: did the get request work?
2015-10-27T17:21:58 <kasparnet> did you get the preferences back in the flat format, .. or?
2015-10-27T17:22:18 <kasparnet> (e.g. if you just do a "curl localhost:8081/preferences/b7eebaee-7df5-40ff-9fda-27e37d1d7cb7?view=flat")
2015-10-27T17:23:06 <cindyli> kasparnet: i\'m using postman, a chrome plugin. this request gets me
2015-10-27T17:23:07 <cindyli> {
2015-10-27T17:23:07 <cindyli> "contexts": {}
2015-10-27T17:23:07 <cindyli> }
2015-10-27T17:23:12 <kasparnet> crap
2015-10-27T17:23:17 <kasparnet> :)
2015-10-27T17:23:23 <cindyli> but i do see the server console log outputs
2015-10-27T17:23:28 <cindyli> 13:22:19.582:  Raw preferences fetched by PreferencesServer: {
2015-10-27T17:23:28 <cindyli> "first-discovery": {
2015-10-27T17:23:28 <cindyli> "gpii_firstDiscovery_language": "\\"en-US\\""
2015-10-27T17:23:28 <cindyli> }
2015-10-27T17:23:28 <cindyli> }
2015-10-27T17:23:52 <cindyli> trying curl commands
2015-10-27T17:24:34 <slim_> Bosmon: ping
2015-10-27T17:24:52 <kasparnet> cindyli: well - I dont think it\'s postman -- I think it\'s the framework :)
2015-10-27T17:24:58 <alanharnum> Bosmon: another question - since the assertEquals function is now doing strict equality checking, what is the expected/best pattern for equivalency testing that the string "123" is equal to the integer 123? Make use of assertCanoniseEqual?
2015-10-27T17:25:21 <kasparnet> slim_: sorry for not pinging you back
2015-10-27T17:25:24 <cindyli> you were right, the curl command returns the same
2015-10-27T17:25:25 <cindyli> {
2015-10-27T17:25:26 <cindyli> "contexts": {}
2015-10-27T17:25:26 <cindyli> }
2015-10-27T17:25:30 <Bosmon> slim__ - hi there
2015-10-27T17:25:31 <kasparnet> (am in a meeting - bosmon likewise)
2015-10-27T17:25:40 <Bosmon> alanharnum - best practice is to do the type conversion explicitly and then use assertEquals
2015-10-27T17:25:44 <kasparnet> slim_: I wanted to check in on you with the screen resolution
2015-10-27T17:25:48 <slim_> Bosmon: soz, didn\'t know in meeting
2015-10-27T17:26:12 <alanharnum> Bosmon: OK, that was my initial thought, wanted to make sure there wasn\'t something built-in I should be using
2015-10-27T17:26:22 <slim_> kasparnet:  I waiting for Bosman to help me glue the code up with prefs :)
2015-10-27T17:26:26 <Bosmon> E.g. String(123) etc.
2015-10-27T17:26:34 <kasparnet> cindyli: I\'m wondering if the system is screwy due to the dash in first disovery
2015-10-27T17:26:51 <slim_> I\'m lost in the transforms etc and although I think it\'s all set up my get/set functions are not being called
2015-10-27T17:27:00 <slim_> once I get that working I\'m almost there
2015-10-27T17:27:07 <Bosmon> slim_ - are your branches in github up to date?
2015-10-27T17:27:10 <Bosmon> I\'ll take another look
2015-10-27T17:27:14 <slim_> Bosmon: yes
2015-10-27T17:27:31 <Bosmon> Justin_o - JIRA is already assigned
2015-10-27T17:27:36 <slim_> you mentioned screen-resolution not be inused but I see escatly the same with mouse trailing
2015-10-27T17:27:50 <slim_> I can\'t see the significance of that scree-resolution
2015-10-27T17:28:07 <slim_> Bos thanks
2015-10-27T17:28:23 <kasparnet> cindyli: so perhaps renaming the ontology transform to "firstOntology-flat.json"
2015-10-27T17:28:45 <kasparnet> and uploading with http://localhost:8081/preferences/?view=firstDiscovery
2015-10-27T17:28:47 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks
2015-10-27T17:29:06 <cindyli> trying that, kasparnet. now with the new knowledge of what ontology is used for, i wonder if i still need it defined for the first discovery tool
2015-10-27T17:29:17 <Bosmon> slim_ - oh yes, I need to remind myself of this stuff too
2015-10-27T17:29:22 <Bosmon> kasparnet is the real expert here : P
2015-10-27T17:29:26 <Bosmon> What a busy day in the channel today
2015-10-27T17:29:36 <slim_> kasparnet: over to you - seeing there are no docs :)
2015-10-27T17:29:51 <slim_> rush hour?
2015-10-27T17:30:12 <kasparnet> cindyli: it depends -- you need it if you want the preferences to be used by the rest of the GPII (which are expecting preferences in the flat format)
2015-10-27T17:30:34 <kasparnet> or if you want to use some of the NP sets that are defined in other ontologies in the first discovery tool
2015-10-27T17:30:37 <slim_> kasparnet: there is somehting wrong here - https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/280/files
2015-10-27T17:30:39 <Justin_o> alanharnum: at standup you were mentioning that i could update something related to vagrant and ansible
2015-10-27T17:30:45 <Justin_o> what was it that i needed to do?
2015-10-27T17:30:49 * kasparnet is looking
2015-10-27T17:30:53 <kasparnet> slim_: ^
2015-10-27T17:31:01 <slim_> kasparnet: \\0/
2015-10-27T17:31:06 <alanharnum> Justin_o: actually, thinking about it, you shouldn\'t have to do anything - it will happen automatically with a \'vagrant provision\'
2015-10-27T17:31:29 * alanharnum was referring to the Ansible nodejs role, which gets pulled in automatically
2015-10-27T17:31:49 <slim_> kasparnet: ignore dispres1024x768.json  i\'m using sammyRes to test
2015-10-27T17:31:56 <Bosmon> I\'m actually equally puzzled by jhernand1z screen res pull for linux, which presumably actually works
2015-10-27T17:32:21 <kasparnet> slim_: so I think the easiest way to go about this is to use an NP set with application specific settings first
2015-10-27T17:32:39 <kasparnet> slim_: to make sure that the settingshandler portion of things is working
2015-10-27T17:32:54 <slim_> can we do that for this? javi mentioned that but I thought he ment try Maavis or other solution
2015-10-27T17:32:58 <kasparnet> slim_: then once we think that\'s good, we can do the common term and transformations stuff
2015-10-27T17:33:04 <kasparnet> ah ok... sec
2015-10-27T17:33:21 <slim_> so how do I do that for screen res which I thought was supporting common terms only?
2015-10-27T17:33:25 <kasparnet> so - what does your "displaySettingsHandler" need as input
2015-10-27T17:33:35 <kasparnet> what does it expect?
2015-10-27T17:33:38 <Bosmon> Thanks kasparnet
2015-10-27T17:33:50 <slim_> {width:xxx, height:zzz}
2015-10-27T17:33:54 <kasparnet> ok cool
2015-10-27T17:34:00 <slim_> Bosmon: thanks for all your help so far
2015-10-27T17:34:35 <slim_> although it\'s called displaySettings - it only handles screenRes for now
2015-10-27T17:34:46 <slim_> though it could be expanded, eg dpi
2015-10-27T17:34:56 <Justin_o> alanharnum: okay, thanks.. although i\'m noticing now that i have issues with the infusion dedupe again that hadn\'t been happening for a while. I\'m not sure how started happening again though
2015-10-27T17:35:05 <slim_> I planned to set a breakpoint and figure out what payload I get :)
2015-10-27T17:35:15 * danayo has quit
2015-10-27T17:35:30 <slim_> kasparnet: ^^^^
2015-10-27T17:35:36 <Bosmon> Justin_o - it may be that you ran into the same problem I did when I was testing for avtar
2015-10-27T17:35:52 <Bosmon> It\'s very easy to forget that you may have caused "infusion pollution" YOURSELF in your own working copy
2015-10-27T17:36:04 <alanharnum> Justin_o: I don\'t think anything in the PR should affect npm install in any way - the PR only deals with systemd
2015-10-27T17:36:09 <Bosmon> So the issue is that avtar\'s scripts, when they copy back to the shared area, cannot account for the REMOVAL of files
2015-10-27T17:36:29 <Bosmon> So if you have duplicate infusions in the shared folder, they will not be removed by the dedupe task within the vm
2015-10-27T17:36:36 <Bosmon> this puzzled us for quite a while
2015-10-27T17:36:39 <Justin_o> Bosmon: oh intersting, so i have to delete the node_modules in my host director?
2015-10-27T17:36:43 <slim_> kasparnet:  FYI the code - https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/65/files
2015-10-27T17:36:55 <Bosmon> Justin_o - if you have run npm install in the host directory, you will ALSO need to run dedupe in the host directory, yes
2015-10-27T17:37:01 <Bosmon> And it\'s a very easy thing to do by accident
2015-10-27T17:37:38 <Bosmon> I had THOUGHT that this wasn\'t a reasonable workflow for dev, but colinclark reminded me that many people actually plan to use the vagrant setup as a dev environment
2015-10-27T17:37:54 <Bosmon> So its something we may want to do something explicit about, if this really is the problem you have run into
2015-10-27T17:37:59 <kasparnet> slim_: https://gist.github.com/kaspermarkus/8a0171cd8d1da345798a
2015-10-27T17:38:03 <slim_> vagrent? I want docker!
'

b'2015-10-27T15:36:23 <Bosmon> You have actually named it windows.display.getImpl
2015-10-27T15:36:33 <slim_> true - I justy change to windows tty which is restricted compared to MSYS default
2015-10-27T15:36:37 <Bosmon> Also you have a filename case error in your index.js
2015-10-27T15:36:44 <Bosmon> require("./gpii/node_modules/displaySettingshandler");
2015-10-27T15:37:17 <Bosmon> Also you\'re referring to a nonexistent global on this line: https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/65/files#diff-7cda3c3e57bc6f9cc86e3620c9d96931R183
2015-10-27T15:37:31 <Bosmon> With problems this blatant its a little worrying that you aren\'t seeing any error output :)
2015-10-27T15:38:04 <Bosmon> Always make sure you run the linting task before you try any tests...
2015-10-27T15:38:07 <slim_> ah - thats oK I put breakpoint on line 195 and 199 just to get somehting known
2015-10-27T15:38:17 <Bosmon> ok
2015-10-27T15:38:49 <Bosmon> So what does your solutions entry look like
2015-10-27T15:39:00 <slim_> re - index error - interesting - it still threw up parse errors - must be case insensitive on windows?
2015-10-27T15:39:06 <slim_> good spot though
2015-10-27T15:39:41 <slim_> re non existent global - that\'s not a single line link
2015-10-27T15:40:10 <slim_> re linting - what is the in grunt?
2015-10-27T15:40:19 <Bosmon> slim_ - it is at this end
2015-10-27T15:40:24 <Bosmon> Link to line 183 of that file
2015-10-27T15:40:28 <Bosmon> slim_ - run "grunt lint"
2015-10-27T15:40:31 <slim_> does it include jsonlint too - I spent agges on solutions typ0
2015-10-27T15:40:35 * anastasiac has quit
2015-10-27T15:40:37 <Bosmon> Yes
2015-10-27T15:40:44 <Bosmon> Both jshint and jsonlint
2015-10-27T15:40:52 <slim_> great!
2015-10-27T15:40:54 <Bosmon> Always run them before you try anything : P
2015-10-27T15:41:02 <slim_> will do now - in windows?
2015-10-27T15:41:13 <Bosmon> In every project
2015-10-27T15:41:25 <Bosmon> Standard task across all our repos
2015-10-27T15:42:35 <slim_> thanks - any more I should know. didn\'t read about that
2015-10-27T15:42:49 <Bosmon> It\'s hard to know what there is to know : P
2015-10-27T15:42:59 <Bosmon> One only discovers this through the process of discovering what people don\'t know : P
2015-10-27T15:43:30 <slim_> hehe
2015-10-27T15:43:49 <slim_> just do  a full brain dump
2015-10-27T15:44:42 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2015-10-27T15:44:45 * alanharnum joined the channel
2015-10-27T15:44:49 * anastasiac joined the channel
2015-10-27T15:50:14 <Bosmon> Justin_o - merged in your fluid-publish branch... but now noticed that there is an odd issue with the --standard workflow
2015-10-27T15:50:21 <Bosmon> It seems to assume that there is a remote repo named "upstream"
2015-10-27T15:51:54 <Bosmon> This seems to be a kind of half-regular convention, but not something one could always depend on
2015-10-27T15:52:41 <Bosmon> It should at least be explained clearly as a requirement in the docs, and I think we should also do something to help the user ensure it is the case
2015-10-27T15:53:07 <Bosmon> For example to create a standard task for the plugin which can add the "upstream" as a copy of one of the existing remotes
2015-10-27T15:53:20 <Bosmon> For myself, my "upstream" is always just named "master"
2015-10-27T15:55:57 * jhung joined the channel
2015-10-27T15:59:48 <slim_> Bosmon: so have linted and pushed.
2015-10-27T16:00:11 <slim_> login in out reported as successful in browser but my get/set never called
2015-10-27T16:00:33 <slim_> console just shows a massive datadump - looks like the solutions file contents
2015-10-27T16:00:54 <Bosmon> slim_ - so yes, what does your solutions entry look like, which you are expecting the user to log in from
2015-10-27T16:00:57 <slim_> my guess is somehting in solution entry doesn\'t match up
2015-10-27T16:01:01 <Bosmon> That is, both your prefs entry and your solutions entry
2015-10-27T16:01:07 <Bosmon> Do you have a matching branch of universal?
2015-10-27T16:01:15 <Bosmon> May as well issue a pull request for that too
2015-10-27T16:01:29 <Bosmon> Then you can crosslink them in the pull request comments so that someone trying to follow can reproduce
2015-10-27T16:01:30 <slim_> yess I did PR in universal to match
2015-10-27T16:01:34 <Bosmon> ok
2015-10-27T16:01:41 <slim_> https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/280/files
2015-10-27T16:01:56 <slim_> and I corssed linked :)
2015-10-27T16:02:01 <Bosmon> awesome
2015-10-27T16:02:33 <slim_> I used com.microsoft.windows.screenResolution" and gpii.windows.displaySettingsHandler
2015-10-27T16:02:49 <slim_> the namespace for code is gpii.windows.displaySettingsHandler
2015-10-27T16:03:43 <Bosmon> slim_ - yes, looks like the issue is your transformation
2015-10-27T16:03:51 <Bosmon> It claims a target path of "screen-resolution"
2015-10-27T16:04:09 <Bosmon> Which isn\'t anything recognised by the prefs set
2015-10-27T16:04:10 * michelled has quit
2015-10-27T16:04:25 <Bosmon> Unfortunately I have to go into a meeting now, but perhaps you can piece this together by looking at other solutions entries :)
2015-10-27T16:05:18 <slim_> what prefs set? I coppied that from jhernand1z
2015-10-27T16:05:32 <slim_> ok, thanks
2015-10-27T16:06:08 <slim_> ah - I think I get it
2015-10-27T16:26:42 * michelled joined the channel
2015-10-27T16:36:39 <cindyli> kasparnet: i added an ontology data file to transform preferences sets sent from the first discovery tool - https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/GPII-1309/testData/ontologies/first-discovery-flat.json, a couple of questions:
2015-10-27T16:36:44 <cindyli> 1. does it look good?
2015-10-27T16:36:56 <cindyli> 2. how to hook up it for the transformation?
2015-10-27T16:37:53 <cindyli> i tried to post preferences to http://localhost:8081/preferences/?view=first-discovery-flat but the transformation didn\'t happen. what do i need to do to hook up this data mapping?
2015-10-27T16:38:29 <cindyli> my post data: { "gpii_firstDiscovery_language": "en-US" }
2015-10-27T16:38:40 <cindyli> the response from the prefs server:
2015-10-27T16:38:41 <cindyli> {
2015-10-27T16:38:41 <cindyli> "userToken": "529e7cbb-cb95-49d9-9d71-f08fa4a321b9",
2015-10-27T16:38:42 <cindyli> "preferences": {
2015-10-27T16:38:42 <cindyli> "gpii_firstDiscovery_language": "\\"en-US\\""
2015-10-27T16:38:42 <cindyli> }
2015-10-27T16:38:42 <cindyli> }
2015-10-27T16:40:41 * sepidehshahi has quit
2015-10-27T16:41:58 <cindyli> Bosmon: can you help me with those questions? ^
2015-10-27T16:42:06 <Bosmon> cindyli - "first-discovery-flat" is not an ontology in itself
2015-10-27T16:42:15 <Bosmon> cindyli - kasparnet and I are in a meeting right now but I can give you some hints
2015-10-27T16:42:22 <cindyli> thanks
2015-10-27T16:42:28 <Bosmon> Remember that the ontology transforms are between PAIRS of ontologies
2015-10-27T16:42:48 <Bosmon> WHereas a particular prefs set is posted in a PARTICULAR ontology
2015-10-27T16:43:01 <Bosmon> You can trace the control of flow through from here: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/preferencesServer/src/preferencesPostHandler.js#L55
2015-10-27T16:43:40 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2015-10-27T16:43:42 <Bosmon> Eventually passes through here: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/ontologyHandler/src/ontologyHandler.js#L253
2015-10-27T16:47:05 <kasparnet> cindyli: (1) yes, that looks correct (2) if this question is about how to actually use transformatsion (i.e. \'transform\') there is an (admittedly bad) example here: https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/GPII-1309/testData/ontologies/ISO24751-flat.json#L51-L57
2015-10-27T16:47:41 <kasparnet> so you that JSON file is basically just one big transformation sepc
2015-10-27T16:49:40 <cindyli> ok, kasparnet, seems my data file is missing "transform" section. is it correct to use the data file name as the value of the "view" parameter in the post request?
2015-10-27T16:50:33 <cindyli> for example, the data file is named "first-discovery-flat.json", so the request looks like /preferences/?view=first-discovery-flat
2015-10-27T16:54:21 <slim_> Bosmon: are you still in a meeting? I\'m still stuck!
2015-10-27T16:55:37 <cindyli> kasparnet, Bosmon: another question is, is there a default path mapping transform used when the "transform" section is not specified? such as "privacy-flat.json" doesn\'t have a "transform" section defined - https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/GPII-1309/testData/ontologies/privacy-flat.json
2015-10-27T16:56:04 <cindyli> meantime, trying more with these existing ontology files
2015-10-27T16:56:47 * sepidehshahi has quit
2015-10-27T16:57:04 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2015-10-27T16:57:18 <slim_> Bosmon: no i\'m not :)
2015-10-27T16:58:15 <kasparnet> cindyli: so I realized I misread your first question
2015-10-27T16:58:47 <kasparnet> so, there is an implicit transform wrapping each of these ontology mapping files
2015-10-27T16:59:14 <kasparnet> so you can interpret it as being the content of a "transform": {  ... }
2015-10-27T16:59:41 <kasparnet> do you have a link to the preference set that you\'re using?
2015-10-27T17:00:08 <cindyli> kasparnet: it looks like
2015-10-27T17:00:09 <cindyli> {
2015-10-27T17:00:09 <cindyli> \t"gpii_firstDiscovery_language":"en-US",
2015-10-27T17:00:09 <cindyli> \t"gpii_firstDiscovery_speak":true,
2015-10-27T17:00:09 <cindyli> \t"gpii_firstDiscovery_speechRate":1,
2015-10-27T17:00:09 <cindyli> \t"fluid_prefs_contrast":"default",

2015-10-27T17:00:10 <cindyli> \t"gpii_firstDiscovery_onScreenKeyboard":true,
2015-10-27T17:00:10 <cindyli> \t"gpii_firstDiscovery_captions":true,

2015-10-27T17:00:12 <cindyli> }
2015-10-27T17:00:49 <cindyli> i mean the preference set sent by the client, which is the first discovery tool
2015-10-27T17:02:46 <kasparnet> so your POST query should be to: http://localhost:8081/preferences/?view=first-discovery
2015-10-27T17:03:06 <cindyli> ok
2015-10-27T17:03:14 <kasparnet> which tells the server that it\'s in the "first-discovery" ontology
2015-10-27T17:03:54 * alanharnum has quit
2015-10-27T17:03:57 <kasparnet> are you using the remote prefs server, or a local system in development mode?
2015-10-27T17:04:13 <cindyli> kasparnet: a local system in development mode
2015-10-27T17:04:37 <kasparnet> ok - then you should be able to see the saved NP set under node_modules/universal/testData/preferences
2015-10-27T17:04:43 <cindyli> kasparnet: so the server looks up the ontology data file by adding suffix "-flat.json" to the specified ontology?
2015-10-27T17:04:49 <kasparnet> it will have the userToken as name
2015-10-27T17:06:16 <cindyli> kasparnet: i sent a post request to http://localhost:8081/preferences/?view=first-discovery
2015-10-27T17:06:46 <cindyli> with this data: {
2015-10-27T17:06:46 <cindyli> "gpii_firstDiscovery_language": "en-US"
2015-10-27T17:06:46 <cindyli> }
2015-10-27T17:06:58 <cindyli> the response from the prefs server:
2015-10-27T17:06:59 <cindyli> {
2015-10-27T17:06:59 <cindyli> "userToken": "b7eebaee-7df5-40ff-9fda-27e37d1d7cb7",

2015-10-27T17:06:59 <cindyli> }

'

b'2015-10-27T14:28:29 <Bosmon> You can see it in here
2015-10-27T14:29:02 <slim_> Bosmon: tah
2015-10-27T14:29:26 <Bosmon> Here\'s the bit on "defaults"
2015-10-27T14:29:26 <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/pull/77/files#diff-862eaf745e4662a3578248540964bbc5R616
2015-10-27T14:29:31 <slim_> groovy
2015-10-27T14:29:33 <Bosmon> Although this mainly talks about component defaults
2015-10-27T14:29:49 <Bosmon> I realise I need to write a little more, as anastasiac has just pointed out, on the use of fluid.defaults for functions
2015-10-27T14:30:18 <slim_> ok - so I can\'t avoid a bit of genning up on fluid after all!
2015-10-27T14:30:24 <slim_> thanks
2015-10-27T14:30:59 <Bosmon> But the two-sentence summary is - "i) fluid.defaults stores and retrieves blocks of JSON, and ii) by writing names in "gradeNames", the blocks are merged against parent blocks"
2015-10-27T14:31:22 <Bosmon> It\'s really a pretty simple system, as far as it goes
2015-10-27T14:32:00 <Bosmon> You can think of it as a way of storing metadata about implementations
2015-10-27T14:32:14 <Bosmon> Whether that implementation is just a simple function, or whether there is a "component" there
2015-10-27T14:33:04 <Bosmon> For functions, most of our use of it is just a simple way of being able to call functions with named arguments - as well as, sometimes, being able to tell whether a function meets some contract or other
2015-10-27T14:33:21 <Bosmon> As you know, we don\'t have TYPES in JavaScript...... what we have, is JSON :)
2015-10-27T14:33:54 <Bosmon> Subject to a few basics, you can essentially store whatever JSON you like in there
2015-10-27T14:34:24 <slim_> hmm - I think I get it
2015-10-27T14:34:26 <Bosmon> Although to be useful, someone would have to have some expectation of being able to understand what it says :)
2015-10-27T14:34:30 <slim_> so grades no namespaces
2015-10-27T14:34:43 <Bosmon> Well a grade\'s name agrees with a namespace name
2015-10-27T14:34:53 <Bosmon> Since the idea is that the name of the grade agrees with the name of the thing it is describing
2015-10-27T14:34:55 <slim_> ooooooookaaaaaayyy
2015-10-27T14:35:04 <Bosmon> If you have a function named gpii.myThing
2015-10-27T14:35:18 <Bosmon> You will describe it by issuing fluid.defaults("gpii.myThing", {about my thing})
2015-10-27T14:35:29 <Bosmon> Whatever you might like to say about your thing to describe it : P
2015-10-27T14:36:04 <Bosmon> Although if your thing is a COMPONENT, the thing you are describing is something that the framework now constructs automatically - that is, the component\'s creator function
2015-10-27T14:36:11 <slim_> so .defaults === .attachMetaData in most uses?
2015-10-27T14:36:12 <Bosmon> But in the old days we used to write these functions by hand
2015-10-27T14:36:18 <Bosmon> slim_ - right
2015-10-27T14:36:46 <Bosmon> In the "modern" framework, the metadata is 100% of what the framework needs to implement the component\'s creator function
2015-10-27T14:36:50 <slim_> and so effectively optional in settings handlers?
2015-10-27T14:36:51 * anvk joined the channel
2015-10-27T14:36:57 <slim_> ah
2015-10-27T14:36:59 <Bosmon> But if the thing is just a function, you write it yourself
2015-10-27T14:37:34 <Bosmon> slim_ - there\'s no particular need for defaults in a settings handler, no - it\'s just a useful structuring device in the implementation
2015-10-27T14:37:35 <slim_> Bosmon: thanks for the enlightenment!
2015-10-27T14:37:47 <Bosmon> You\'ll notice that the registry settings handler doesn\'t use any
2015-10-27T14:37:50 <Bosmon> It\'s just a bunch of functions
2015-10-27T14:38:19 <slim_> I was thinking the side effects were important but couldn\'t figure them
2015-10-27T14:38:32 <Bosmon> The framework doesn\'t need TELLING that something is a settings handler, it\'s enough that it is one, is referenced from a solutions file, and passes its test cases
2015-10-27T14:38:37 <slim_> yes - that\'s one of the major diffs
2015-10-27T14:38:59 <anastasiac> Bosmon, fyi, I think I\xe2\x80\x99m about finished reviewing your monster infusion docs pull request. I\xe2\x80\x99ve left some comments.
2015-10-27T14:39:17 <slim_> anastasiac: rather you thank me :)
2015-10-27T14:39:18 <Bosmon> In theory we could make a "settings handler grade" one day - if we had an environment that wanted, say, to allow us to itemise "all the settings handlers in the system"
2015-10-27T14:39:22 * slim_ goes to lunch
2015-10-27T14:39:35 <Bosmon> anastasiac - thanks very much, I\'ll start working through them this afternoon
2015-10-27T14:39:53 <Bosmon> One day, for example, we will have a MARVELLOUS GPII IDE
2015-10-27T14:40:16 <Bosmon> THat will allow the user to construct a solutions registry entry....... using a ....... GUI!
2015-10-27T14:40:37 <anastasiac> and Bosmon, thanks for your review of the prefs framework tutorial. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to address those comments next

2015-10-27T14:48:25 <Justin_o> Bosmon: for the first discovery server, i\'ll need to make requests to the security server. It seems that other places make use of kettle dataSources, but i\'d prefer not to have a dependency on both kettle and gpii-express. Does that make sense? Also, what do you recommend that i use for making the request. I\'m thinking of writing my own dataSource and using
2015-10-27T14:48:25 <Justin_o> nodes http methods. Is there a better option?
2015-10-27T14:49:27 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I don\'t think it\'s a hazard to have a dependency on kettle and gpii-express - after all, gpii-express already depends on it for its test cases : P
2015-10-27T14:49:54 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes, but that\'s a dev dependency
2015-10-27T14:50:13 <Bosmon> My KETTLE-32 branch is quite stable now and should be going into review shortly - but by all means write your own dataSource if you feel more comfortable
2015-10-27T14:50:30 <Bosmon> https://github.com/amb26/kettle/tree/KETTLE-32
2015-10-27T14:51:17 <Justin_o> Bosmon: currently the first discovery server is pulling in this version of kettle for the tests. git://github.com/amb26/kettle.git#33e2826e78315c6d29b13c8ba810f54fef29e8ac
2015-10-27T14:51:24 <Justin_o> is that very far out of date from your branch?
2015-10-27T14:51:29 <Bosmon> Justin_o - not very far, no
2015-10-27T14:51:42 <Justin_o> Bosmon: should i update to your branch or keep using this version?
2015-10-27T14:52:05 <Bosmon> Justin_o - you should update to my branch - since it actually has... DOCUMENTATION : P
2015-10-27T14:52:11 <Justin_o> :)
2015-10-27T14:52:16 <simonjb> Bosmon: would you have some time to chat Hybrid Flow Manager?
2015-10-27T14:52:17 <Justin_o> that was going to be my next question
2015-10-27T14:52:30 <Bosmon> I\'d be grateful for any defect reports that you turned up - since this is the version that will be the basis for the GPII next month
2015-10-27T14:52:52 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay, i\'ll give it a try
2015-10-27T14:52:57 <Bosmon> Justin_o - the documentation is currently in "single giant README" form
2015-10-27T14:53:04 <Bosmon> But I guess we should move it over to our docs platform before long
2015-10-27T14:53:23 <Bosmon> I guess I should issue the pull request for it now
2015-10-27T14:53:31 <Bosmon> I was just waiting for there to be a stable version of Infusion to bind it to
2015-10-27T14:53:36 <Bosmon> simonjb - sure
2015-10-27T14:53:43 <simonjb> awesome Bosmon
2015-10-27T14:53:54 <Justin_o> Bosmon: you mean an Infusion 2.0.0 release?
2015-10-27T14:54:08 <simonjb> Bosmon: here, or vidyo?
2015-10-27T14:54:15 <Bosmon> Justin_o - or at least a dev release that reflected current trunk, yes - which I think is pretty much what we want to release
2015-10-27T14:54:25 <Bosmon> simonjb - vidyo is good, but just give me 5 mins
2015-10-27T14:54:45 <simonjb> Bosmon: yeah, of course, ping me when it\'s good
2015-10-27T14:54:57 <Justin_o> Bosmon: we\'re probably pretty close to that..
2015-10-27T14:56:02 <Justin_o> Bosmon: after my latest updates to fluid-publish get merged we should probably pull that into infusion and push up another dev release
2015-10-27T14:57:39 <Bosmon> Justin_o - awesome

2015-10-27T15:22:39 <colinclark> ok
2015-10-27T15:22:40 <colinclark> good
2015-10-27T15:24:08 * alanharnum joined the channel
2015-10-27T15:24:43 <Justin_o> colinclark: how high a priority is this, should I switch from the first discovery server work to fix the IE issue?
2015-10-27T15:25:22 <alanharnum> those in the IDRC office today, there are TimBits on the shared food area
2015-10-27T15:25:30 <alanharnum> for those in need of sugar
2015-10-27T15:25:43 <Justin_o> alanharnum: thanks :)
2015-10-27T15:26:51 <colinclark> Justin_o: No, don\'t switch off of the First Discovery Server work, Justin_o
2015-10-27T15:26:55 <colinclark> DOUBLE Justin_o
2015-10-27T15:27:02 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i\'m getting the following error when trying to run my tests with the KETTLE-32 branch FATAL ERROR: Uncaught exception: Cannot find module \'node-jqunit\'
2015-10-27T15:27:02 <Justin_o> Error: Cannot find module \'node-jqunit\'
2015-10-27T15:27:05 * clown has quit
2015-10-27T15:27:13 <Bosmon> Justin_o - tried running npm install?
2015-10-27T15:27:35 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i destroyed my vagrant box and did a vagrant up
2015-10-27T15:27:38 <Justin_o> so it should have run
2015-10-27T15:27:42 <Bosmon> ok
2015-10-27T15:27:48 <colinclark> Bosmon: I forgot to mention how I spent a chunk of my weekend fixing up two libraries of mine
2015-10-27T15:27:58 <colinclark> which depended on node-jqunit
2015-10-27T15:28:14 <colinclark> and which suddenly found themselves unable to run their unit tests
2015-10-27T15:28:19 <Bosmon> I see
2015-10-27T15:28:22 <colinclark> of course, ultimately, it was still my mistake
2015-10-27T15:28:26 <Bosmon> I wonder what is going on
2015-10-27T15:28:31 <colinclark> in that this was the last of my "unqualified" git dependencies
2015-10-27T15:28:42 <Bosmon> Justin_o - well, I see the dependency listed in package.json
2015-10-27T15:28:58 <Bosmon> I wonder what error I can have made
2015-10-27T15:29:44 <Bosmon> Oh
2015-10-27T15:29:50 <Bosmon> I guess it\'s a devDependency
2015-10-27T15:30:22 <Bosmon> But it always was.......
2015-10-27T15:30:34 <Justin_o> Bosmon: ah, that would be the likely issue. Let me see if i can find out what\'s trying to call it
2015-10-27T15:30:42 <Bosmon> "how did this ever work"
2015-10-27T15:30:47 <Bosmon> Is a phrase which often comes to mind :)
2015-10-27T15:30:54 <Bosmon> colinclark - "how did this ever work"?
2015-10-27T15:31:03 * alanharnum has quit
2015-10-27T15:31:10 <colinclark> How did what ever work? :)
2015-10-27T15:31:36 <Justin_o> oh great, i think i just messed up my vm.. i\'ll recreate it during standup
2015-10-27T15:32:08 <slim_> Bosmon: so I\'ve reworked by settings handler but my getter/setter are not getting called.
2015-10-27T15:32:15 <slim_> any thoughts on how I debug it?
2015-10-27T15:32:21 <slim_> the code is now
2015-10-27T15:32:33 <Bosmon> slim_ - have you checked in a branch somewhere?
2015-10-27T15:32:37 <slim_> https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/65/files
2015-10-27T15:32:39 <Bosmon> Thanks
2015-10-27T15:32:49 * clown joined the channel
2015-10-27T15:32:54 <slim_> https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/280/files
2015-10-27T15:32:58 <slim_> yes - those 2
2015-10-27T15:33:20 <slim_> I think I have everything wired up but....
2015-10-27T15:33:26 <Bosmon> slim_ - yes, it seems like your names don\'t agree
2015-10-27T15:33:34 <slim_> ah - which ones
2015-10-27T15:33:59 <slim_> I tripled checked - is there any way so see error??
2015-10-27T15:34:10 <slim_> *to see errors in the console
2015-10-27T15:34:27 <Bosmon> Well I\'m surprised you don\'t get any errors in the console since you\'re referring to a nonexistent function
2015-10-27T15:34:30 <Bosmon> How are you testing?
2015-10-27T15:34:50 <slim_> running GPII and login in sammyRes (see those files_
2015-10-27T15:35:20 <slim_> I get a mass of payload data that overflow the windows buffer
2015-10-27T15:35:25 <Bosmon> I see
2015-10-27T15:35:30 <slim_> so if there are errors Ibefore I don\'t see them
2015-10-27T15:35:37 * sepidehshahi has quit
2015-10-27T15:35:47 <Bosmon> Easy to make the buffer bigger - it can accept values up to 9999 lines : P
2015-10-27T15:35:57 <Bosmon> I speak as a hardened Windows user :)
2015-10-27T15:36:17 <Bosmon> So this function doesn\'t exist - windows.displaySettingsHandler.getImpl

b'2015-10-27T13:44:11 <the-t-in-rtf> Let me know if anything is unclear, I can hopefully dig up non-confusing examples of each approach.
2015-10-27T13:46:59 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: could you send me an example of the kettle data source. I don\'t think i\'ll want to add a dependency on kettle, but i\'d be interested to see how it works
2015-10-27T13:51:29 <the-t-in-rtf> Here is one that reads using the data source when a request is received, and then sends the response when the data source finishing reading:

2015-10-27T13:52:15 <the-t-in-rtf> I use transform rules a lot on inputs and outputs to give a bit more flexibility, I hope it\'s reasonably clear what\'s going on there.
2015-10-27T13:52:27 <the-t-in-rtf> jeez, English.

2015-10-27T14:00:54 <slim_> colinclark: ping
2015-10-27T14:01:05 <colinclark> Hi slim_, what\'s up?
2015-10-27T14:01:35 <slim_> looking through the code I notice everyhting seems ot go into a fluid namespace
2015-10-27T14:01:52 <slim_> even stuff that could potenitally be left private to a file/module
2015-10-27T14:01:53 <colinclark> In the GPII, everything goes in the "gpii" namespace, slim_
2015-10-27T14:02:06 <slim_> is that a pattern?
2015-10-27T14:02:32 <slim_> OK
2015-10-27T14:03:15 <colinclark> Just so I understand, are you asking if it\'s a pattern to make all of our useful functions public?
2015-10-27T14:03:19 <slim_> colinclark: so you create a specific namespace for private/implementation details?
2015-10-27T14:03:27 <slim_> certainly the windows spi handler does tht
2015-10-27T14:03:39 <colinclark> No, it\'s a public namespace
2015-10-27T14:03:51 <slim_> yeah, true
2015-10-27T14:03:55 <colinclark> It\'s personal, but it\'s public
2015-10-27T14:04:05 <slim_> so nothing is private / hidden
2015-10-27T14:04:12 <slim_> huh?
2015-10-27T14:04:22 <slim_> wishing I hadnt asked :)
2015-10-27T14:04:32 <colinclark> Why are you wishing you hadn\'t asked?
2015-10-27T14:04:34 <colinclark> I don\'t understand
2015-10-27T14:04:38 * anastasiac has quit
2015-10-27T14:04:41 <slim_> coz I don\'t understand
2015-10-27T14:05:04 <colinclark> Okay, so let\'s talk it through
2015-10-27T14:05:08 <Justin_o> Bosmon: hello, if you have time, all of my pull requests should be ready for more review
2015-10-27T14:05:09 <slim_> OK. in a specific settings handler there are details that are private
2015-10-27T14:05:19 <colinclark> What details are private, slim_?
2015-10-27T14:05:29 <slim_> but everyhting I have seen gets put in a fluid namespace
2015-10-27T14:05:42 <slim_> ever yvar that coudl be scoped to module / file
2015-10-27T14:06:03 <colinclark> I think perhaps you\'ll have to be more specific
2015-10-27T14:06:13 <slim_> OK in set res handler I have a function that wraps windows API
2015-10-27T14:06:33 <slim_> that doesn\'t need to be seen by anyone else at all
2015-10-27T14:06:36 <colinclark> Sounds like a useful function
2015-10-27T14:06:41 <colinclark> why doesn\'t it need to be seen by anyone else?
2015-10-27T14:07:09 <slim_> ah - takke that to an extreme then every function ever is potentially useful
2015-10-27T14:07:19 <slim_> so never have private details ever
2015-10-27T14:07:23 <colinclark> I\'m not sure it\'s about extremes
2015-10-27T14:07:23 <slim_> is tha tyour position?
2015-10-27T14:07:25 <Bosmon> slim_ - that\'s correct, yes
2015-10-27T14:07:33 <colinclark> I think it\'s about making sure something is maximally reusable
2015-10-27T14:07:45 <slim_> so you have to be REALL DISCIPLINED to not end up with spagetting code
2015-10-27T14:07:54 <colinclark> That\'s why we have a very good framework to support us
2015-10-27T14:08:02 <colinclark> to avoid producing spaghetti
2015-10-27T14:08:13 <colinclark> along with a good code review process
2015-10-27T14:08:17 <Bosmon> Also, if a function has no side-effects, it\'s very hard to produce spaghetti
2015-10-27T14:08:19 <slim_> basically everyhting is global - but namespaced?
2015-10-27T14:08:24 * danayo joined the channel
2015-10-27T14:08:27 * jhung has quit
2015-10-27T14:08:27 <colinclark> Yes, that\'s right, slim_
2015-10-27T14:08:40 <slim_> agree but this has side affects and this is not FRP
2015-10-27T14:08:46 <Bosmon> I had to think a little to try to guess what the connection might be between having lots of public functions and spaghetti : P
2015-10-27T14:09:02 <slim_> ok, i\'ll follow the style, but it goes against the grain for me
2015-10-27T14:09:15 <slim_> hehe
2015-10-27T14:09:17 * anvk has quit
2015-10-27T14:09:35 <colinclark> slim_: It\'s worth meditating on
2015-10-27T14:09:39 <colinclark> As you make things private
2015-10-27T14:09:46 <colinclark> "why do I need to do this?"
2015-10-27T14:09:49 <Bosmon> It took us many years to realise that it was important to make things public
2015-10-27T14:09:51 <colinclark> "who might benefit from this?"
2015-10-27T14:09:53 <colinclark> It takes time
2015-10-27T14:09:58 <slim_> so we are careful with namespacing to organise all the public functions
2015-10-27T14:10:02 <Bosmon> "as late as 2009" we still weren\'t completely sure about it
2015-10-27T14:10:31 <Bosmon> But in the end, you realise that every function you make private is an invitation to some to reuse by cut and pasting it
2015-10-27T14:10:47 <colinclark> A big part of the goal is to make sure that we\'re providing a solid foundation for the GPII to continue to grow, and that means we need to support unexpected usage
2015-10-27T14:10:48 <slim_> is this fluid policy or just gpii?
2015-10-27T14:11:06 <colinclark> slim_: I\'m not sure I understand the question
2015-10-27T14:11:17 <slim_> though cut and paste can reduce coupling :)
2015-10-27T14:11:30 <colinclark> slim_: hahaha
2015-10-27T14:11:36 * anastasiac joined the channel
2015-10-27T14:11:40 <slim_> don\'t worry - I\'ll just copy the style I see
2015-10-27T14:11:56 <colinclark> I\'m not worried :)
2015-10-27T14:11:59 <colinclark> you sound a bit worried ;)
2015-10-27T14:12:18 <Bosmon> Yes, cut and paste certainly reduces coupling
2015-10-27T14:12:28 <Bosmon> But then cutting off your leg reduces coupling too : P
2015-10-27T14:12:34 <slim_> hmmm - just a sacred cow I guess - but at y age you gotta be wiling to sacrefice a few
2015-10-27T14:12:57 * clown joined the channel
2015-10-27T14:13:12 <Bosmon> I guess this analogy is closer than I thought
2015-10-27T14:13:14 <slim_> now I understand why I can happily follow
2015-10-27T14:13:18 <Bosmon> I had just been being flippant : P
2015-10-27T14:13:19 <slim_> and also digest
2015-10-27T14:13:25 <colinclark> cool, slim_
2015-10-27T14:13:28 <Bosmon> But I realise now that cut and paste only OSTENSIBLY reduces coupling
2015-10-27T14:13:37 <colinclark> It\'s always good to talk about it--understand the motivations
2015-10-27T14:13:43 <Bosmon> In that, you just stop getting informed about the consequences of it
2015-10-27T14:14:01 <Bosmon> Similarly, cutting off your leg simply means you stop getting information back from your leg : P
2015-10-27T14:14:12 <slim_> I could really do with a f2f for doing this settings hanfdler - very steeplearning curve
2015-10-27T14:14:26 <slim_> Bosmon: STOP IT, NOW!!! :-P
2015-10-27T14:14:30 <Bosmon> slim_ - well IRC can be the next best thing :)
2015-10-27T14:14:54 <slim_> year - thoug a) my typing is crap b) can\'t find people.
2015-10-27T14:15:06 <slim_> so what does spi stand for?
2015-10-27T14:16:08 <slim_> colinclark: / Bosmon
2015-10-27T14:16:14 <Bosmon> SetParameterInfo
2015-10-27T14:16:37 <Bosmon> Actualy setParametersInfo
2015-10-27T14:16:38 <Bosmon> https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms724947(v=vs.85).aspx
2015-10-27T14:16:40 <slim_> Bosmon: aha - quite generic - liek it
2015-10-27T14:17:16 <slim_> Bosmon: oh yes now I recall that API
2015-10-27T14:17:20 <colinclark> SystemParametersInfo, you mean, right Bosmon?
2015-10-27T14:17:26 <slim_> so in settings handlers the is a .get and a .getImpl
2015-10-27T14:17:29 <slim_> why?
2015-10-27T14:17:37 <slim_> if everyhting public
2015-10-27T14:17:43 <Bosmon> oh yes
2015-10-27T14:17:54 <Bosmon> SystemParametersinfo
2015-10-27T14:18:00 <Bosmon> My eyesight is still a bit fuzzy : P
2015-10-27T14:18:14 <colinclark> your link was nonetheless correct :)
2015-10-27T14:18:26 * sepidehshahi has quit
2015-10-27T14:18:30 <slim_> it was - i beleived the link not Bosmon :-P
2015-10-27T14:18:44 <slim_> please see ^^^
2015-10-27T14:18:46 <Bosmon> slim_ - we discovered in the end that there is a standard workflow for settings handlers that means that we can wrap an implementation function with a standard handler
2015-10-27T14:19:22 <slim_> ah. I was going to say there\'s quite a bit of boiler plate
2015-10-27T14:19:25 <Bosmon> https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-100
2015-10-27T14:19:29 <slim_> hehe
2015-10-27T14:19:46 <slim_> wow 100 , way back
2015-10-27T14:19:46 <Bosmon> Wow, fixed at the PORTGUAL WORKSHOP
2015-10-27T14:19:49 <Bosmon> I don\'t remember that one
2015-10-27T14:20:24 <Bosmon> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/settingsHandlers/src/settingsHandlerUtilities.js#L121
2015-10-27T14:20:29 <Bosmon> You might find this utility helpful
2015-10-27T14:20:34 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2015-10-27T14:21:00 <Bosmon> Yes, you can see it being used here: https://github.com/GPII/windows/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/registrySettingsHandler/src/RegistrySettingsHandler.js#L272
2015-10-27T14:21:11 <slim_> it\'s used in the code Im looking at - but in the Impl child function
2015-10-27T14:21:33 <slim_> trouble is each handler is a bit different - makes learning on the job hard
2015-10-27T14:22:12 <slim_> Bosmon: yea been look at alll the windows handlers and also javi\'s xrandr
2015-10-27T14:22:20 <slim_> my brain is almost blown
2015-10-27T14:22:34 <Bosmon> slim_ - unfortunately there have not been the engineering resources to keep all these handlers properly factors
2015-10-27T14:22:36 <Bosmon> factored
2015-10-27T14:22:57 <Bosmon> A marvellous outcome of this exercise might be a writeup once you get your head around it on "how to write a new Settings Handler" : P
2015-10-27T14:23:01 <slim_> sure - story of the GPII -
2015-10-27T14:23:08 <slim_> technical debt WAT? ;)
2015-10-27T14:23:19 <slim_> but now Gregg has dosh
2015-10-27T14:23:39 <slim_> well That did cross my mind for sure
2015-10-27T14:23:48 <slim_> but not confident yet
2015-10-27T14:23:59 <Bosmon> slim_ - well, you know more than almost anyone else :)
2015-10-27T14:24:03 <slim_> was trying to do a quick handler fix - lol
2015-10-27T14:24:14 <slim_> ooooppppss
2015-10-27T14:24:30 <Bosmon> Certainly far more than anyone else Gregg might spend his new dosh on : P
2015-10-27T14:25:02 <slim_> aww shucks. is now a good time to ask for a raise?
2015-10-27T14:25:36 * slim_ remebers he\'s skipped lunch
2015-10-27T14:26:36 <slim_> Bosmon: one last q
2015-10-27T14:27:01 <slim_> fluid.defaults - why? And what on?
2015-10-27T14:27:42 <Bosmon> slim_ - yes, I was going to reply on the pull request about that
2015-10-27T14:27:58 <Bosmon> I\'ve finally had a bit of time to catch up on documentation debt which is currently going through a massive review phase
2015-10-27T14:28:23 <slim_> ok - can wait. I\'m rewokring code as my understanding grows - might want to wait a bit

2015-10-27T13:28:16 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: is there a way to make, or forward a request using gpii-express. basically i have a server that gets a request from the browser, the server then makes a request to the security server.
2015-10-27T13:30:57 <the-t-in-rtf> @justin_o: It depends what you mean by "forward"
2015-10-27T13:31:23 <the-t-in-rtf> I often perform a request based on a user\'s input and then get back to them once I have a result.
2015-10-27T13:32:14 <the-t-in-rtf> In some cases I have use mikeal\'s request library
2015-10-27T13:32:23 <the-t-in-rtf> in others I have used kettle data sources.
2015-10-27T13:33:42 <the-t-in-rtf> (such as the couchdb one)
