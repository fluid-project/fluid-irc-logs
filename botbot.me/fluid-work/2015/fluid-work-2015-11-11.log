b'2015-11-11T21:31:42 <alanharnum> which i think would be appropriate - like a subtitles definition file being separate from a video file
2015-11-11T21:32:44 <colinclark> Yes, exactly
2015-11-11T21:33:20 <colinclark> I\'ll trigger the text to speech and bind an event to the "done" event of that component
2015-11-11T21:33:44 <colinclark> when the text has been read, I\'ll then play the synth for a particular segment
2015-11-11T21:34:04 <colinclark> run a timer with Flocking\'s not-so-accurate scheduler to pause the synth after a specified duration
2015-11-11T21:34:11 <colinclark> and then start the next phase
2015-11-11T21:37:24 <alanharnum> so assuming we had two values, one at 65% of the pie, one at 35%, does each of those become an object divided into tens and ones, or is it all a single array of numbers?
2015-11-11T21:38:36 <colinclark> one array per segment
2015-11-11T21:38:46 <alanharnum> ok so something like: [{sonifyData: [10,10,10,10,10,10,1,1,1,1,1]},{sonifyData: [10,10,10,1,1,1,1,1]}]
2015-11-11T21:39:22 <colinclark> {label: "Cats", units: [10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10]}
2015-11-11T21:39:29 <colinclark> 100% CATS
2015-11-11T21:39:47 <colinclark> Or, since I can\'t count, 80% cats
2015-11-11T21:39:51 <colinclark> the rest, gerbils

b'2015-11-11T19:02:17 <colinclark> I know these are a work in progress, jhernandez
2015-11-11T19:02:19 <colinclark> sorry, jhung
2015-11-11T19:02:30 <colinclark> I\'m just making note of things I see while I try it out
2015-11-11T19:02:32 <colinclark> because it\'s awesome :)
2015-11-11T19:03:21 <jhung> colinclark: the tab focus is a good point. That would make it more consistent with conventional expectation.
2015-11-11T19:05:38 <jhung> as for the ghost pullers, it\'d be nice to have them there for sure. At least it\'s still usable the way it is now.
2015-11-11T19:05:50 <colinclark> workable is nice
2015-11-11T19:05:56 <colinclark> a great start :)
2015-11-11T19:06:09 * clown has quit
2015-11-11T19:06:22 <colinclark> I think sighted users will probably find it much more usable if there\'s something that invites or affords the interaction
2015-11-11T19:06:46 <colinclark> I haven\'t tried with a screenreader, but I imagine you have labels like "drop puller on this knot" or something like that?
2015-11-11T19:07:37 <jhung> I\'ve only tried voice over briefly yesterday. I have not done extensive testing.
2015-11-11T19:08:08 <jhung> As for an invitation to place a puller - I\'d love to have my waving pullers on the rope.
2015-11-11T19:08:38 <colinclark> yeah, true :)
2015-11-11T19:08:41 <colinclark> that was awesome

2015-11-11T20:24:38 <simonjb> hey Bosmon, I\'m working on some prep for next week\'s meetings and was having a look at how we bind our kettle servers -- it looks to me like we aren\'t binding to a specific host when we start an express instance for kettle -- does that match your understanding? https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/blob/master/lib/server.js#L199
2015-11-11T20:25:50 * clown has quit
2015-11-11T20:30:58 <colinclark> alanharnum: Here is a very, very raw sketch of the sound-generating portion of our sonification subsystem for the chart authoring tool: https://gist.github.com/colinbdclark/b9a50fdabd04ba0f888e
2015-11-11T20:31:28 <colinclark> It\'s not a particularly convincing replica of Dana\'s electric piano sound from Garage Band, but it is, as they say, good enough for rock and roll
2015-11-11T20:32:01 <colinclark> The implementation is also rather overly complex due to limitations in Flocking when it comes to things like doing additive synthesis
2015-11-11T20:32:32 <colinclark> so it\'s implemented as three separate synths representing the pitch, the main carrier oscillators, and the envelope generator segments
2015-11-11T20:33:02 <colinclark> using global interconnect buses (think of them like the patches in a modular synth) to connect each synth segment up
2015-11-11T20:34:10 <colinclark> When I get a moment I will move it into my fork of the chartAuthoring repository and start writing the scheduling code that will trigger sequences of "dits" and "dahs"
2015-11-11T20:34:35 <alanharnum> colinclark: cool!
2015-11-11T20:35:22 <alanharnum> so if i drop this into a Flocking setup will it play stuff at me?
2015-11-11T20:36:27 <colinclark> alanharnum: Yep, there\'s a comment about it here: https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLOE-437?focusedCommentId=28023&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-28023
2015-11-11T20:36:44 <colinclark> Paste it into the "staging" branch of the Flocking Playground, hit the play button, and then click your mouse like a robot
2015-11-11T20:37:04 <colinclark> I can\'t wait until the Playground is integrated directly with Gist
2015-11-11T20:37:25 <colinclark> so I can send you a link that is immediately playable
2015-11-11T20:37:32 <colinclark> but still version controlled :)
2015-11-11T20:38:30 <Bosmon> simonjb - that is correct, yes
2015-11-11T20:38:53 <simonjb> ok, cool, thanks Bosmon
2015-11-11T20:39:13 <simonjb> this means that we bind to 0.0.0.0 and accept connections from anywhere
2015-11-11T20:39:21 <Bosmon> simonjb - yes
2015-11-11T20:39:29 <Bosmon> I can easily add configuration to the upcoming version of Kettle to improve this
2015-11-11T20:39:34 <simonjb> so you can log in or log out a user if you know their ip address
2015-11-11T20:40:13 <simonjb> I know we talked about this a while ago, any ideas if we files a JIRA for it?
2015-11-11T20:40:20 <alanharnum> colinclark: that\'s some nice beeps
2015-11-11T20:40:21 <simonjb> I\'ll do a search
2015-11-11T20:40:30 <colinclark> alanharnum: Sweet, eh?
2015-11-11T20:40:33 <simonjb> thanks Bosmon
2015-11-11T20:40:53 <colinclark> If you lengthen the sustain stage of the envelope, it sounds just like a truck backing up
2015-11-11T20:41:04 <colinclark> seriously sophisticated sonification, alanharnum :P
2015-11-11T20:41:14 <Bosmon> simonjb - the notes from our San Diego (2014!) meeting seem most relevant to this point - https://wiki.gpii.net/w/Architecture_Ideas,_Sketches,_and_Meeting_Notes#Security_and_Privacy
2015-11-11T20:41:14 <alanharnum> colinclark: better than i could do :P
2015-11-11T20:41:24 <Bosmon> Since we identified numerous attack vectors with respect to the local flow manager
2015-11-11T20:41:34 <Bosmon> I don\'t think many of these ended up as individual JIRAs
2015-11-11T20:41:52 <colinclark> alanharnum: If you want, we can talk through how it works so you will be able to make your own Magical Beeps
2015-11-11T20:42:11 <alanharnum> colinclark: at some time soon would love to do that
2015-11-11T20:42:16 * the-t-in-rtf has quit
2015-11-11T20:42:21 <alanharnum> maybe after the scheduler is implemented
2015-11-11T20:43:08 <colinclark> yup
2015-11-11T20:43:21 * alanharnum changes numbers randomly and emits painfully high-pitched sounds into his ears.
2015-11-11T20:43:28 <Bosmon> This is a variant which would be addressed by some of the same responses - since we need to secure the FlowManager against arbitrary requests issuing from the local machine, as well as those from its network segment.....
2015-11-11T20:43:38 <colinclark> ouch alanharnum, be careful!
2015-11-11T20:43:47 * colinclark says from experience
2015-11-11T20:44:57 <alanharnum> colinclark: i apparently shouldn\'t just change the number 1 to the number 11
2015-11-11T20:45:02 <alanharnum> even in homage to Spinal Tap
2015-11-11T20:45:07 <colinclark> OUCH
2015-11-11T20:45:12 <colinclark> which number 1 did you change?
2015-11-11T20:45:34 <alanharnum> the ones in the the envelope level :)
2015-11-11T20:45:36 <colinclark> eek, yes
2015-11-11T20:45:38 <colinclark> ouch ouch
2015-11-11T20:45:41 <colinclark> you ok? :)
2015-11-11T20:45:47 <colinclark> Amplitude in most computer music systems ranges from 0 to 1
2015-11-11T20:46:07 <alanharnum> yeah i\'m ine
2015-11-11T20:46:08 <colinclark> So, in Spinal Tap terms, 1.0 is the equivalent of being cranked up to 10
2015-11-11T20:46:15 <alanharnum> at least i didn\'t put it up to 100 :)
2015-11-11T20:46:31 <alanharnum> the first time my "prod code i don\'t understand by changing variables" approach has had these results!
2015-11-11T20:46:42 <colinclark> Yeah
2015-11-11T20:46:46 <colinclark> there are risks sometimes
2015-11-11T20:46:57 <colinclark> I recommend experimenting without headphones
2015-11-11T20:47:14 <colinclark> and with speakers you have a physical volume control for, such as the ones built into your laptop
2015-11-11T20:47:19 <simonjb> thanks Bosmon for digging out those notes
2015-11-11T20:48:08 <simonjb> securing http traffic on the user\'s machine is something that we haven\'t worked on yet I think
2015-11-11T20:51:23 * clown1 is now known as clown
2015-11-11T21:16:25 <colinclark> alanharnum: Getting more insane: https://gist.github.com/colinbdclark/b9a50fdabd04ba0f888e
2015-11-11T21:16:42 <colinclark> I think danayo\'s durations are a little off so I\'ll have to tighten up the pips a bit
2015-11-11T21:16:47 * jhung1 joined the channel
2015-11-11T21:17:20 <colinclark> Once Bergson has been integrated with Flocking, this kind of stuff will be so much less ugly, alanharnum
2015-11-11T21:17:34 <colinclark> but in the meantime we\'ll just have to party like it\'s 1962

2015-11-11T21:18:36 * michelled wonders if that means alanharnum will grow his hair long
2015-11-11T21:18:42 <colinclark> What we\'ll do is just write a model transformation that takes arrays of segment sizes and produces arrays of pitches and envelope triggers
2015-11-11T21:18:58 <alanharnum> michelled: i\'m uncertain if i can grow my hair that long again successfully, that hair was from 2007 :P

2015-11-11T21:22:25 <alanharnum> colinclark: even having basic data sonification is going to be really cool, thanks colinclark
2015-11-11T21:22:45 <colinclark> alanharnum: I wish it were more awesome, man
2015-11-11T21:22:48 <colinclark> but we have to start somehwere
2015-11-11T21:23:21 <colinclark> even if it\'s a pile of grades sitting in a gist, which produce, as you say, beepies
2015-11-11T21:23:28 <alanharnum> fwiw https://github.com/waharnum/chartAuthoring/tree/FLOE-437 has a "sonification" subcomponent mocked, along with a model relay + transform from the dataset to the sonification array of objects we talked about
2015-11-11T21:24:07 <alanharnum> if you want something to be awesome you start from it being not awesome but working, then iterate on it!
2015-11-11T21:24:17 <colinclark> This critter, alanharnum? https://github.com/waharnum/chartAuthoring/blob/FLOE-437/src/js/chartAuthoring.js#L107-L122
2015-11-11T21:25:45 <alanharnum> colinclark: yup
2015-11-11T21:26:00 <colinclark> cool
2015-11-11T21:26:48 <colinclark> Do you have time to hack a little more on it for me, alanharnum?
2015-11-11T21:27:00 <alanharnum> colinclark: if you\'re looking to easily see what sonification data of a chart will look like, you can add console logging to https://github.com/waharnum/chartAuthoring/blob/FLOE-437/src/js/chartAuthoring.js#L193-L211
2015-11-11T21:27:24 <alanharnum> colinclark: sure - let me just finish something
2015-11-11T21:27:31 <colinclark> no rush
2015-11-11T21:27:51 <colinclark> I\'m just thinking life might be even easier if we have a transform that will convert to a "lower level" semantic
2015-11-11T21:27:55 <colinclark> or maybe it\'s not lower level
2015-11-11T21:27:58 <colinclark> maybe it\'s just different
2015-11-11T21:28:05 <colinclark> something a touch more "musical"
2015-11-11T21:28:35 <alanharnum> colinclark: what do you have in mind?
2015-11-11T21:28:41 <colinclark> Perhaps an array of numbers representing our tens and ones
2015-11-11T21:28:51 <colinclark> since that\'s ultimately what we sonify
2015-11-11T21:29:53 <colinclark> Insane though it seems, you could produce a data structure like this: 23 -> [10, 10, 1, 1, 1]
2015-11-11T21:30:15 <colinclark> and I will translate that into durations and pitches with a simple lookup table in the sonification component\'s options
2015-11-11T21:30:25 <colinclark> so the basic pitch and duration of "tens" and "ones" can be configurable
2015-11-11T21:30:53 <alanharnum> colinclark: how do we align that with the need to speak the labels?
2015-11-11T21:31:14 <alanharnum> two separate arrays, maybe, with synced timings?
2015-11-11T21:31:21 <colinclark> Well, I imagine it will roughly look like this:
2015-11-11T21:31:28 <alanharnum> or maybe a separate data structure for speech labels vs sonification
2015-11-11T21:31:32 <colinclark> yes

2015-11-11T14:27:33 <Justin_o> anastasiac: thanks, can you let me know when those to pull requests are ready for more review
2015-11-11T14:28:04 <anastasiac> Justin_o: I think that one is good to go, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there are any comments that I haven\xe2\x80\x99t responded to
2015-11-11T14:28:39 <Justin_o> anastasiac: okay, thanks, i\'ll try to look at it again today

2015-11-11T14:52:38 <cindyli> alanharnum: ur comment on FLOE-432 says - A pull request is in for the visual design aspects: https://github.com/fluid-project/chartAuthoring/pull/10
2015-11-11T14:53:06 <cindyli> does it mean some parts described in this jira are not covered by the pull request?
2015-11-11T14:53:27 <cindyli> such as sounds
2015-11-11T14:53:28 <alanharnum> cindyli: yeah, the sonification pieces specifically
2015-11-11T14:53:41 <alanharnum> cindyli: there\'s a separate sub-task for that (FLOE-436)
2015-11-11T14:54:14 <alanharnum> FLOE-432 is kind of a catch-all "demo polishing" issue
2015-11-11T14:54:22 <alanharnum> I can reorganize it if it\'s confusing
2015-11-11T14:54:36 <alanharnum> which it probably is, given the description is just a dump of a piratepad from a meeting :p
2015-11-11T14:54:50 <cindyli> alanharnum: would be nice if you could reorganize it.
2015-11-11T14:55:11 <alanharnum> ok will do
2015-11-11T14:55:25 <cindyli> btw, FLOE-436 is about the editable title and description, alanharnum, we probably can create a separate jira for sounds
2015-11-11T14:55:49 <alanharnum> oh sorry - FLOE-437
2015-11-11T14:56:12 <cindyli> ok, i see. thanks

2015-11-11T16:12:43 <michelled> do you have a sense for when it will go live?

2015-11-11T16:15:14 <alanharnum> gtirloni and I are looking at the server-level rewrite rules right now
2015-11-11T16:17:16 * sgithens_ is now known as sgithens
2015-11-11T16:18:06 <jhung> The redirect isn\'t there yet alanharnum. I\'ll have a pull req in there shortly.
2015-11-11T16:18:57 <jhung> michelled: not sure when it will be live. First round of testing is Thursday
2015-11-11T16:19:24 <jhung> Depends on that feedback michelled
2015-11-11T16:19:35 <jhung> There\'s a dev version online currently.
2015-11-11T16:19:41 <michelled> jhung, anastasiac: I think it might be a good time for a news article on the PhET work. Can you collaborate on it?
2015-11-11T16:19:57 <alanharnum> jhung: was there an issue with redirecting some of the old-style mediawiki ones via docpad, or did we find  a way around that?
2015-11-11T16:20:04 <michelled> it could point to the dev version and talk about user testing and also talk about all the other work you are doing with them -
2015-11-11T16:21:22 <anastasiac> sure, michelled.
2015-11-11T16:21:57 <anastasiac> jhung, do you want to send me notes and facts/links/etc? I can draft something, you can review it?
2015-11-11T16:22:48 <michelled> anastasiac: I think we should also have a news article after Open Ed. Perhaps you can consider that while you are there
2015-11-11T16:23:35 <anastasiac> good point, michelled, will do

2015-11-11T18:50:48 <jhung> anastasiac: here is the latest version of the Forces and Motion basics sim http://www.colorado.edu/physics/phet/dev/html/forces-and-motion-basics/1.1.5-accessible-instance.3/forces-and-motion-basics_en.html?accessibility&screens=1
2015-11-11T18:52:11 <jhung> That implementation is based on the wireframe found on this wiki page anastasiac: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/PhET+Simulation+Design
2015-11-11T18:52:22 <jhung> I\'m currently fixing up that page a little.
2015-11-11T19:01:15 <colinclark> I wonder if we should have little ghost pullers visible when focus moves to the knot?
2015-11-11T19:02:11 <colinclark> I also imagine we should move focus to the next activatable element when we tab out of the "select puller" mode, rather than moving it back on to the parent element
