2015-09-08T13:39:06 <cindyli> this is great
2015-09-08T13:39:17 <cindyli> a cool idea
2015-09-08T13:41:57 <cindyli> simonjb: i\'m thinking to write a wiki page of the couchdb design for the security server. should this doc go to wiki.gpii.net?
2015-09-08T13:43:09 <simonjb> that\'s a great idea cindyli, and yes, wiki.gpii.net would be a good location
2015-09-08T13:43:17 <cindyli> simonjb: i don\'t have a login on this wiki yet, will request one

2015-09-08T15:05:15 <michelled1> but perhaps we should meet in the fluid-standup room?

2015-09-08T15:35:49 <colinclark> Last week I worked a bit (on things like your job evaluation forms) and also was away a bit to work on my thesis
2015-09-08T15:35:58 <colinclark> this week I\xe2\x80\x99ll be here today working on the P4A architecture report
2015-09-08T15:36:04 <colinclark> and then probably off again to thesisize

2015-09-08T16:42:25 <cindyli> anastasiac: I left a couple of minor changes. also a link to a sample code explanation graph in case it might inspire you :)

2015-09-08T19:51:36 <simonjb> michelled: I had a question about the face to face
2015-09-08T19:51:49 <simonjb> "Integration of secure read access of preferences for web apps:"
2015-09-08T19:51:55 <simonjb> ends in colon
2015-09-08T19:52:05 <simonjb> should those points have some indentation?
2015-09-08T19:52:36 <michelled> there is no indentation in the agenda
2015-09-08T19:52:45 <michelled> simonjb: can you see this doc?
2015-09-08T19:52:50 <michelled> https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0BxeyeN7jTpzSfnp2Z0JGa1lkUUJGQ0pFdmE5ZWpla016blhqRXdoMFBZb25NNHlod0pYRU0&usp=drive_web
2015-09-08T19:54:32 <simonjb> thanks michelled, I can read it and the colon is there with no indentation
2015-09-08T20:06:34 <anastasiac> michelled, colinclark: The First Discovery Tool tutorial is being drafted in Google Docs. I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering where it\xe2\x80\x99s final home should be: gpii wiki?
2015-09-08T20:06:55 <colinclark> Seems like as reasonable a place as any
2015-09-08T20:08:06 <anastasiac> it would take a bit of effort to style it in a mediawiki instance, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to do that unless we\xe2\x80\x99re pretty confident that\xe2\x80\x99s the plan :-)
