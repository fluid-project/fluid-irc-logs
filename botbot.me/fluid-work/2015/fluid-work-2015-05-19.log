2015-05-19T13:57:26 <michelled> I have a meeting now, but if everyone is around at 11, that should work
2015-05-19T13:59:01 <anastasiac> michelled, I should be around at 11

2015-05-19T14:08:01 <Justin_o> Bosmon, cindyli: I was experimenting with the synthesizers and language this morning. I\'ve found that  Chrome will switch the synthesizer with the two character code e.g. "fr" but safari will not. it needs something more specific like "fr-ca"
2015-05-19T14:08:22 <Bosmon> Justin_o - that\'s interesting
2015-05-19T14:08:47 <Bosmon> I imagine it\'s ok to do the demo in June with just Chrome
2015-05-19T14:08:55 * danaayotte joined the channel
2015-05-19T14:09:02 <Bosmon> Perhaps safari\'s behaviour is influenced by the list of voices that it has available?
2015-05-19T14:09:14 <Bosmon> We might have to do the "brokering" ourselves in order to direct it to pick a closer match
2015-05-19T14:10:00 <Justin_o> Bosmon: possible.. we might be demoing on an iPad or something too, so we have to make sure that things will work there as well
2015-05-19T14:10:08 <Justin_o> anastasiac: do you know what we\'ll be demoing on ?
2015-05-19T14:10:36 <anastasiac> Justin_o, Chrome and/or Safari, iPad and/or Android tablet
2015-05-19T14:11:13 * murilocrivellari has quit
2015-05-19T14:14:05 * murilocrivellari joined the channel
2015-05-19T14:14:21 <Justin_o> anastasiac: do we have a list of all the languages we\'ll want to use and which versions.. e.g. fr-ca
2015-05-19T14:15:07 <anastasiac> Justin_o, we\xe2\x80\x99re limited to languages that Chrome supports. For now, just French and Spanish (in addition to english). The French translation is being done in the States, so it\xe2\x80\x99s probably not French Canadian, eh?
2015-05-19T14:16:10 <Justin_o> anastasiac: thanks

2015-05-19T14:45:16 <anastasiac> Justin_o, the ctrl-R work has been deployed to master, right? and it\xe2\x80\x99s ctrl-R and not another key combination?
2015-05-19T14:45:35 <Justin_o> anastasiac: it\'s ctrl-option/alt-r
2015-05-19T14:45:55 <anastasiac> gotcha
2015-05-19T14:45:57 <anastasiac> thanks
2015-05-19T15:07:13 <anastasiac> michelled, how\xe2\x80\x99s your meeting? Are we doing the Floe checkin?
2015-05-19T15:08:43 <michelled> yep, let\'s do it
2015-05-19T15:09:12 <michelled> anastasiac, cindyli, danaayotte, Justin_o, simonjb, sepideh: let\'s meet in the vidyo standup room
2015-05-19T15:09:37 <danaayotte> ok
2015-05-19T15:09:39 <cindyli> sure
2015-05-19T15:09:41 <sepideh> ok

2015-05-19T16:03:21 * sepideh joined the channel
2015-05-19T16:03:28 <michelled> cindyli: I suppose it actually makes sense for you to pick up 341 first
2015-05-19T16:03:35 <michelled> and then move on to new screens :)
2015-05-19T16:05:29 <Bosmon> Hi there michelled
2015-05-19T16:06:16 <cindyli> sure, michelled
2015-05-19T16:07:37 <michelled> Bosmon: I\'m a little worried about the first discovery tool in that the language work is taking longer to get right than we expected
2015-05-19T16:07:48 <michelled> I was wondering if you have some time to help us with the tool
2015-05-19T16:09:10 <Bosmon> sure
2015-05-19T16:10:42 <michelled> one area where I think your help would be great is in updating the icon bar at the bottom of the tool to implement the scrolling for when where are more then 5 screens
2015-05-19T16:11:35 <michelled> there is no JIRA for it yet - danaayotte, would you be able to explain the behaviour you wanted there?
2015-05-19T16:12:42 <danaayotte> yes michelled, you mean explain in in the JIRA?
2015-05-19T16:13:17 <michelled> yes, that would be ideal - create a JIRA for the work, link to designs etc.
2015-05-19T16:13:27 <michelled> that way we capture all the details in one place
2015-05-19T16:14:22 <michelled> Bosmon: this is one of the two places where we need to do some refactoring on the tool this week, and I\'d really love to get the refactoring tasks out of the way so we can start adding the new screens that depend on them
2015-05-19T16:17:05 <Bosmon> ok
2015-05-19T16:17:44 <Bosmon> So when I asked you about "what strategy" we were planning to use for this, I was wondering what we had in the way of existing bits and pieces such as images, CSS and markup that related to what we wanted
2015-05-19T16:19:21 <danaayotte> michelled Bosmon I will create a JIRA and attach wireframes, yes?
2015-05-19T16:19:28 <Bosmon> danaayotte - certainly, yes
2015-05-19T16:19:52 <Bosmon> And how does the process work whereby we get hold of buttons and CSS that match the wireframes - has it traditionally been jhung that does this?
2015-05-19T16:21:40 <danaayotte> both jhung and anastasiac have been doing the styling work for PGA

2015-05-19T18:03:46 <simonjb> hi danaayotte and anastasiac, do you both have a moment to chat about http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLOE-333
2015-05-19T18:04:02 <anastasiac> fluid-everyone, a question for the GPII tech folks: \xe2\x80\x9cDoes GPII separate context and device or is device part of (and in some situations all of) the context?\xe2\x80\x9d
2015-05-19T18:04:06 <anastasiac> simonjb, sure
2015-05-19T18:04:40 <danaayotte> simonjb in ET group meeting now - I\'m free in an hour
2015-05-19T18:05:13 <simonjb> ok, thanks danaayotte, can you ping me when you\'re available?
2015-05-19T18:05:23 <danaayotte> will do
2015-05-19T18:06:43 <Justin_o> anastasiac: i believe that the way it currently is, the device is part of the context. So the latter.
2015-05-19T18:08:14 <simonjb> anastasiac and cindyli: does chatting in an hour work for you both?
2015-05-19T18:08:41 <cindyli> fine with me, simonjb
2015-05-19T18:10:11 <colinclark> anastasiac: why do you ask?
2015-05-19T18:19:31 <anastasiac> sorry for the delay, colinclark, I had to step away. The question comes from Andy Heath
2015-05-19T18:19:51 <colinclark> It\'s interesting that Justin_o was able to so readily answer the question
2015-05-19T18:19:56 <colinclark> since I didn\'t fully understand it
2015-05-19T18:20:10 <colinclark> can you elaborate your understanding of what Andy is interested in?
2015-05-19T18:20:14 <colinclark> I don\'t quite get it :)
2015-05-19T18:20:55 <anastasiac> dunno - that\xe2\x80\x99s all he said! I could ask for clarification, but I should probably direct him to an appropriate forum for the question. Would that be the architecture list?
2015-05-19T18:21:07 <colinclark> I suppose it would be
2015-05-19T18:21:22 <colinclark> Though, to be honest, I\'ve never found Andy\'s posts to the architecture list very cogent, either :)
2015-05-19T18:22:32 <anastasiac> :-)
2015-05-19T18:23:18 <colinclark> I guess the simplest way to answer the question is to say that various aspects of the device can be taken into account with the GPII context-awareness system
2015-05-19T18:23:32 <colinclark> So the device forms part of the system\'s notion of "the current context"
2015-05-19T18:23:55 <colinclark> this might include "this particular device"
2015-05-19T18:24:05 <colinclark> but it can also include various aspects of the device\'s characteristics
2015-05-19T18:24:19 <colinclark> is that what you were thinking, Justin_o?
2015-05-19T18:33:29 * sepideh joined the channel
2015-05-19T18:36:07 <Justin_o> colinclark: i was answering the question based on the current PMT work, where the device can be chosen as part of the context
2015-05-19T18:36:26 * clown has quit
2015-05-19T18:36:48 <Justin_o> or maybe it\'s more accurate to say that the device can be chosen when creating a new set.
2015-05-19T18:38:29 * yzen joined the channel
2015-05-19T18:41:01 * clown joined the channel
2015-05-19T18:42:10 <colinclark> right
2015-05-19T18:42:43 <colinclark> of course the PMT is a major simplification of what is possible at the level of the preference set format and the underlying framework
2015-05-19T18:43:02 <colinclark> which I\'m guessing is more what Andy is interested in, but I\'m really not sure :)
2015-05-19T18:43:08 <Justin_o> colinclark: yes, still lots to implement there i\'m sure

2015-05-19T19:24:35 <simonjb> good for me
