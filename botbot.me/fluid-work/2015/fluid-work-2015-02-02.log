2015-02-02T16:28:43 <slim_jim> I\'m starting an issue paper for W3C cog a11y on gathering preferences and wondered if you thought much about peeps with cognitive accessibility issues?
2015-02-02T16:28:58 <slim_jim> if so do you have any notes or other resources?
2015-02-02T16:29:18 <slim_jim> Need to describe the issue people have with

2015-02-02T16:38:39 <Jess_> slim_jim: danaayotte might have more directly related links. dunno if any of the HCII papers would be useful
2015-02-02T16:39:15 <slim_jim> Jess_: OK tah, I\'ll skim them again

2015-02-02T20:25:38 <cindyli> Justin_o: regarding the name for the navButtons function to apply an offset to the model value, what about setCurrentPanelNum?
2015-02-02T20:26:06 <Justin_o> cindyli: but it still doesn\'t really set the number, you are really only moving it by some value
2015-02-02T20:26:40 <cindyli> it calculates and sets the new model value, Justin_o
2015-02-02T20:26:53 * kasparnet joined the channel
2015-02-02T20:26:53 <cindyli> do you have some idea?

2015-02-02T20:47:47 <cindyli> anastasiac, Bosmon, do you have a good name for this function - https://github.com/cindyli/first-discovery/blob/FLOE-252/src/js/navButtons.js#L107-L113
2015-02-02T20:48:47 <cindyli> it\'s to apply an offset to a model value that is the current panel number
2015-02-02T20:48:52 <anastasiac> cindyli: updateCurrentPanel? updatePanelNum?
2015-02-02T20:49:11 <Bosmon> How about "function which should be implemented using a limitRange transform"? : P
2015-02-02T20:49:55 <cindyli> Bosmon: can limiteRange also apply an offset or we need 2 transformations for this?
2015-02-02T20:50:18 <Bosmon> Well, you will still need the update function itself
2015-02-02T20:50:37 <cindyli> ok
