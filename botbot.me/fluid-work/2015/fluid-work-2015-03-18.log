2015-03-18T16:09:15 <slim_jim> kasparnet: ping
2015-03-18T16:09:44 <slim_jim> colinclark: loving the coffee, Do you reuse filters? If so how many times?
2015-03-18T16:09:56 <colinclark> I do sometimes, yes
2015-03-18T16:10:05 <colinclark> Though I found quite quickly that they\'re nearly endless
2015-03-18T16:10:18 <colinclark> so I don\'t often unless I\'m making several cups in a row (if I have company, or whatever)
2015-03-18T16:10:55 <colinclark> You should ask michelled about her technique for reusing filters sometime :)
2015-03-18T16:13:21 <slim_jim> colinclark: hehe, will do
2015-03-18T16:13:47 * michelled joined the channel
2015-03-18T16:14:27 <slim_jim> colinclark: as kasparnet not responding I have a couple of Qs coming form the TigerTeam and would like to raise at Arch meeting today.
2015-03-18T16:14:35 <colinclark> ok
2015-03-18T16:14:49 <kasparnet> slim_jim: sorry - i\'m here now
2015-03-18T16:14:51 <kasparnet> missed the first ping
2015-03-18T16:14:54 <colinclark> K and I are both in the P4A Scientific Advisory Board meeting right now
2015-03-18T16:14:55 <slim_jim> however they may take some time so I could just ask and we decide if needs another meeting.
2015-03-18T16:14:57 <kasparnet> just cathing up
2015-03-18T16:15:04 <slim_jim> oh - yes I forgot!
2015-03-18T16:15:11 <slim_jim> so I\'ll ping the list
2015-03-18T16:16:07 <michelled> anastasiac: now is fine - but I don\'t think I have the answers you need
2015-03-18T16:16:15 <michelled> can you check in with Justin_o to see if he can answer them?
2015-03-18T16:16:27 <michelled> otherwise, maybe the three of us can meet to make a decision
2015-03-18T16:17:02 <anastasiac> michelled, can we hop on vidyo for a minute?

2015-03-18T16:44:32 <jhernand1z> colinclark: kasparnet since you both are in the P4A SAB meeting, are we having our arch meeting today?
2015-03-18T16:44:40 * jhernand1z is now known as jhernandez
2015-03-18T16:44:50 <colinclark> yeah, I think the idea is that kasparnet is going to sneak out of this meeting
2015-03-18T16:44:59 <colinclark> in order to attend the arch meeting
2015-03-18T16:45:03 <colinclark> I will stay here in the SAB meeting
2015-03-18T16:45:44 <jhernandez> xDDD
2015-03-18T16:45:59 <clown> yes, the arch meeting is so much more fun!
2015-03-18T16:46:04 <jhernandez> ok ok
2015-03-18T16:46:17 <colinclark> way more fun
2015-03-18T16:46:34 <colinclark> hey Justin_o, I have a quick dumb question for you
2015-03-18T16:53:13 <Justin_o> colinclark: hello
2015-03-18T16:53:45 <colinclark> Is there a reusable Infusion component that represents the "toggle switchy thing" that we see in a lot of our designs, especially the PMT?
2015-03-18T16:53:54 <colinclark> The thing that looks like an on/off switch
2015-03-18T16:54:46 * slim_jim joined the channel
2015-03-18T16:56:22 <Justin_o> hmm.. i don\'t think we have one in infusion.. there might be one in PMT/PCP.. but we were thinking of changing that in both places actually.
2015-03-18T16:57:02 <Justin_o> colinclark: ^
2015-03-18T16:57:11 <Justin_o> colinclark: i think this is the one from the PMT/PCP https://github.com/GPII/prefsEditors/blob/master/src/shared/adjusters/js/onOffSwitch.js
2015-03-18T16:57:25 <colinclark> ah, interesting
2015-03-18T16:57:26 <colinclark> ok
2015-03-18T16:57:48 <colinclark> I guess it predates model relay
2015-03-18T16:57:57 <colinclark> "onOffModelKey"
2015-03-18T16:58:56 <Justin_o> colinclark: yep, the prefsFramework was just recently updated to make use of the new modelRelay system
2015-03-18T16:59:03 <colinclark> right, yes
2015-03-18T16:59:58 <colinclark> I might, in my spare time, grab this component and generalize it enough that it could be used outside of the context of the preferences framework
2015-03-18T17:00:03 <colinclark> it seems like a useful thing
2015-03-18T17:00:10 <Justin_o> colinclark: that would be good..
2015-03-18T17:00:28 <Justin_o> i\'ll see if i can find something with dana\'s latest designs for it
2015-03-18T17:03:48 <Justin_o> colinclark: i think this one has the new style adjuster designs with the new on/off toggle http://wiki.fluidproject.org/download/attachments/34570511/adjuster-states-Sept-2.pdf?version=1&modificationDate=1409689500877&api=v2
2015-03-18T17:04:11 <colinclark> Oh interesting!
2015-03-18T17:04:15 <colinclark> Dana\'s gone "flat"
2015-03-18T17:04:17 <colinclark> :)
2015-03-18T17:04:24 <colinclark> We need a catchy name for it
2015-03-18T17:04:37 <colinclark> "Material Design" and that sort of thing :)
2015-03-18T17:04:44 <Justin_o> haha.. true
2015-03-18T17:06:55 <anastasiac> wow. These designs are nice. Just really nice.
2015-03-18T17:07:51 <colinclark> they\'re pretty cool
2015-03-18T17:08:07 <Justin_o> yah.. too bad we didn\'t have enough time to implement them.. she posted them back in September. Maybe we\'ll be able to get to it this year.
2015-03-18T17:49:25 <anastasiac> michelled, when you have a minute, could you review the epub exemplar page, to see if it describes anything you\xe2\x80\x99re aware of? http://handbook.floeproject.org/index.php?title=Case_study:_Exemplar
2015-03-18T18:19:29 <slim_jim> anastasiac: talking of ePub. When I logged into my OReilly account to day I found I can search and view all my ebooks with an epub format! FTW. Send them a copy!
