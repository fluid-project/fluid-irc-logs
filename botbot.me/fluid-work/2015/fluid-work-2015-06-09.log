2015-06-09T13:51:31 <Bosmon> Hi there cindyli1 - you pinged me last night?
2015-06-09T13:52:05 <cindyli1> yes, Bosmon, wanted to ask if we have a fluid function that returns the change part of an object
2015-06-09T13:53:19 <cindyli1> for example, i have a initial model (a nested object) that some values are changed, do we have a function to return the changed path and value pairs?
2015-06-09T13:54:09 <Bosmon> cindyli1 - we have fluid.model.diff
2015-06-09T13:54:13 <Bosmon> What\'s your usecase?
2015-06-09T13:54:16 * clown joined the channel
2015-06-09T13:54:50 * danaayotte has quit
2015-06-09T13:54:51 <cindyli1> Bosmon: as you know, for the prefs framework, we want to move all preference selections to a path called "preferences"
2015-06-09T13:55:23 <Bosmon> cindyli1 - I remember it
2015-06-09T13:55:34 <Bosmon> Although, following sgithens______, "I thought we had done this already" :)
2015-06-09T13:55:50 <Bosmon> Wasn\'t there a fatal bug that we needed to resolve that caused the entire UI to constantly rerender when we navigated?
2015-06-09T13:55:54 <Bosmon> How did we get around that problem
2015-06-09T13:56:07 <cindyli1> right now our save function compares the changed prefs with the initial model and only saves the changed part
2015-06-09T13:57:01 <Bosmon> cindyli1 - that save function is faulty anyway
2015-06-09T13:57:07 <cindyli1> ah, why?
2015-06-09T13:58:20 <Bosmon> cindyli1 - I guess we have not written up the issue properly
2015-06-09T13:58:26 <Bosmon> Although the discussion is held at https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-4686
2015-06-09T13:58:40 <Bosmon> Unfortunately it is a design as well as implementation issue
2015-06-09T13:58:55 <Bosmon> In that currently the user has no way to determine in the UI whether they mean to store a default value or not
2015-06-09T13:59:11 <Bosmon> Anyway yes - please carry on with explaining the usecase
2015-06-09T13:59:54 <cindyli1> ok, now the initial model could be something like:
2015-06-09T13:59:55 <cindyli1> {
2015-06-09T13:59:55 <cindyli1> \tuiStates: {
2015-06-09T13:59:55 <cindyli1> \t\tshow: true
2015-06-09T13:59:55 <cindyli1> \t},
2015-06-09T13:59:55 <cindyli1> \tpreferences: {
2015-06-09T13:59:56 <cindyli1> \t\ttextSize: 1,
2015-06-09T13:59:56 <cindyli1> \t\t...
2015-06-09T13:59:57 <cindyli1> \t}
2015-06-09T13:59:57 <cindyli1> }
2015-06-09T14:01:31 <cindyli1> i think the entire coming-in model also needs to be compared with the entire initial model to only save the changed parts
2015-06-09T14:02:26 <Bosmon> cindyli1 - ok
2015-06-09T14:02:48 <cindyli1> so, wanna know if we have a function to do this recursive comparison
2015-06-09T14:02:54 <Bosmon> cindyli1 - well, we do
2015-06-09T14:03:08 <cindyli1> fluid.model.diff?
2015-06-09T14:03:10 <Bosmon> Yes
2015-06-09T14:03:14 <cindyli1> cool. thanks
2015-06-09T14:03:20 <Bosmon> Doing this still feels a little wierd though
2015-06-09T14:03:35 <Bosmon> But thinking it through, I can\'t think that anything in particular will go wrong
2015-06-09T14:04:05 <cindyli1> ok, let me know if you think of anything better
2015-06-09T14:04:13 * murilocrivellari joined the channel
2015-06-09T14:04:34 <Bosmon> Well, there\'s nothing I can think of that\'s better, but I\'m just questioning again whether we really want to continue with this behaviour, in the absence of a UI which helps the user to manage it
2015-06-09T14:04:44 <Bosmon> But I guess we had better carry on with it until we can revisit the issue properly
2015-06-09T14:04:55 <cindyli1> ok
2015-06-09T14:05:21 <Bosmon> It certainly seems to be less harmful to persist defaults explicitly, since in the future we\'ll have no way of telling whether the user had meant to store them or not
2015-06-09T14:05:56 <Bosmon> Sorry, more harmful
2015-06-09T14:06:01 <Bosmon> not less harmful : P
2015-06-09T14:06:11 <Bosmon> Sorry, I feel I am mostly just adding confusion to this issue :)
2015-06-09T14:06:14 <cindyli1> that\'s true
2015-06-09T14:06:39 <cindyli1> "that\'s true" was for "we\'ll have no way of telling whether the user had meant to store them or not"
2015-06-09T14:06:47 <cindyli1> not "adding confusion", i know what you mean
2015-06-09T14:15:28 <Bosmon> Cheers cindyli1, you\'re very generous :)
2015-06-09T14:15:40 <Bosmon> So, how did we get around the excess UI update issue I mentioned above?
2015-06-09T14:18:56 <cindyli1> Bosmon: as i find, the entire UI only renders when any one of preference gets changed, not when you navigate. i think the way to fix it is to fire individual change request for each pref instead of firing against the root
2015-06-09T14:19:45 <cindyli1> means, more specific at firing change requests
2015-06-09T14:20:20 <Bosmon> cindyli1 - but wasn\'t there an issue that unless our preferences were in preferences.*, we couldn\'t set the UI refresh listener to only listen to those preferences rather than all the ones in uistate.* ?
2015-06-09T14:24:48 <cindyli1> Bosmon: we can move the model refresh listener down to each panel that listens to their own model value change. in terms of how to respond to changes on uiState, it should be handled by integrators depending on their use cases.
2015-06-09T14:25:03 <michelled> fluid-everyone: just a reminder that we will have our Floe planning meeting in half an hour when those of us who weren\'t in Washington will get an update on how it went.
2015-06-09T14:25:37 <cindyli1> ok, michelled
2015-06-09T14:26:02 <Justin_o> michelled: thanks for the reminder

2015-06-09T14:38:31 <murilocrivellari> hey sepideh, when are you available for a chat about the sonification sketches?
2015-06-09T14:39:06 <sepideh> Can we do it this afternoon, around 2:00?
2015-06-09T14:39:33 <murilocrivellari> sepideh: sure!
2015-06-09T14:39:40 <sepideh> great, thx
2015-06-09T14:39:47 <murilocrivellari> thank you
2015-06-09T14:53:11 <Bosmon> cindyli1 - you said - "we can" - is that what we actually did?
2015-06-09T14:53:26 <cindyli1> no, not yet
2015-06-09T14:53:39 <Bosmon> cindyli1 - so how did we avoid the excess updates problem in the demo?
2015-06-09T14:53:40 <cindyli1> there would be some details doing that
2015-06-09T14:54:39 <cindyli1> "the excess updates" you meant was every panel gets re-rendered when any one preference is changed, or the double rendering at any pref change?
2015-06-09T14:55:06 <Bosmon> cindyli1 - the panels getting rerendered when there was a uistate change
2015-06-09T14:58:45 <cindyli1> Bosmon: do you think if the panels should be re-rendered at a uistate change? i\'m thinking probably we should do this at least in the prefs framework. might make more sense for integrators to control that depending on their use case. In the case of the first discovery tool, uiStates mostly is to keep track of some state data.
2015-06-09T14:59:08 <cindyli1> "should not"
2015-06-09T14:59:24 <cindyli1> should not re-render at uiState change
2015-06-09T14:59:35 <Bosmon> cindyli1 - I\'m referring to a bug that Justin_o mentioned a couple of weeks ago
2015-06-09T14:59:47 <Bosmon> I guess we can talk about it later, after the update meeting.....
2015-06-09T14:59:52 <cindyli1> sure
