2015-04-29T17:26:17 <Justin_o> Bosmon, Bosmon7: I\'ve done some manual testing of cindyli1\'s FLOE-281 branch. Did you need to do more review?
2015-04-29T17:26:26 <Justin_o> Things are looking good from the manual testing
2015-04-29T17:26:27 <Bosmon> Justin_o - no, it\'s fine
2015-04-29T17:26:34 <Bosmon> Feel free to merge it if you think it works according to spec

2015-04-29T17:27:35 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes, other than it not actually setting the language :)
2015-04-29T17:28:34 <Bosmon> Justin_o - for that, you can review and merge my FLUID-5599 pull :)

2015-04-29T17:29:17 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks, cindyli1 was mentioning that to me today, but she said we\'d also have to make some changes to the prefsFramework
2015-04-29T17:29:40 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, there is still a gap to fill in

2015-04-29T17:32:51 * michelled joined the channel
2015-04-29T17:33:16 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I think we had decided it was ok to implement the lang change by a total page refresh?
2015-04-29T17:33:44 <Bosmon> Does this still seem like the scheme we will choose?
2015-04-29T17:33:47 <Justin_o> Bosmon: we had been talking about that yes
2015-04-29T17:34:07 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i think you have suggested there might be a way around it by just rerendering..
2015-04-29T17:34:08 * michelled has quit
2015-04-29T17:34:11 <Justin_o> is that still possible?
2015-04-29T17:34:24 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I had suggested it yes, but I think that it\'s not actually workable
2015-04-29T17:34:35 * michelled joined the channel
2015-04-29T17:34:42 <Bosmon> Since we would still need to reload the changed message bundles, which with the current framework we would have to do asynchronously
2015-04-29T17:34:44 <Justin_o> Bosmon: ah okay, then yes we should fall back to the page reload
2015-04-29T17:34:55 <Bosmon> And only the top level resource loader is capable of that
2015-04-29T17:34:59 <Justin_o> that will probably have some side effects unfortunately
2015-04-29T17:35:25 <Justin_o> my last comment there was part of my previo0us
2015-04-29T17:35:27 <Bosmon> So I think we should honour a language change by writing the changed language into the stored model and then triggering a refresh
2015-04-29T17:35:37 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay
2015-04-29T17:35:40 <Bosmon> Yes - what side effects are you thinking of?
2015-04-29T17:35:50 <Bosmon> I guess there are some in-memory structures that the app is keeping hold of
2015-04-29T17:36:06 <Bosmon> I notice that the UI model that we have for this interface is very stateful
2015-04-29T17:36:38 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes, i\'m worried that some things might drop their state
2015-04-29T17:37:29 <Bosmon> Justin_o - we will just have to make sure that that state is in the model too, and store it as well
2015-04-29T17:37:38 <Bosmon> One of the advantages of model-based development :)
2015-04-29T17:38:07 <Justin_o> Bosmon: true.. but we\'ll have to track more things like what\'s been changed and etc.
2015-04-29T17:38:19 <Bosmon> Yes
2015-04-29T17:38:45 <Bosmon> But it was unavoidable to track it anyway - and it will make our design more reliable to know exactly what it is
2015-04-29T17:39:14 <Bosmon> But hopefully that\'s just a "quality of implementation" issue, we should be able to demonstrate basic language changing quite quickly
2015-04-29T17:39:28 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes... hopefully
2015-04-29T17:46:55 <Justin_o> cindyli1: I\'ve merged the FLOE-281 pull request

2015-04-29T12:55:52 <Bosmon> Hi there cindyli
2015-04-29T12:55:56 <Bosmon> I found the bug : P
2015-04-29T12:56:02 <cindyli> what\'s about
2015-04-29T12:56:51 <Bosmon> The modelRelay bug
2015-04-29T12:57:16 <cindyli> i know. what\'s the bug
2015-04-29T12:57:21 <Bosmon> oh
2015-04-29T12:57:27 <Bosmon> It is rather complicated to explain :(
2015-04-29T12:57:34 <cindyli> haha
2015-04-29T12:58:01 <Bosmon> It relates to a stupid "safety" feature I put in right at the beginning to prevent certain kinds of infinite relay
2015-04-29T12:58:08 <Bosmon> I actually thought I had got rid of it completely
2015-04-29T12:58:38 <cindyli> ah ha, probably now is a good time to get rid of ;)
2015-04-29T12:58:44 <Bosmon> It prevents any relay from being operated MORE THAN TWO TIMES IN THE SAME DIRECTION in any transaction
2015-04-29T12:58:51 <Bosmon> Which is fine, even in your case
2015-04-29T12:59:00 <Bosmon> Except for a further really unpleasant implementation bug
2015-04-29T12:59:25 <Bosmon> So, "for some reason", the counters which track relay invocation are shared across all transactions
2015-04-29T12:59:41 <Bosmon> Which again, even in your case would still have been fine, even though it is already a bug
2015-04-29T12:59:56 <Bosmon> But "it so happens" that you are firing a further transaction in a listener to the previous one
2015-04-29T13:00:12 <Bosmon> So the test case fixture is entirely driven by the listener to the outgoing change event for the previous transaction
2015-04-29T13:00:26 <Bosmon> And I think, even more, by the one before that as well
2015-04-29T13:00:58 <cindyli> where did I fire "a further transaction in a listener to the previous one"
2015-04-29T13:01:00 <Bosmon> Which implies that the transaction cleanup code for the previous transactions STILL has not run by the time you are making your change of "lang" back to "en" for the last time
2015-04-29T13:01:59 * sepideh joined the channel
2015-04-29T13:02:02 <Bosmon> cindyli - https://github.com/cindyli/first-discovery/blob/FLOE-281/tests/js/panelsTests.js#L110
2015-04-29T13:02:09 <Bosmon> So each of these fixtures are listening to "modelChanged"
2015-04-29T13:02:16 <Bosmon> And what in fact happens is that they all stack up synchronously
2015-04-29T13:02:16 <cindyli> ok
2015-04-29T13:02:26 <Bosmon> Since there is in fact no asynchrony in this test sequence at all
2015-04-29T13:03:02 <Bosmon> So by the time you get to the final stage, you have THREE transactions queued up on the stack, all just ready to finish
2015-04-29T13:03:27 <Bosmon> But none of them has executed their cleanup code yet, so this tips the "relayCount" for the relay rule to equal THREE, and the system then prevents it from operating again
2015-04-29T13:03:38 <cindyli> ok
2015-04-29T13:03:49 <Bosmon> Anyway, I will work on an isolated test case and fix now ......
2015-04-29T13:03:55 <cindyli> thanks
2015-04-29T13:04:12 <Bosmon> I was just too tired to think clearly yesterday

2015-04-29T13:04:41 <Bosmon> Also in the "old framework" it is hard to see that the transactions are stacking up
2015-04-29T13:04:50 * danaayotte joined the channel
2015-04-29T13:04:50 <Bosmon> Since you need to find the instantiator to look in it
2015-04-29T13:05:42 <cindyli> got it.
2015-04-29T13:05:46 <cindyli> btw, hope you had a good rest last night
2015-04-29T13:06:08 <Bosmon> The implementation is still terrible, but it\'s still quicker to spend a day debugging and writing a test case than spending a week or two to rewrite it completely :(
2015-04-29T13:06:14 <Bosmon> But we still need to rewrite it when we can
2015-04-29T13:07:10 <Bosmon> Well, as you know, most of my sleeping is done in the mornings :)
