2015-10-01T21:24:02 <danayo> anastasiac: I like the callout boxes - I wonder, though , if we still need a connection to the specific word? Could we put a smaller green fluid asterisk beside them?
2015-10-01T21:25:12 <alanharnum> anastasiac: new callout design looks really good

2015-10-01T14:55:22 <Justin_o> clown: aria question
2015-10-01T14:55:47 <Justin_o> for the hide/show region.. is it actually necessary to set a role="region" link in this example? http://oaa-accessibility.org/example/20/
2015-10-01T15:00:52 <Justin_o> clown: ^
2015-10-01T15:04:31 <clown> Justin_o:  just saw your question.  It\'s on the stack.
2015-10-01T15:04:44 <Justin_o> clown: thanks
2015-10-01T15:06:31 <clown> avtar, the instructions for turning on 3d acceleration hark back to: http://www.sysprobs.com/install-fedora-16-virtualbox-guest-additions-get-working-gnome-shell-inside-virtual-machine.
2015-10-01T15:06:42 * Jess_ joined the channel
2015-10-01T15:06:55 <clown> that document says that it\'s a combination of 3d accel. + installing the guest addtions.
2015-10-01T15:07:17 <avtar> thanks, clown :D
2015-10-01T15:07:18 <clown> the guest additions had code that took advantage of the 3d accel.
2015-10-01T15:07:33 <clown> whether that still applies \xe2\x80\xa6
2015-10-01T15:07:40 <clown> you\'re welcome avtar.
2015-10-01T15:07:42 <avtar> we\'re going to try a few things in the office with a similar config that gtirloni is using in the data centre
2015-10-01T15:08:22 <avtar> it looks like it\'s kinda working right now without 3d acceleration but i would prefer to match the config what you and other people working on the linux framework are using
2015-10-01T15:11:02 <clown> Justin_o:  the definition of region is changing in ARIA 1.1, and it is more like a landmark:  https://rawgit.com/w3c/aria/master/aria/aria.html#region
2015-10-01T15:13:00 <clown> The oaa example treats it in that way:  it has a heading, the heading is used as the label.
2015-10-01T15:15:10 <clown> But, for the show/hide feature is noted by aria-expanded.  By itself aria-expanded does not require a role="region", Justin_o.
2015-10-01T15:16:55 <clown> aria-expanded is documented here:  https://rawgit.com/w3c/aria/master/aria/aria.html#aria-expanded.
2015-10-01T15:17:07 <clown> note the roles it is "used in".
2015-10-01T15:18:39 <clown> Justin_o, does that answer your question?
2015-10-01T15:19:13 <Justin_o> clown: sort of :)
2015-10-01T15:19:22 <Justin_o> i\'m a bit confused about the roles it\'s used in though
2015-10-01T15:19:26 <Justin_o> section is an abstract role
2015-10-01T15:19:36 <Justin_o> so i don\'t think i should be setting that as the role
2015-10-01T15:19:47 <Justin_o> perhaps region is correct as a landmark though
2015-10-01T15:19:49 <Justin_o> what do you think?
2015-10-01T15:20:02 <Justin_o> if i just make the markup a section, would that be enough?
2015-10-01T15:23:16 <clown> Justin_o:  right, section is abstract, so you can\'t use it.  But, section is a superclass of whole lot of other roles (landmark is one of them).
2015-10-01T15:23:48 <clown> if I had an idea of what the thing you are expanding actually is, it would help.
2015-10-01T15:24:47 <Justin_o> clown: mostly it\'s used for the sliding panel of UI options http://build.fluidproject.org/
2015-10-01T15:25:08 <Justin_o> you can see the display preferences widget on this page
2015-10-01T15:26:38 <clown> Justin_o:  to use the vernacular, that\'s a panel of widget.
2015-10-01T15:26:45 <clown> *widgets
2015-10-01T15:27:53 <clown> First guess:  it\'s like a role="group"  (https://rawgit.com/w3c/aria/master/aria/aria.html#group)
2015-10-01T15:28:09 <clown> *likely
2015-10-01T15:28:17 <clown> Justin_o, I can\'t type today for some reason.

2015-10-01T20:39:40 <avtar> clown: thanks
2015-10-01T20:40:08 <avtar> it looks like gtirloni_ found a nice workaround in the test environment so now 3d acceleration is enabled :D
