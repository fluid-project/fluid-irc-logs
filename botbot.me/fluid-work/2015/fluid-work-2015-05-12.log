b'2015-05-12T17:54:46 <Bosmon> I certainly observed it to work at least once during 2008 :)
2015-05-12T17:55:39 * michelled joined the channel
2015-05-12T17:55:56 <colinclark> What do we mean, specifically, when we talk about a "mixin grade?"
2015-05-12T17:56:02 <colinclark> Aren\'t all grades mixins?
2015-05-12T17:56:10 <Bosmon> colinclark - some grades are more mixins than others :)
2015-05-12T17:56:22 <Bosmon> I guess, more accurately, we might want to talk of "pure mixins"
2015-05-12T17:56:25 <colinclark> I prefer the term "mixiny"
2015-05-12T17:56:36 <Bosmon> Grades which simply couldn\'t be instantiated without being applied to some particular base grade
2015-05-12T17:56:46 <colinclark> ah
2015-05-12T17:57:07 <Bosmon> So the question which simonjb had brought up earlier with respect to the "keyboard input" panel was that he had packaged functionality to make this into a "self-voicing keyboard input panel" grade
2015-05-12T17:57:26 <Bosmon> But this latter, "pure mixin" grade could never (IN THEORY) function without having a "keyboard input panel" to bolt on to
2015-05-12T17:57:33 <colinclark> right
2015-05-12T17:57:43 <Bosmon> But that IN THEORY, in theory, could cover a lot of holes :)
2015-05-12T17:58:15 <colinclark> So, here, a "mixin grade" refers to a grade that is intended to augment some other grade or set of grades
2015-05-12T17:58:30 <colinclark> without specifically referencing it as a parent grade
2015-05-12T17:58:32 <Bosmon> So, one could imagine some kind of INTERMEDIATE CREATOR... who might say, either, that "I hate your keyboard input panel grade entirely and I\'m going to make my own one that works just like it only differently", or else, "I need to get in between your keyboard input panel base grade and your self-voicing mixin grade"
2015-05-12T17:59:04 <Bosmon> Yes, so the issue is, in cases where the "immediate creator" thinks that the mixin grade simply couldn\'t function without a particular base grade, whether they should mention that base grade in the hierarchy of the mixin
2015-05-12T17:59:30 <Bosmon> Our "old-style thinking", probably still heavily influenced by some variety of Java-based OO thinking, thought that the answer should be "yes"
2015-05-12T17:59:41 <colinclark> But you seem to have been arguing for a "best practice" which involves not naming this grade that the mixin depends on
2015-05-12T17:59:49 <colinclark> is that correct?
2015-05-12T17:59:55 <Bosmon> But I think our new best practice is for such mixins to mention as few as possible base grades, and preferably, none at all
2015-05-12T18:00:02 <colinclark> Under the assumption that some other grade may well satisfy the contract
2015-05-12T18:00:04 <Bosmon> colinclark - yes, this is what I am arguing
2015-05-12T18:00:25 <Bosmon> colinclark - yes, either some other grade may satisfy the contract, or a further "intermediate grade" might be interposed between the base and mixin
2015-05-12T18:00:32 <colinclark> ok
2015-05-12T18:00:41 <Bosmon> We don\'t really believe in "coercion and blame" as the rest of the community does :)
2015-05-12T18:00:45 <colinclark> lol
2015-05-12T18:00:56 <Bosmon> "Anything that could happen, should happen" is more our tune
2015-05-12T18:01:03 <Bosmon> CHAOS OF THE KIND WE WANT : P
2015-05-12T18:01:06 <colinclark> :)
2015-05-12T18:01:13 <colinclark> I guess this is an interesting issue
2015-05-12T18:01:27 <colinclark> since it puts pressure on "non-technical contracts"
2015-05-12T18:01:29 <colinclark> such as documentation
2015-05-12T18:01:42 <colinclark> to articulate how a thing is intended, at least originally, to be used
2015-05-12T18:01:52 <Bosmon> I was telling simonjb about the time I had to assess how much of the Hibernate source code I had to duplicate in order to make a small tweak to one function body, based on the fact that all their implementation methods and classes were marked as "final"
2015-05-12T18:02:00 <Bosmon> In the end it was looking something like 30 or 40 classes
2015-05-12T18:02:05 <colinclark> jeez
2015-05-12T18:02:09 <colinclark> that\'s insane
2015-05-12T18:02:24 <Bosmon> Our aim is to minimise the number of things that an "eccentric integrator" might have to duplicate, if they decide they like "some but not all" of our implementation
2015-05-12T18:02:44 <colinclark> OUR AIM IS TO EMPOWER ECCENTRIC INTEGRATORS
2015-05-12T18:02:54 <Bosmon> And writing extra base grades in mixins definitely increases that number
2015-05-12T18:03:00 <Bosmon> Yes, those
2015-05-12T18:03:02 <colinclark> I think that\'s perfectly reasonable in principle
2015-05-12T18:03:08 <Bosmon> Certainly noone else empowers them :)
2015-05-12T18:03:32 <Bosmon> But the FIRST thing one finds, invariably, when looking at some foreign source code, is that one immediately wants to do something that the original author would have characterised as "eccentric"
2015-05-12T18:03:53 <colinclark> but again, it emphases a somewhat missing role for something that tells Eccentric Integrators, and those less so, about what kind of shapes fit in the missing spots in the mixin grade
2015-05-12T18:04:01 <Bosmon> colinclark - yes, it does
2015-05-12T18:04:16 <colinclark> It reminds a bit of my comment to you offchannel last night
2015-05-12T18:04:18 <Bosmon> But then we never believed in having a TYPE SYSTEM anyway : P
2015-05-12T18:04:24 <simonjb> unit tests can help a little
2015-05-12T18:04:28 <colinclark> where I had a grade that was just sort of "randomly" referring to components int he tree
2015-05-12T18:04:33 <colinclark> simonjb: yes, it\'s true
2015-05-12T18:04:49 <colinclark> and I guess we can imagine some kind of semi-formal annotations in the grade definition
2015-05-12T18:04:57 <colinclark> as comments or whatever
2015-05-12T18:04:59 <Bosmon> One day we, though, will have a kind of "TYPE SYSTEM"
2015-05-12T18:05:07 <Bosmon> Which will let users see these things
2015-05-12T18:05:13 <Bosmon> Until we have that, we will have DOCUMENTATION
2015-05-12T18:05:25 <colinclark> our achilles heel
2015-05-12T18:05:28 <simonjb> for example for my keyboardInput, I have: tests for keyboardInput and then tests that verify that a keyboardInput + speakign mixin is still a good keyboardInput as well as a good speaking keyboardInput
2015-05-12T18:05:39 <colinclark> right
2015-05-12T18:05:46 <Bosmon> That is, for example, the system will be able to automatically tell you, given any such pure mixin grade, which base grades in the system would be able to make the resulting grade instantiable
2015-05-12T18:05:47 <Bosmon> OR
2015-05-12T18:05:54 <colinclark> that is probably the best and first best practice to encourage for now, simonjb
2015-05-12T18:06:01 <Bosmon> Correspondingly, given any other kind of "incomplete grade", WHERE in a component tree it could be successfully instantiated
2015-05-12T18:06:06 <Bosmon> We will be able to do this IN CLOSED FORM!
2015-05-12T18:06:10 <Bosmon> Using our PARTIAL INSTANTIATION MODEL
2015-05-12T18:06:27 <colinclark> I was saying, but then forgot...
2015-05-12T18:06:34 <colinclark> How I mentioned to you last night, Bosmon
2015-05-12T18:06:42 <colinclark> the apparent shadiness of a grade i had written
2015-05-12T18:06:46 <Bosmon> simonjb - yes, test cases are completely essential
2015-05-12T18:06:55 <colinclark> which just sort of "randomly" made reference to another component that I knew was in the tree
2015-05-12T18:07:07 <colinclark> and thus served as part of the contract of that grade actually working
2015-05-12T18:07:14 <Bosmon> simonjb - even in "classic OO", there was never any guarantee (Liskov notwithstanding) that any extension of a base class still usefully maintained any of its invariants
2015-05-12T18:07:25 <colinclark> and it seemed so shady to me just because of how "sedimented" tHAT S21``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
2015-05-12T18:07:29 <colinclark> the cat has interrupted me
2015-05-12T18:07:31 <Bosmon> So there could never be a viable world in which test cases didn\'t take up this slack
2015-05-12T18:07:34 <Bosmon> WOWOWOWWOW
2015-05-12T18:07:39 <simonjb> Bosmon: yes, absolutely, agreed
2015-05-12T18:07:41 <colinclark> how hidden that kind of contract is
2015-05-12T18:07:42 <Bosmon> POWERFULL ESS TWENTY ONE interrupting CATTE :)
2015-05-12T18:07:52 <Bosmon> colinclark - well, it\'s not all THAT hidden
2015-05-12T18:08:02 <colinclark> it\'s pretty obscure
2015-05-12T18:08:03 <Bosmon> Since one can see it .... in the.... CONFIGGURATION :)
2015-05-12T18:08:09 <colinclark> to just have a name sitting around
2015-05-12T18:08:13 <Bosmon> Well sure
2015-05-12T18:08:16 <colinclark> but I guess this is more intellectual baggage
2015-05-12T18:08:18 <Bosmon> We used to consider it shady for a long time
2015-05-12T18:08:47 <Bosmon> Much for the same reason that that villain HOYT with his book "let over lambda" introduced shady constructions such as the injection of fresh free variables into already existing closures : P
2015-05-12T18:09:02 <Bosmon> but in fact such "interactional grades", we eventually decided, are part of the core strength of our system
2015-05-12T18:09:04 <colinclark> lol
2015-05-12T18:09:27 <Bosmon> Assuming, as you say, we develop corresponding tools and working practices in order to manage them
2015-05-12T18:09:43 <colinclark> But how, practically, is some sort of user of my grade supposed to know that I am randomly expecting there to be something named "{animator}" kicking around somewhere?
2015-05-12T18:09:44 <Bosmon> But, in practice, should a user try to use your "incomplete grade", they\'ll get an immediate diagnostic telling them what is missing
2015-05-12T18:09:46 <Bosmon> If anything
2015-05-12T18:09:51 <Bosmon> colinclark - YOU WILL TELL THEM :)
2015-05-12T18:10:28 <Bosmon> It\'s a funny new community dynamic :)
2015-05-12T18:10:30 <Bosmon> Telling people things : P
2015-05-12T18:10:33 <colinclark> lokl
2015-05-12T18:10:35 <colinclark> lol
2015-05-12T18:10:51 <colinclark> I guess it would be really nice to annotate my component somehow
2015-05-12T18:10:52 <Bosmon> It reminds me of my very smart friend Felix\' first reaction around 2009 when I told him that we had decided to move entirely in favour of using public members and functions
2015-05-12T18:11:07 <colinclark> even to the point where the diagnostic might be able to report that information
2015-05-12T18:11:13 <Bosmon> He said.... "But what would you do if they changed something which had been a private member of your component that then stopped it working"
2015-05-12T18:11:20 <Bosmon> And I replied, "Well, you would just tell them not to do that"
2015-05-12T18:11:29 <Bosmon> At which point he shook his head at me in a very disappointed fashion :)
2015-05-12T18:12:00 <Bosmon> colinclark - yes - what you want.... is..... TYPES :)
2015-05-12T18:12:03 <Bosmon> We\'ll have them in the end
2015-05-12T18:12:08 <Bosmon> But not before we have built our own IDE
2015-05-12T18:13:06 <colinclark> A long row we hoe
2015-05-12T18:13:20 <Bosmon> Brussels Sprouts at every turn
2015-05-12T18:14:02 <Bosmon> I guess we could add some extra "holes" in defaults blocks.... at least, for these kinds of comments attached to these "holes"
2015-05-12T18:14:24 <Bosmon> That way, when the framework issues a diagnostic about a failed dependency, it could fish out your comment and then trail it in front of the user
2015-05-12T18:14:51 <Bosmon> Since of course there\'s no point annotating THAT the grade requires a thing called {animator} since that can instantly be determined from the configuration
2015-05-12T18:15:00 <Bosmon> But what could usefully be explained is, WHAT an {animator} is, and why
2015-05-12T18:15:09 <Bosmon> And at least some examples of where the user could lay their hands on one
2015-05-12T18:15:12 <colinclark> yes, exactly
2015-05-12T18:15:22 <colinclark> and particular what aspect of animator-ness is needed
2015-05-12T18:15:36 <colinclark> sorry, i\'m terribly ungrammatical today
2015-05-12T18:15:41 <colinclark> but hopefully you know what i mean
2015-05-12T18:15:54 <Bosmon> Yes - although if there was a subaspect of it, that might be better expressed through factorising the {animator} reference itself into a reference to a subgrade
2015-05-12T18:16:19 <Bosmon> Then you imagine that there would be parallel series of animatorRequestor grades, running together with the animator grades
2015-05-12T18:16:34 <colinclark> ah yes
2015-05-12T18:16:36 <Bosmon> Anyone who had made configuration which was "missing" an animator would derive from the "requestor" grade which held the annotation
2015-05-12T18:16:55 <Bosmon> "GRADES AND ANTI-GRADES"
2015-05-12T18:17:07 <Bosmon> "This grade represents the asbence of the following grade" : P
2015-05-12T18:17:11 <Bosmon> absence
2015-05-12T18:19:31 <colinclark> :)
2015-05-12T18:20:09 <Bosmon> I\'m sure my friend HORTTEYYEARD would have some scheme for representing this within his wacky formalism of "coeffects" .......
2015-05-12T18:21:55 <Justin_o> Bosmon, colinclark: michelled and I are planning on doing a community meeting regarding self voicing on June 24th, do you both think you can make it for that?
2015-05-12T18:22:12 <colinclark> I think I will be around, yes
2015-05-12T18:22:27 <colinclark> that\'s just between my vacation and my trip to Copenhagen for the GPII architecture meetings
2015-05-12T18:22:51 <Bosmon> All I see in my calendar for that day is "granny squares" : P
2015-05-12T18:22:53 <michelled> good timing Justin_o  :)
2015-05-12T18:24:37 <colinclark> what are granny squares? :P
2015-05-12T18:26:12 <Bosmon> Google images seems to be clear enough :)
2015-05-12T18:27:51 <Justin_o> Bosmon: but does that mean you\'re busy or free?
2015-05-12T18:27:56 <colinclark> oh yes, I know what those are
2015-05-12T18:28:06 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I imagine I\'ll be free
2015-05-12T18:28:16 <Justin_o> Bosmon: great :)

2015-05-12T14:10:00 <jhung> anastasiac: if the new text for the show sounds enactor is "Do you want the screen to flash when a sound is played?". What do think the tool tip text should be?
2015-05-12T14:10:16 <anastasiac> hm
2015-05-12T14:10:38 * anastasiac checking tooltips for tts
2015-05-12T14:11:49 <anastasiac> jhung, how about \xe2\x80\x9cSelect to turn screen flashing on(off)\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cscreen flashing is on(off)\xe2\x80\x9d ?

2015-05-12T14:13:29 <jhung> anastasiac: Do you think we should add a little more context? i.e. how about "flash screen for sounds on/off" and "select to turn flash screens for sounds on/off"?

2015-05-12T14:16:01 <anastasiac> jhung, yes, more context is better. let\xe2\x80\x99s see how big the tooltips look with all that text in them
2015-05-12T14:16:09 <jhung> ok anastasiac
2015-05-12T14:22:06 <jhung> anastasiac, Justin_o, cindyli - I have updated the wireframe for the FD tool. You can find it here http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Design+Sketches under "First Discovery for June 2015\xe2\x80\xa6"
2015-05-12T14:22:14 <anastasiac> thanks, jhung
2015-05-12T14:22:25 <jhung> np anastasiac let me know if there\'s anything else.

2015-05-12T15:03:47 <kasparnet> yes
2015-05-12T15:04:00 <Bosmon> "yes" is not a place, KASPARDNITT :)
2015-05-12T15:04:19 <kasparnet> oh
2015-05-12T15:04:27 <kasparnet> I was lazy and just read "are we meeting?"
2015-05-12T15:04:28 <kasparnet> :D
2015-05-12T15:04:41 <colinclark> lol
2015-05-12T15:04:51 <colinclark> WE ARE MEETING IN THE POSITIVE SPACE

2015-05-12T15:05:16 <colinclark> positive vibes will radiate
2015-05-12T15:05:23 <colinclark> we will bask in the ubiquitous yes
2015-05-12T15:05:26 <Bosmon> I ADMIRE YOUR POSITIVE ATTITUDE, FATHER JACK!
2015-05-12T15:05:39 <Bosmon> THAT WOULD BE AN ECUMENICAL MATTER!
2015-05-12T15:05:43 <Bosmon> YES!
2015-05-12T15:06:21 <colinclark> These are Father Ted quotes
2015-05-12T15:06:59 <kasparnet> ok - let\'s do vidyo
2015-05-12T15:07:18 <colinclark> We might overlap with standup
2015-05-12T15:07:19 <kasparnet> my room
2015-05-12T15:07:21 <colinclark> cool
2015-05-12T15:07:22 <simonjb> your room, kasparnet?
2015-05-12T15:07:23 <colinclark> that\'ll work
2015-05-12T15:07:41 <simonjb> yes

2015-05-12T17:37:24 <cindyli> Justin_o: can you review my pull request - https://github.com/fluid-project/first-discovery/pull/44
2015-05-12T17:39:40 <cindyli> Justin_o: i\'m thinking the next thing for me to work on is to save the state info into the central model. what do you think?
2015-05-12T17:39:56 <Justin_o> cindyli: sounds good
2015-05-12T17:40:01 <Justin_o> and i\'ll look at your pull request soon
2015-05-12T17:40:17 <cindyli> thanks, Justin_o
2015-05-12T17:41:40 <Bosmon> Small pul for you, colinclark :)
2015-05-12T17:41:41 <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/601
2015-05-12T17:42:34 <Bosmon> cindyli, Justin_o - thinking more about my comments on persisting focus - I think in fact that the big framework branch won\'t help much with this so you should feel free to tackle it whenever you think it is relevant
2015-05-12T17:43:14 <cindyli> good to know. thanks, Bosmon
2015-05-12T17:43:40 <Bosmon> Although all the schemes I can think of are still rather wacky :)
2015-05-12T17:43:52 <Bosmon> This might actually be a use case for the so-far disused "#" syntax for distributeOptions
2015-05-12T17:44:05 <Bosmon> Which I suspect doesn\'t really work at the moment
2015-05-12T17:44:10 <Justin_o> Bosmon: what does that do?
2015-05-12T17:44:40 <Bosmon> Justin_o - it was meant to select a component based on its id
2015-05-12T17:44:48 <Bosmon> But I never thought of a realistic use case for it until now
2015-05-12T17:45:05 <Justin_o> Bosmon: oh from it\'s DOM id or it\'s IoC one?
2015-05-12T17:45:05 <Bosmon> And now I have the use case, I see that the current implementation is useless : P
2015-05-12T17:45:10 <Bosmon> Justin_o - the IoC one
2015-05-12T17:45:31 <Bosmon> The idea is that we would "stably identify" which node has focus based on the pair of (component id, DOM binder name)
2015-05-12T17:45:50 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i\'m guess we couldn\'t use it in this case because the id would change every page load
2015-05-12T17:45:59 <Justin_o> the unique part at the front anyways
2015-05-12T17:46:00 <Bosmon> We would make a global focus listener that watches for all focus changes in the document, and constantly stores in a particular model these pair of strings
2015-05-12T17:46:09 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, it is the unique part at the front that is the stumbling block
2015-05-12T17:46:11 * sepideh joined the channel
2015-05-12T17:46:22 <Bosmon> but now we have a use case, it\'s clear that the the # selector should work based on simply the numeric part of the id
2015-05-12T17:47:08 <Bosmon> Given we currently still have a synchronous framework (which is very annoying in other ways), we can at least be certain that the ids are allocated in a deterministic way between runs
2015-05-12T17:47:14 <Justin_o> Bosmon: wouldn\'t that be brittle especially in the case of asynchrony
2015-05-12T17:47:23 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes - but we currently don\'t have any :)
2015-05-12T17:47:30 <Justin_o> Bosmon: :)
2015-05-12T17:47:43 <Justin_o> Bosmon: but it could/would break if we were to reconfigure the component
2015-05-12T17:47:51 <Justin_o> e.g. add/remove a sub component
2015-05-12T17:48:07 <Bosmon> Justin_o, that\'s true - if the component were recreated as a result of being re-rendered, the id would change
2015-05-12T17:48:31 <Bosmon> So perhaps this suggests that the other approach I had in mind, based on component path, is more viable
2015-05-12T17:49:03 <Bosmon> I guess there\'s no reason we can\'t do that right now - especially since without the global instantiator, the component path is even more stable
2015-05-12T17:49:24 <Bosmon> We can use a utility like the one I wrote for ADTKINS a couple of months ago
2015-05-12T17:49:50 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i don\'t think i saw that one
2015-05-12T17:49:55 <Justin_o> is that in infusion?
2015-05-12T17:49:58 <Bosmon> Justin_o - it\'s here
2015-05-12T17:49:58 <Bosmon> https://github.com/GPII/gpii-express/blob/master/src/js/express.js#L13
2015-05-12T17:50:34 <Bosmon> It relies on undocumented features of the framework but it should be pretty stable
2015-05-12T17:50:40 <Bosmon> It will still work in the "new framework" for example
2015-05-12T17:50:50 <Bosmon> Although in that case it will produce paths which are one level deeper
2015-05-12T17:51:46 <Bosmon> So, the "focus persister" will be a mixin grade which can be added to every viewComponent which wants focus state preserved on any DOM node which is known in its DOM binder
2015-05-12T17:52:04 <Bosmon> This is actually something which the renderer used to make some efforts to try to do
2015-05-12T17:52:17 <Bosmon> But that support probably hasn\'t worked or been tested for many years
2015-05-12T17:52:50 <Bosmon> This is just a "larger-scale" version of the same idea - rather than just persisting focus across a block of markup being destroyed and re-rendered, we want to persist focus to a complete refresh of the same page
2015-05-12T17:52:53 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yah, i don\'t think it maintains focus, at least i haven\'t observed that recently
2015-05-12T17:53:09 <Justin_o> cindyli: ^
2015-05-12T17:53:33 <Bosmon> Justin_o - well, it\'s trying at least : P https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/renderer/js/fluidRenderer.js#L1492
2015-05-12T17:54:00 <Bosmon> I guess it no longer works because we no longer use "reRender" for rerendering
2015-05-12T17:54:07 <Bosmon> But instead completely destroy and recreate the holding component
2015-05-12T17:54:18 <Bosmon> Well
2015-05-12T17:54:40 <Bosmon> I guess the top-level component might still remain fixed..... in any case, there is some kind of precedent for this algorithm
