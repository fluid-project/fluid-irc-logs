2015-02-11T14:32:25 <jhung> ok anastasiac. I\'ll take a look

2015-02-11T15:26:36 <Bosmon> jhernandez: VVVERNNANDDEZZZ!
2015-02-11T15:27:08 <anastasiac> Justin_o, cindyli: the icon font work has been merged, so you might want to update whatever branch you\xe2\x80\x99re working on and make sure I didn\xe2\x80\x99t disrupt anything you\xe2\x80\x99re doing

2015-02-11T15:43:32 <sgithens______> Is there an arch meeting today with all the Stuttgart meetings happening?
2015-02-11T15:45:53 <Bosmon> I would expect not
2015-02-11T15:46:06 <Bosmon> Also sbates is away
2015-02-11T15:51:05 <sgithens______> grate
2015-02-11T15:51:21 <sgithens______> unless someone says otherwise here, I will probably not show up today
2015-02-11T15:51:39 <sgithens______> as a quick status to the channel, I am supremely focussed on GPII-12 right now!
2015-02-11T15:51:43 <sgithens______> Until I finish it
2015-02-11T15:52:02 <sgithens______> since we can\'t ship LGS boxes next month with people running as admin
2015-02-11T15:52:20 <jhernandez> I will also NOT be on the arch meeting - I have some family duties ...
2015-02-11T15:52:31 <jhernandez> Bosmon: ANTVANIQQQQQEE!!
2015-02-11T15:52:37 <sgithens______> !!!!!!!!

2015-02-11T15:57:51 <jhernandez> Bosmon: wrt my "bonjour" - I was trying to understand how our testing mocks work in order to include mocks for our dynamic device reporters
2015-02-11T16:01:19 <jhernandez> and now that I understand them I\'m figuring out the best way to mock the dynamic device reporters

2015-02-11T16:32:35 <Bosmon> jhernandez - so our mocks work via the "nameResolver" system

2015-02-11T16:53:40 <Bosmon> jhernandez - the best way to mock them is to just connect them to some files like the static files we have already
2015-02-11T16:53:47 <Bosmon> That we will place in testData for this purpose
2015-02-11T17:03:30 <clown> jhernandez, Bosmon:  is the conclusion that there is no arch telecon today?
2015-02-11T17:03:43 <Bosmon> I think there will be none

2015-02-11T17:28:38 <michelled> lliskovoi: do you have a link to the accessibility sprint site design?
2015-02-11T17:29:02 <lliskovoi> michelled Here is the most recent version: https://www.dropbox.com/s/b6tnii0p6zr418u/OER%20Accessibility%20Sprint%20Website%20mockup_C.pdf?dl=0
2015-02-11T17:31:09 <michelled> thanks!
2015-02-11T17:34:57 <jhung> Hi lliskovoi. I took at look at the design. It\'s very nice! But I have some questions.
2015-02-11T17:35:12 <lliskovoi> ask away
2015-02-11T17:35:37 <jhung> Is there a mobile design for this site? If the screen is very wide, what would that look like?
2015-02-11T17:36:20 <lliskovoi> There isn\'t a mobile design at this stage, I was planning on getting started on that once the web version is approved
2015-02-11T17:37:06 <jhung> Also I assume the Agenda and Parts & Attendees parts aren\'t done yet\xe2\x80\xa6 but if you can put in some placeholders that would help in developing it.
2015-02-11T17:37:46 <lliskovoi> Absolutely
2015-02-11T17:38:45 <lliskovoi> I can mockup a rough mobile version today and add some placeholder content to the two empty sections
2015-02-11T17:40:28 <jhung> That\'d be great lliskovoi! This way I can raise any technical issues with the design before starting to build it.
2015-02-11T17:41:58 <lliskovoi> Sounds good. I\'m not here Thursday/Friday but please feel free to email me at lisa.liskovoi@gmail.com any time between now and Monday if you have any time-sensitive questions.
2015-02-11T17:43:51 <jhung> lliskovoi: thanks! But I\'m sure there will be enough to start on anyway with you having to answer emails on your day off. :)
2015-02-11T17:45:12 <lliskovoi> haha, sounds good, but just in case
