2015-10-30T11:33:05 <andresmalarres> and it worked
2015-10-30T11:33:15 <andresmalarres> pheeew

2015-10-30T11:36:07 <andresmalarres> i thought that git status was telling me that everything was updated
2015-10-30T11:36:21 <andresmalarres> but my windows repo lacked a git pull
2015-10-30T11:36:37 <andresmalarres> now my "official" gpii installation works as well
