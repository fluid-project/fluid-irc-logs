2015-09-22T14:05:31 <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks i\'ll take a look at those this morning and look at your pull request too
2015-09-22T14:05:42 <cindyli> thanks, Justin_o
2015-09-22T14:17:20 <colinclark> Justin_o: So the straight up ctrl-* key combination worked on Chrome with VoiceOver for you?
2015-09-22T14:18:38 <Justin_o> yes, did that work okay for you?
2015-09-22T14:19:22 <colinclark> I haven\'t had a chance to try it with VoiceOver, but just wanted to confirm that I understood your email properly
2015-09-22T14:19:29 * anastasiac joined the channel
2015-09-22T14:19:30 <colinclark> glad to hear that it works :)
2015-09-22T14:19:31 <colinclark> and thanks for testing it and responding
2015-09-22T14:19:54 <Justin_o> no problem
2015-09-22T14:20:09 <Justin_o> colinclark: now that I have you here.
2015-09-22T14:20:24 <Justin_o> colinclark: regarding yesterdays meeting about FD and serving it.
2015-09-22T14:20:35 <colinclark> yup
2015-09-22T14:20:47 * clown joined the channel
2015-09-22T14:21:01 <Justin_o> would the idea be to take the existing repo and modify it so that the FD Tool is in an express app or some other server.
2015-09-22T14:21:19 <Justin_o> or would it be too create a new server repo, that some how pulls in the FD Tool and serves it up
2015-09-22T14:21:36 <colinclark> I guess you have those two options, yes
2015-09-22T14:21:51 <colinclark> Your server could depend on the FD tool as an npm module, right?
2015-09-22T14:22:12 <Justin_o> yes, that\'s what i was thinking.. provided i can get to the files to server properly
2015-09-22T14:22:17 <Justin_o> i think this would be more flexible though
2015-09-22T14:22:30 <colinclark> it seems reasonable enough
2015-09-22T14:22:48 <Justin_o> cool i\'ll start with that
2015-09-22T14:22:54 <colinclark> but I don\'t think it\'s a big deal either way
2015-09-22T14:22:59 <colinclark> worth a shot, anyway
2015-09-22T14:23:16 <Justin_o> yah, true.. thanks
2015-09-22T14:24:16 <colinclark> any time

2015-09-22T15:49:30 <cindyli> thanks
2015-09-22T15:54:14 <alanharnum> Justin_o: he refuses to sign a collaboration agreement no matter how many times I ask
2015-09-22T15:54:40 <alanharnum> excuses ranging from "does not have opposable thumbs to hold pen" to "does not understand open-source licensing due to being a cat"
2015-09-22T15:55:12 <Justin_o> this doesn\'t just happen to cats "does not understand open-source licensing "
2015-09-22T16:02:41 <Justin_o> cindyli: O
2015-09-22T16:02:50 <Justin_o> cindyli: I\'ve merged in FLUID-5770

2015-09-22T17:13:55 <simonjb> hey alanharnum, thanks for your email, I would likely install GPII manually myself as I want to install custom code
2015-09-22T17:14:19 <simonjb> I\'ve got one of our other Surfaces, so maybe it makes sense just to use that one
2015-09-22T17:14:22 <alanharnum> simonjb: ok - based on what we saw, the Surface seems to work just fine
2015-09-22T17:14:45 <alanharnum> I don\'t think there\'s a difference in OS on a Surface Pro vs. a Windows 8 desktop/laptop
2015-09-22T17:15:04 <alanharnum> but admit near-full ignorance about the Surface as a class of product
2015-09-22T17:15:38 <simonjb> alanharnum: and you didn\'t test NFC or RFID?
2015-09-22T17:16:44 <simonjb> alanharnum: are the RFID reader/tags also in your locker?
2015-09-22T17:17:15 <alanharnum> simonjb: those are in a common locker that Justin_o should have the key to - if not avtar can show you where the spare key is
2015-09-22T17:17:27 <simonjb> ok, thanks alanharnum
2015-09-22T17:17:42 <alanharnum> the Surface Pro 3 has no built-in NFC/RFID unfortunately :(
2015-09-22T17:18:14 <alanharnum> or more precisely, the wireless chip is NFC capable, but not enabled
2015-09-22T17:18:20 <simonjb> got it
