b'2015-08-27T20:51:13 <avtar> i\'ll specify the version
2015-08-27T20:52:05 <clown> avatar, okay.  However, I just checked virtual box for mac, and version 5 is only for amd64.  I don\'t believe I can upgrade (there is no x64 version yet).  Unless you know otherwise.
2015-08-27T20:52:20 * clown curses his client for "fixing" the spelling.
2015-08-27T20:52:25 <clown> avtar ^
2015-08-27T20:54:14 <clown> avtar, I just tried "Check for updates" from with VB, and it says I am running the latest version (4.3.30).  You might specify "at least version x.xx" in your readme
2015-08-27T20:55:22 <avtar> clown: amd64 implies 64 bit
2015-08-27T20:56:11 <avtar> x86 would be 32 bit
2015-08-27T20:56:29 <avtar> but your installed version should suffice

2015-08-27T15:59:54 <alanharnum> Justin_o simonjb: do either of you mind giving this final document a quick once-over before I turn it over?
2015-08-27T16:00:27 <simonjb> alanharnum: I can definitely take a look
2015-08-27T16:00:35 <alanharnum> great thanks simonjb
2015-08-27T16:00:39 <alanharnum> will forward
2015-08-27T16:00:42 <simonjb> thanks
2015-08-27T16:02:10 <Justin_o> alanharnum: did you still need me to take a look too?
2015-08-27T16:03:29 <alanharnum> Justin_o: I think simonjb\'s eyes are good enough unless you really want :)
2015-08-27T16:03:38 <Justin_o> no thanks :)
2015-08-27T16:03:42 <alanharnum> just want a second set of eyes to make sure i haven\'t left key sections blank :P

2015-08-27T16:10:11 <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: what do you think about using workflow triggers in jira
2015-08-27T16:10:12 <Justin_o> https://confluence.atlassian.com/jira/configuring-workflow-triggers-656539662.html
2015-08-27T16:10:52 <anastasiac> interesting...
2015-08-27T16:11:09 <Justin_o> i\'m particularly interested in using the pull request created and pull request merged events to manage the states of Needs Commit ( wich we could change to pull request or something ) and closed.
2015-08-27T16:11:15 <Justin_o> or maybe resolved
2015-08-27T16:14:10 <anastasiac> yes, that was my first thought, Justin_o
2015-08-27T16:18:17 <Justin_o> colinclark, gtirloni, Bosmon: any thoughts ^
2015-08-27T16:18:31 <anastasiac> Justin_o: I\xe2\x80\x99ve issued a pull request for the \xe2\x80\x98minimal prefs editor\xe2\x80\x99: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/629
2015-08-27T16:18:48 <colinclark> sounds like it would be very useful, Justin_o
2015-08-27T16:21:50 * jessm_ joined the channel
2015-08-27T16:22:43 <Justin_o> anastasiac: thanks i\'ll take a look at that. In terms of best practices though. I don\'t really know all that has changed since the big pull request was merged. So I may be a bit out of date, but I\'ll give it a shot.
2015-08-27T16:22:55 <Justin_o> colinclark: okay, i\'ll look into what it entails then
2015-08-27T16:22:58 <Justin_o> to add them
2015-08-27T16:23:25 * jessm has quit
2015-08-27T16:30:34 <colinclark> Justin_o: Tell me about your standup update
2015-08-27T16:30:51 <colinclark> and the issue of pull requests and updating the chart authoring tool to Infusion master
2015-08-27T16:31:55 * alanharnum joined the channel
2015-08-27T16:34:37 <Justin_o> colinclark: here are the pull requests against the chartAuthoring tool
2015-08-27T16:34:37 <Justin_o> https://github.com/fluid-project/chartAuthoring/pulls
2015-08-27T16:34:45 <Justin_o> FLOE-411 is an update to infusion
2015-08-27T16:34:50 <Justin_o> update of infusion
2015-08-27T16:35:38 <Justin_o> seems FLOE-404 has already been updated with the changes from FLOE-411 so it is just my FLOE-399 branch that still needs to be updated
2015-08-27T16:36:01 <Justin_o> my concern was around having pull request that would need to be updated and what order to do the merge in
2015-08-27T16:40:27 <colinclark> ah, ok
2015-08-27T16:40:49 <colinclark> so you want your FLOE-399 reviewed and merged if possible first, right?

2015-08-27T16:52:17 <anastasiac> thanks, Justin_o
2015-08-27T17:19:49 <Justin_o> Bosmon: do you have a thought on how hard it will be to update FLOE-399 to use the latest infusion?
2015-08-27T17:20:00 <Justin_o> and should the infusion upgrade go in before or after the FLOE-399 pull
2015-08-27T17:20:38 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I\'m not quite sure what you mean
2015-08-27T17:20:43 <Bosmon> The infusion upgrade is already in trunk
2015-08-27T17:21:03 * danayo has quit
2015-08-27T17:21:32 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i mean for the chartAuthoring tool
2015-08-27T17:21:48 <Justin_o> Bosmon: cindy has a pull request to update the version of infusion we use there
2015-08-27T17:22:17 <Bosmon> Oh yes, sorry, I misread the pull request
2015-08-27T17:23:17 <Bosmon> I thought I remembered you saying yesterday that there was a pull against infusion....
2015-08-27T17:24:04 <Justin_o> Bosmon: hmm.. don\'t recall... but i did ping you on an infusion pull request yesterday and was asking you if you were going to be upgrading the pull to work with latest infusion
2015-08-27T17:24:27 <Justin_o> it\'s one of Kaye\'s, she\'s finished her internship with us
2015-08-27T17:25:45 <Justin_o> Bosmon: can we chat more about your comment on FLOE-399 about the reduce functions
2015-08-27T17:26:27 <Bosmon> Justin_o - sure
2015-08-27T17:26:37 <Justin_o> thanks
2015-08-27T17:27:01 <Justin_o> so you were saying i should essentially replace sumDataEntries with reduceAdd from the tests.
2015-08-27T17:27:12 <Justin_o> in sumDataEntries https://github.com/jobara/chartAuthoring/blob/FLOE-399/src/js/dataEntryPanel.js#L151-L159
2015-08-27T17:27:27 <Justin_o> it also has to ensure that the value is correct, at times we may have null/undefined values in there
2015-08-27T17:27:56 * avtar joined the channel
2015-08-27T17:28:21 <Justin_o> also i\'m not sure where you were suggesting to run the fluid.transform or fluid.getMemebers as this is used by the modelRelay https://github.com/jobara/chartAuthoring/blob/FLOE-399/src/js/dataEntryPanel.js#L60-L66
2015-08-27T17:32:23 * colinclark joined the channel
2015-08-27T17:33:07 <Justin_o> Bosmon: ^
2015-08-27T17:35:41 <Bosmon> Justin_o - you could improve the implementation of the "gpii.chartAuthoring.transforms.reduce" function to accept the member extraction operation as a further piece of configuration
2015-08-27T17:37:07 <Justin_o> as a path i guess
2015-08-27T17:37:16 <Justin_o> okay.. that should be doable
2015-08-27T17:37:55 <Justin_o> i guess id\' have to leave the rest of the logic (the portion in the conditional) in place to handle the null/undefined values
2015-08-27T17:38:03 <Justin_o> https://github.com/jobara/chartAuthoring/blob/FLOE-399/src/js/dataEntryPanel.js#L154-L158
2015-08-27T17:43:48 <Justin_o> Bosmon: ^
2015-08-27T17:44:13 <Bosmon> Justin_o - that logic should go into the extractor too
2015-08-27T17:44:17 <Bosmon> And transform those values to zeros
2015-08-27T17:44:32 * Jess_ joined the channel
2015-08-27T17:45:55 <Justin_o> Bosmon: so you are thinking the extra is another function provided to the transformation?
2015-08-27T17:46:04 <Justin_o> extraction not extra
2015-08-27T17:46:10 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes
2015-08-27T17:46:32 <Bosmon> This will mean that you don\'t have to build the same value-extraction and null-checking logic into every accumulator you want to use
2015-08-27T17:54:04 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay, i added this comment on the pull request. does it seem correct https://github.com/fluid-project/chartAuthoring/pull/3#discussion_r38125097
2015-08-27T17:57:19 * danayo joined the channel
2015-08-27T17:57:42 <Bosmon> Justin_o - looks good, yes
