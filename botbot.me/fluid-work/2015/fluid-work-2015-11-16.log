2015-11-16T20:47:10 <anastasiac> jhung, you missed one of my comments - an unfinished sentence describing the POET tool
2015-11-16T20:47:41 <jhung> ok
2015-11-16T20:48:37 <jhung> anastasiac: I checked and I fixed that. It was just a missing period.
2015-11-16T20:49:07 <jhung> Let me check to see if that fix got pushed
2015-11-16T20:51:32 <jhung> Got it anastasiac. The fix needed to be in two places and I only got one of them.
2015-11-16T20:51:39 <jhung> I pushed my change.
2015-11-16T20:51:58 <anastasiac> thanks
2015-11-16T21:05:16 <anastasiac> jhung, the ildh is looking good! just a few more small comments
2015-11-16T21:05:34 <jhung> anastasiac: Thanks. Working on it now.
2015-11-16T21:20:47 <jhung> anastasiac: I've finished my edits.

2015-11-16T21:24:26 <anastasiac> alanharnum, cindyli: Any ETA for getting the shiny chartAuthoring demo pushed?
2015-11-16T21:24:47 <alanharnum> anastasiac: i'm making some changes based on review cindy just did
2015-11-16T21:24:50 <alanharnum> should hopefully be merged shortly
2015-11-16T21:24:57 <anastasiac> k
2015-11-16T21:44:42 <anastasiac> jhung: I pushed changes to FLOE-438
2015-11-16T21:44:58 <jhung> ok anastasiac taking a look now
2015-11-16T21:50:00 * colinclark has quit
2015-11-16T21:50:35 <jhung> anastasiac: merged
2015-11-16T21:50:42 <anastasiac> yay! thanks, jhung
2015-11-16T21:50:56 <anastasiac> the ILDH changes are merged, just waiting on production deployment
2015-11-16T21:51:51 <cindyli> alanharnum, anastasiac, alanharnum's pull request for the chart authoring has been merged
2015-11-16T21:52:07 <anastasiac> yay!
2015-11-16T21:52:14 <alanharnum> cindyli: thank you very much for the merge & for all your fantastic comments :)
2015-11-16T21:52:27 <anastasiac> so slick...
2015-11-16T21:52:28 <alanharnum> my code is always like 200% better after cindyli has looked at it
2015-11-16T21:53:21 <anastasiac> cindyli is fabulous, indeed
2015-11-16T21:53:44 <jhung> How do we deploy floeproject.org anastasiac?
2015-11-16T21:53:59 <jhung> It's been a while for me.
2015-11-16T21:54:00 <alanharnum> it should get deployed automagically - i'm looking at the Jenkins config right now
2015-11-16T21:54:01 <anastasiac> just a simple gh-pages branch, jhung
2015-11-16T21:54:25 <anastasiac> alanharnum: should the publication to the gh-pages branch happen automatically? because some changes were merged last week that aren\xe2\x80\x99t yet public
2015-11-16T21:54:30 <jhung> oh yeah anastasiac. I'll do that now.
2015-11-16T21:54:42 <anastasiac> wait, jhung, let\xe2\x80\x99s hear from alanharnum
2015-11-16T21:54:54 <jhung> I just realized that. :)
2015-11-16T21:56:36 <cindyli> alanharnum, anastasiac, thanks for the compliment. good luck with tomorrow's trip, and enjoy the storm :)
2015-11-16T21:56:47 <anastasiac> jhung: http://handbook.floeproject.org/WebGamesAndSimulations.html :-)
2015-11-16T21:57:02 <jhung> Awesome anastasiac!

2015-11-16T22:06:22 <alanharnum> jhung: anastasiac & I talked - looks like merging master to gh-pages should deploy it
2015-11-16T22:09:37 <jhung> alanharnum: ok. I'll do that now.
2015-11-16T22:09:43 <anastasiac> jhung: done already
2015-11-16T22:09:46 <anastasiac> beat ya!

2015-11-16T22:10:41 <anastasiac> we\xe2\x80\x99re looking good to go!
2015-11-16T22:11:29 <jhung> yep awesome stuff anastasiac. :)
2015-11-16T22:12:19 <anastasiac> jhung: should the accessible forces/motions sim work in ff?
2015-11-16T22:13:23 <anastasiac> ah, shoot, bad URL in the news article, jhung\xe2\x80\xa6
2015-11-16T22:13:34 <anastasiac> I\xe2\x80\x99ll fix that and ask you to test and push
2015-11-16T22:13:44 <jhung> Should be this one anastasiac: http://www.colorado.edu/physics/phet/dev/html/forces-and-motion-basics/1.1.5-accessible-instance.3/forces-and-motion-basics_en.html?accessibility&screens=1

2015-11-16T22:14:46 <jhung> Sorry. I should have caught that anastasiac
2015-11-16T22:15:40 <anastasiac> jhung: I think this is small enough that I can just push the fix, jhung
2015-11-16T22:16:09 <jhung> ok anastasiac
2015-11-16T22:19:35 <anastasiac> done

2015-11-16T20:30:59 <cindyli> anastasiac: as per ur comment of "I guess since the credentials api refers to \'secret\' this way, we can too.", does it mean to add the same explanations to the first discovery doc too?
2015-11-16T20:31:53 <anastasiac> well, cindyli, that\xe2\x80\x99s not what I meant, but maybe it would be a good idea to add a short description based on the APIs description\xe2\x80\xa6 maybe in () after the word \xe2\x80\x98secret\xe2\x80\x99?
2015-11-16T20:32:06 <anastasiac> those are brackets
2015-11-16T20:32:38 <cindyli> ok. thanks, anastasiac
