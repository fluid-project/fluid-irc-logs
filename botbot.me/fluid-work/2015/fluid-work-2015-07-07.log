2015-07-07T19:23:07 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: is there something like fluid.accumulate that can work on objects?
2015-07-07T19:23:42 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - can you describe how it would work?
2015-07-07T19:24:48 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: i want to iterate over an object of objects... for example { "id1": {value: 4}, "id2": {value: 6}}
2015-07-07T19:24:57 <Justin_o> and i\'d like to sum up the total of the values
2015-07-07T19:25:28 <Justin_o> what i\'m thinking of doing right now is to use fluid.keys on the parent object
2015-07-07T19:25:40 <Justin_o> and doing a fluid.accumulate on the keys
2015-07-07T19:27:19 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - that\'s reasonable, yes
2015-07-07T19:27:24 <Bosmon7> How did this situation arise?
2015-07-07T19:27:48 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: working on the chart authoring tool https://www.dropbox.com/s/mddmnfsqjy7t599/CA%20Tool%20%5Bsimplified%5D.pdf?dl=0
2015-07-07T19:28:09 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - cool
2015-07-07T19:28:27 <Bosmon7> How does it come to be that the keys don\'t have a natural ordering?
2015-07-07T19:28:31 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: I have a component for each line --- value % description
2015-07-07T19:28:41 <Justin_o> planing to use dynamic components to create those
2015-07-07T19:28:55 <Justin_o> for now there will only be 5 all the time though
2015-07-07T19:29:16 <Justin_o> anyways, the parent model will look like this
2015-07-07T19:29:22 <Justin_o> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/ERoMoAss/
2015-07-07T19:30:00 <Justin_o> where uuid is some identifier for the component.. not sure what to use yet maybe really a unique id
2015-07-07T19:30:13 <Justin_o> or the component name if that is different for each
2015-07-07T19:30:30 <Justin_o> this would be a shared model with the dynamicComponent
2015-07-07T19:30:43 <Justin_o> and i\'d want to loop over those dataEntries to calculate the totals
2015-07-07T19:31:04 <Justin_o> although percentage will always either be 100 or null
2015-07-07T19:31:13 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: ^
2015-07-07T19:31:40 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - ok
2015-07-07T19:31:51 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: does that make sense?
2015-07-07T19:32:06 <Bosmon7> It seems like the rendition of the data used in both the visual and sonified version of the chart will be sorted in order of percentage
2015-07-07T19:33:12 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: i believe so, although it could be alphabetical i guess
2015-07-07T19:33:37 <Justin_o> murilocrivellari: is the chart always sorted by percentage?
2015-07-07T19:34:03 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - Oh yes, I was meaning to ask you about the docs question from yesterday
2015-07-07T19:34:26 <Bosmon7> You said that you didn\'t know where we were in our workflow for having docs for all of our components - who might know that?
2015-07-07T19:34:51 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: um, maybe simonjb or anastasiac (on vacation)
2015-07-07T19:35:13 <Bosmon7> ok cool
2015-07-07T19:35:13 <Justin_o> i\'m not sure we actually decided anything, but in truth i don\'t really remember
2015-07-07T19:35:50 <murilocrivellari> Justin_o: this appears to be the most common practice for pie charts, but it could be alphabetical as well
2015-07-07T19:36:32 <murilocrivellari> sepideh: what do you think about it? ^
2015-07-07T19:37:29 <simonjb> Bosmon7, Justin_o: I don\'t believe that we have a concrete plan for the docs for the remaining components
2015-07-07T19:37:34 <Justin_o> murilocrivellari: i\'m fine with that, i was just wondering because it appears that the wireframes happen to be alphabetical and sorted by percentage.. it\'s probably just a coincidence, so i wasn\'t sure what the intention was.
2015-07-07T19:38:16 <sepideh> Justin_o: could you please let me know what we are trying to decide about the pie chart?
2015-07-07T19:39:11 <Justin_o> sepideh: Bosmon7 made the comment "It seems like the rendition of the data used in both the visual and sonified version of the chart will be sorted in order of percentage"
2015-07-07T19:39:22 <Justin_o> i just wanted to verify if that was correct
2015-07-07T19:41:51 <murilocrivellari> Justin_o: that was in fact a coincidence, but I guess we are fine to have it sorted by percentage
2015-07-07T19:42:30 <Justin_o> murilocrivellari: thanks
2015-07-07T19:47:09 <sepideh> Justin_o: as murilocrivellari mentioned I think the percentages are more common than alphabetic orders. So, I guess it\xe2\x80\x99s better to use precentages in decending order
2015-07-07T19:52:32 <jhung> cindyli: I have finally pushed up my refactoring and mobile layout for the new doc-base project. Do you have time tomorrow so I can walk you through the Javascript component that needs to be written?
2015-07-07T19:53:29 <cindyli> sure, jhung
2015-07-07T19:55:43 <Bosmon7> Cool - cindyli, jhung - would you be able to write a short summary of your meeting up to the list?
2015-07-07T19:55:48 <Bosmon7> It sounds like it will be very interesting
2015-07-07T19:56:49 <cindyli> not a problem, Bosmon7, do you want to join the meeting too?
2015-07-07T19:56:57 <jhung> Bosmon: Sure. It\'s still very much work in progress at the moment.
2015-07-07T19:58:12 <Bosmon7> cindyli - I think I will be travelling
2015-07-07T19:58:21 <jhung> cindyli: not sure how interesting it will be. The javascript part is just adding / removing a class from the body element. Not too exciting. :) Bosmon7 feel free to join in that discussion if you want. Just wanted to set the proper expectations before the hype train runs away. :D
2015-07-07T19:58:23 <Bosmon7> Extremely rough notes will be perfectly fine :)
2015-07-07T19:58:36 <Bosmon7> jhung - cool - what will the class do?
2015-07-07T19:59:59 <jhung> I have set up a series of styles that when applied expands/contracts the Articles list in the sidebar. The same style also hides the article content area when on mobile so all that\'s visible is the article list, Bosmon7.
2015-07-07T20:00:15 <Bosmon7> There\'s one thing I\'d be interested in as some JavaScript work at some time, which would be the equivalent of what github already offers in its rendering of markdown - which is that when you hover over an anchor, you are presented with a tiny UI that allows you to select the URL to that anchor
2015-07-07T20:00:26 <Bosmon7> Right now it is very tedious writing anchor-based links between pages in our docs
2015-07-07T20:00:39 <jhung> The class acts like a boolean for CSS.
2015-07-07T20:00:52 <Bosmon7> Since as far as I can see you just have to view the source in the developer tools to see what the anchor URL is
2015-07-07T20:02:23 <Bosmon7> For example, discovering links of the kind http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/Invokers.html#compact-format
2015-07-07T20:03:09 <Bosmon7> Ironically discovering this link from the original raw markdown file is much easier - https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/blob/master/src/documents/Invokers.md
2015-07-07T20:03:16 <Bosmon7> Since github natively provides a UI for it
2015-07-07T20:04:30 <cindyli> umm.. i don\'t see the UI provided by github
2015-07-07T20:04:53 <cindyli> do i need to use a specific browser, Bosmon7
2015-07-07T20:05:12 <Bosmon7> cindyli - it works in all browsers that I know :)
2015-07-07T20:05:17 <Bosmon7> Try hovering over the anchor text
2015-07-07T20:05:24 <Bosmon7> And then you will see a little link icon appear to the left
2015-07-07T20:05:41 <Bosmon7> Perhaps you had not not noticed this incredibly helpful UI :)
2015-07-07T20:06:34 <cindyli> i certainly had not and still cannot make the icon appear. do you see it, jhung?
2015-07-07T20:06:42 <Bosmon7> !!!
2015-07-07T20:06:52 <cindyli> ha ha
2015-07-07T20:07:27 <cindyli> oh, i see, when i hover over an title anchor
2015-07-07T20:07:31 <Bosmon7> yes
2015-07-07T20:07:37 <cindyli> i thought on links
2015-07-07T20:07:43 <cindyli> cool. yes, got that
2015-07-07T20:08:37 <colinclark> That mantis shrimp is so creepy
2015-07-07T20:08:38 <jhung> Ah, yes that is convenient.
2015-07-07T20:09:00 <colinclark> it\'s hard to imagine having it be our chart authoring tool mascot
2015-07-07T20:09:49 <Bosmon7> Where do you see the shrimpie, colinclark?
2015-07-07T20:10:08 <cindyli> shrimp pie
2015-07-07T20:10:43 <cindyli> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantis_shrimp#Eyes
2015-07-07T20:11:52 <colinclark> Bosmon7: and http://theoatmeal.com/comics/mantis_shrimp
2015-07-07T20:13:00 <Bosmon7> It is apparently a CREATIVELY VIOLENT animal
2015-07-07T20:13:07 <Bosmon7> Very similar, perhaps, to a ..... CATTE
2015-07-07T20:13:15 <colinclark> yes

2015-07-07T12:32:12 <the-t-in-rtf> Hey, I\'m worried that there is a typo here that is misleading me:  https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/blob/e4f2a064d2a166c2d055360b70ba9bba8e0db813/src/documents/EventInjectionAndBoiling.md
2015-07-07T12:32:15 <the-t-in-rtf> Check out the last example.
2015-07-07T12:32:22 <the-t-in-rtf> listeners: {
2015-07-07T12:32:22 <the-t-in-rtf> "{injectedListenerParent}.events.parentEvent", "examples.externalListener"
2015-07-07T12:32:22 <the-t-in-rtf> }
2015-07-07T12:32:29 <the-t-in-rtf> That isn\'t even valid JSON.
2015-07-07T12:32:38 <the-t-in-rtf> I\'m assuming the comma is supposed to be a colon?
2015-07-07T12:35:00 <the-t-in-rtf> I am getting the pull request ready, just want another set of eyes.
2015-07-07T12:35:08 <the-t-in-rtf> @bosmon
2015-07-07T12:35:55 <Justin_o> that looks like typo to me too
2015-07-07T12:36:54 <the-t-in-rtf> Yeah, when I saw the comma I thought for a moment you could pass in an array of listeners, and then I realized the second item didn\'t fit that.
2015-07-07T12:37:20 <the-t-in-rtf> Who reviews pull requests for the docs?  Should I assign it up front, or do a bunch of people look for new ones?

2015-07-07T12:42:55 <Justin_o> if you\'d like someone in particular to review it, you could assign it too
2015-07-07T12:45:51 <the-t-in-rtf> Actually, I can\'t assign it.
2015-07-07T12:45:56 <the-t-in-rtf> I think I lack permissions.

2015-07-07T13:33:47 <Bosmon7> Thanks the-t-in-rtf
2015-07-07T13:33:51 <Bosmon7> Will merge later
2015-07-07T13:34:04 <Bosmon7> IF ANYONE CALLS, SAY I\'M DESIGNING ST. PAUL\'S
2015-07-07T13:44:36 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: is that a quote from somewhere?
2015-07-07T13:47:21 <the-t-in-rtf> Sir Christopher Wren, apparently
2015-07-07T13:47:30 <the-t-in-rtf> I just reflexively google his utterances.
2015-07-07T13:47:51 <the-t-in-rtf> See the sidebar here:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul\'s_Cathedral

2015-07-07T13:52:55 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: i started reading this page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Wren "He was accorded responsibility for rebuilding 52 churches in the City of London after the Great Fire in 1666" and it strikes me as an odd coincidence that 52 churches would have burnt down in "1666"
2015-07-07T13:53:41 <alanharnum> a chance to use my English degree appears! it\xe2\x80\x99s super effective!
2015-07-07T13:54:35 <alanharnum> if you haven\xe2\x80\x99t read \xe2\x80\x98em https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawksmoor_(novel) or http://www.amazon.ca/Heat-Suicide-Bridge-Iain-Sinclair/dp/1862075042 are both fascinatingly creepy books about Wren and his masonic/occult church architecture.

2015-07-07T14:00:43 <Justin_o> alanharnum: i\'m not sure if i\'m more surprised that such books exist, or that you\'d happen to know about them and that they\'d fit so well into the conversation...

2015-07-07T14:01:37 <alanharnum> english majors are always seeking a chance to demonstrate the currency and relevance of our degree ;)

2015-07-07T14:40:36 <the-t-in-rtf1> history majors too.
2015-07-07T14:40:50 <the-t-in-rtf1> those who can remember history are doomed to work it into the conversation.
2015-07-07T14:41:05 <the-t-in-rtf1> Anyway, I\'m not either, and I love both\xe2\x80\xa6 :P
2015-07-07T14:41:15 <alanharnum> hehe

2015-07-07T14:42:04 <the-t-in-rtf1> It\'s good that there are people who remember this stuff without Wikipedia.
2015-07-07T14:42:42 <the-t-in-rtf1> I have a ridiculous memory for films, which was remarkable before there was such a thing as IMDB, but is less so now.
2015-07-07T14:44:02 <the-t-in-rtf1> Oh, wow, I was just seeing if there was a documentary on Wren and found this:  http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4575086/
2015-07-07T14:45:31 <the-t-in-rtf1> Life before the internet was less distracting but led to a lot less synchronicity in daily life.
