2015-06-17T13:35:52 <the-t-in-rtf> @all, to repeat my question from earlier, is it normal for a model listener to be sent a change that\'s just a plain string?  I see strings in some cases and objects with multiple keyed paths in others.
2015-06-17T13:36:32 <the-t-in-rtf> ping @Bosmon
2015-06-17T13:39:12 <Bosmon7> Hi the-t-in-rtf
2015-06-17T13:39:29 <Bosmon7> I\'m imagining "to be sent a change", you\'re referring to the path of the change?

2015-06-17T14:02:43 <Justin_o> Bosmon: I updated the FLUID-5542 pull request. I hope I fixed up the tests as per your suggestions
2015-06-17T14:04:19 * colinclark joined the channel
2015-06-17T14:09:17 <the-t-in-rtf> @bosmon, take a look at the binder we\'ve been working on:  https://github.com/the-t-in-rtf/gpii-handlebars/blob/GPII-1175/src/js/client/binder.js#L84
2015-06-17T14:10:14 <the-t-in-rtf> That structure has worked fine up to now, i.e. we always end up with a change that includes path information.  In my testing with new components, somehow the same function ends up with a raw string.
2015-06-17T14:10:31 <the-t-in-rtf> With no changes to the model applier or the base grade for the old and new components.
2015-06-17T14:10:34 <Justin_o> cindyli: are you able to wrap up this pull request https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/587
2015-06-17T14:10:55 <cindyli> yes, Justin_o
2015-06-17T14:10:59 <cindyli> will do it soon
2015-06-17T14:11:11 <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks
2015-06-17T14:11:19 <cindyli> np
2015-06-17T14:24:02 <Bosmon7> the-t-in-rtf - what characterises a "new component" rather than an "old component"?
2015-06-17T14:24:31 <Justin_o> cindyli: do you have time to take a look at a pull request, https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/610
2015-06-17T14:24:35 <Justin_o> it should be really quick.
2015-06-17T14:24:56 <the-t-in-rtf> They are both usages of the new \'templateAware\' grade.
2015-06-17T14:25:01 <cindyli> sure, Justin_o
2015-06-17T14:25:09 <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks
2015-06-17T14:25:15 <cindyli> np
2015-06-17T14:25:22 <the-t-in-rtf> The ones that have the "pathed" change structure include bindings that are exercised on startup.
2015-06-17T14:25:38 <the-t-in-rtf> The change object always seems to include those initial changes.
2015-06-17T14:26:17 <Bosmon7> the-t-in-rtf - all I can think of is that you have somehow managed to get an "old" model component into your grade structure
2015-06-17T14:26:28 <Bosmon7> The old contract for model listeners was that they received (newModel, oldModel)
2015-06-17T14:26:37 <Bosmon7> The new contract is that they receive (newValue, oldValue)
2015-06-17T14:26:56 <Bosmon7> That is, where I say "newValue" I mean the subpart of the model for which they subscribed to changes
2015-06-17T14:27:20 <Bosmon7> So, a "fluid.modelComponent" would receive the former - a "fluid.modelRelayComponent" would receive the latter
2015-06-17T14:27:56 <the-t-in-rtf> These are extending fluid.viewRelayComponent
2015-06-17T14:28:06 <Bosmon7> Is this what you are meaning when you refer to a "pathed" change structure?
2015-06-17T14:28:22 <the-t-in-rtf> I am always getting the new value correctly.
2015-06-17T14:28:25 <Bosmon7> aha
2015-06-17T14:28:35 <the-t-in-rtf> I think I may somehow have managed to listen to too broad a range of similar changes
2015-06-17T14:29:10 <the-t-in-rtf> but so I understand, if the "subpart of the model" is a single value, then that literal value is passed?
2015-06-17T14:29:42 <Bosmon7> Well this line suggests to me that you don\'t think you are receiving just the new value: https://github.com/the-t-in-rtf/gpii-handlebars/blob/GPII-1175/src/js/client/binder.js#L84
2015-06-17T14:29:52 <Bosmon7> Since otherwise you would just write "change" rather than "change[path]"
2015-06-17T14:30:30 <the-t-in-rtf> Yes, that\'s the problem.  Every example in the tests there receives an object with { otherPath: \xe2\x80\xa6, otherPath2: \xe2\x80\xa6, path: "what I want" }
2015-06-17T14:30:48 <the-t-in-rtf> if I change it to use plain old change, all of those will fail.
2015-06-17T14:31:02 <Bosmon7> Ah wait worry, I\'m misreading this code
2015-06-17T14:31:29 * cindyli has quit
2015-06-17T14:32:39 <the-t-in-rtf> I have a workaround that uses change.path ? change.path : change, but want to understand why I am getting two different forms of change.
2015-06-17T14:33:19 <the-t-in-rtf> The docs don\'t mention anything about paths.
2015-06-17T14:33:33 <the-t-in-rtf> at least not that I\'ve found.
2015-06-17T14:33:50 <Bosmon7> Yes, sorry - the problem you are seeing is a bug in the old implementation
2015-06-17T14:34:02 <Bosmon7> This is fixed, together with doc fixes, in the large branch that colinclark is reviewing
2015-06-17T14:34:24 <Bosmon7> In the meantime you should continue to use your fix, and add a comment that it needs to be removed when you can upgrade to the new framework
2015-06-17T14:36:03 <Bosmon7> The old (i.e. current) framework was inconsistent in the literal argument sent to change listeners, but this wasn\'t observed because all the code in the wild uses the declarative IoC form of listeners which bind to {change} which is unambiguous
2015-06-17T14:37:41 <the-t-in-rtf> Link for the JIRA ticket?
2015-06-17T14:38:09 <the-t-in-rtf> Also for the pull request?
2015-06-17T14:38:12 <the-t-in-rtf> I want to watch it.
2015-06-17T14:39:03 <Bosmon7> Pull request is https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/591

2015-06-17T14:52:23 <Justin_o> Bosmon7, Bosmon: we should probably finish off our discussion about the tag name this week... did you want to kick off a thread on fluid-work about it?
2015-06-17T14:52:38 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - sure
2015-06-17T14:53:04 <Justin_o> thanks
2015-06-17T14:53:27 <the-t-in-rtf> Thanks, @bosmon, I will add that to the pull request for gpii.handlebars shortly.
