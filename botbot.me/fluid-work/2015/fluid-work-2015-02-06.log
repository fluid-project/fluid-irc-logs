b'2015-02-06T15:32:38 <Justin_o> cindyli: where can i get the content of the tooltip from
2015-02-06T15:32:47 <Justin_o> i tried using model.content but keep getting undefined
2015-02-06T15:33:12 <cindyli> Justin_o: vidyo?
2015-02-06T15:33:19 <Justin_o> sure

2015-02-06T15:51:23 <clown> hey jhernandez, sorry for the head ache.
2015-02-06T15:51:33 <clown> I\'ll check as you asked.

2015-02-06T16:52:02 <michelled> simonjb: do you have opinions on this? https://nodesecurity.io/
2015-02-06T16:52:49 <anastasiac> cindyli, I think I may have found a bug in the first discovery tool: On the contrast screen, I can click on black-on-white and white-on-black and the arrow moves, but clicking on no-change doesn\xe2\x80\x99t select it. Is that a known issue?
2015-02-06T16:53:57 <cindyli> no, anastasiac, we actually haven\'t touched the contrast screen yet, it\'s just a plain html template.
2015-02-06T16:54:07 <simonjb> michelled: I\'ve not seen it before
2015-02-06T16:54:12 <anastasiac> ok, cindyli
2015-02-06T17:02:13 <anastasiac> jhung, if you could have a look at my pull request before you sign off for the day, that would be really helpful: https://github.com/fluid-project/first-discovery/pull/9
2015-02-06T17:09:17 <simonjb> michelled: "Security bugs in third party modules should be reported to their respective maintainers and can also be coordinated through the Node Security Project." [http://nodejs.org/about/security/]
2015-02-06T17:09:53 <michelled> interesting
2015-02-06T17:10:04 <michelled> so, early days, but looking like it\'s picking up some steam?
2015-02-06T17:10:23 <simonjb> michelled: yes, that seems like a reasonable assessment
2015-02-06T17:11:17 <jhung> anastasiac: sure.
2015-02-06T17:48:00 <anastasiac> Justin_o, you hooked up the text size enactor, right?
2015-02-06T17:48:09 <anastasiac> I\xe2\x80\x99m testing on the tablets
2015-02-06T17:48:42 <anastasiac> I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll need to adjust the default state of the text size model to be 80% - that\xe2\x80\x99s what it is, effectively, on the tablets
2015-02-06T17:49:02 <anastasiac> you can\xe2\x80\x99t make it much bigger, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the way we want it to start out - near max size
2015-02-06T17:54:46 <Justin_o> anastasiac: actually cindyli made that change.. i did the code review
2015-02-06T17:55:54 <cindyli> anastasiac: is that only for tablets? does it mean we need to have a device detector?
2015-02-06T17:56:15 <anastasiac> no, cindyli, it would be for every implementation
2015-02-06T17:56:58 <anastasiac> Also, cindyli, I found a tooltip bug in Safari on the tablet, and I filed it: http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLOE-263 We\xe2\x80\x99ll have to decide how to prioritize touch interfaces right now...
2015-02-06T17:57:28 <cindyli> ok, anastasiac. in terms of 80%, i don\'t think i understand. do you mean we need to set the initial text size smaller
2015-02-06T17:57:37 * jhernandez has quit
2015-02-06T17:58:10 <anastasiac> cindyli, the css should stay the same, and everything should be the same, but the font size that we\xe2\x80\x99re currently using should be considered to be 80% of the max. Does that make sense?
2015-02-06T17:58:23 <cindyli> ok, i se
2015-02-06T17:58:25 <cindyli> i see
2015-02-06T17:59:50 <cindyli> anastasiac: based on this 80%, the max and min for the text size can be determined too
2015-02-06T18:00:10 <anastasiac> ok
2015-02-06T18:00:15 <cindyli> shall we run thru this with dana, anastasiac
2015-02-06T18:01:13 <anastasiac> I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we really need to, cindyli. We already know that we want the tool to be starting out with a very large setting, near the max
2015-02-06T18:01:41 <cindyli> ok, anastasiac, will make that change
2015-02-06T18:01:46 <anastasiac> thanks
2015-02-06T18:02:12 <cindyli> np
2015-02-06T18:05:56 <Justin_o> cindyli: could you please look at my pull request https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/585
2015-02-06T18:06:05 <cindyli> sure, Justin_o
2015-02-06T18:43:10 * slim_jim_ joined the channel
2015-02-06T18:43:11 <jhung> anastasiac: are those tooltips when hovering over the back and next buttons? How are those supposed to look?
2015-02-06T18:43:54 <anastasiac> jhung, those are tooltips, and we don\xe2\x80\x99t yet have any design guidance for them. Dana will hopefully work on that next week, so you can leave them out of your review for now :-)
2015-02-06T18:44:19 <jhung> ok thanks
2015-02-06T18:45:23 * slim_jim has quit
2015-02-06T18:45:35 * slim_jim_ is now known as slim_jim
2015-02-06T18:46:12 <jhung> anastasiac: I was thinking that it would be awesome if the button being activated stayed centered to the mouse pointer as font size increases.
2015-02-06T18:46:21 <jhung> ^a nice-to-have
2015-02-06T18:46:57 <anastasiac> yes, jhung, I think Dana has some specific suggestions for how she\xe2\x80\x99d like things to change as the size changes, and keeping the +/- buttons centre-screen was one of them. Not yet implemented...
2015-02-06T18:53:45 <Justin_o> cindyli: i\'ve updated the name of the enactors
2015-02-06T18:54:00 <cindyli> thanks, Justin_o
2015-02-06T19:03:58 <Justin_o> jhung: here\'s the contrast issue i filed the other day, sorry forgot to send it to you earlier. http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLOE-259
2015-02-06T19:05:01 <jhung> np Justin_o I guess it\'s not urgent until FF has working web speech.
2015-02-06T19:05:42 <Justin_o> jhung: yep
2015-02-06T19:07:44 <jhung> anastasiac: is it intenional that "no change" colour option can\'t be selected?
2015-02-06T19:08:28 <anastasiac> jhung, no, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why that\xe2\x80\x99s happening. I mentioned it to cindyli. That page is just a dummy page for now, so it\xe2\x80\x99s not top priority, but I will probably file it so we don\xe2\x80\x99t forget about it
2015-02-06T19:09:09 <jhung> ok anastasiac.
2015-02-06T19:20:01 * Sepideh has quit
2015-02-06T19:24:08 <jhung> Justin_o: is the first discovery supposed to work on iOS?
2015-02-06T19:27:15 <Justin_o> jhung: I believe so
2015-02-06T19:27:53 <jhung> Justin_o: ok. It doesn\'t seem like it\'s working on iOS simulator in Xcode anyway. I don\'t have a iPhone anymore to test with.
2015-02-06T19:28:17 <Justin_o> Okay. What\'s wrong?
2015-02-06T19:28:34 <jhung> The panel is not showing up. "header" and "footer" show though.
2015-02-06T19:29:00 <jhung> at any rate, the pull request looks good to merge. These other issues are unrelated.
2015-02-06T19:30:02 <anastasiac> jhung, Justin_o: I tested teh tool on the iPad
2015-02-06T19:30:12 <anastasiac> it seems ok, except for a wee bit of styling issues
2015-02-06T19:30:20 * Sepideh joined the channel
2015-02-06T19:30:46 <anastasiac> our main mobile goal is tablet
2015-02-06T19:32:03 <jhung> ok. I\'ll test on my Android Nexus anastasiac.
2015-02-06T19:32:31 <anastasiac> jhung, I also tested on our Samsung tablet in Chrome. seemed ok, but nexus is also a good test
2015-02-06T19:33:42 <jhung> ok anastasiac
2015-02-06T19:35:00 <Justin_o> anastasiac: it would be good to find out what version of android that tablet is running
2015-02-06T19:35:18 <anastasiac> Justin_o, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go check
2015-02-06T19:35:29 <Justin_o> thanks
2015-02-06T19:37:57 <anastasiac> Justin_o: 4.2.2
2015-02-06T19:40:33 * avtar joined the channel
2015-02-06T19:46:55 <jhung> Justin_o: works okay on Nexus 7 w Android 5 in Chrome. The adjuster isn\'t centered but it works.
2015-02-06T19:48:10 <Justin_o> jhung, anastasiac: thanks
2015-02-06T19:48:24 <Justin_o> anastasiac: seems that 4.2.2 is maybe 2 versions back http://www.android.com/history/
2015-02-06T19:48:30 <Justin_o> do you know if there is an update for it?
2015-02-06T19:48:56 <anastasiac> Justin_o, probably. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if Bert set it up to update automatically or not. I\xe2\x80\x99ll have a look a bit later
2015-02-06T19:49:21 <Justin_o> anastasiac: thanks.. do you know if there is a specific version of android that we want to target?
2015-02-06T19:50:14 <anastasiac> don\xe2\x80\x99t know, Justin_o. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we\xe2\x80\x99ve thought it through that much, but we might want to go with infusion model, which is \xe2\x80\x9clatest"
2015-02-06T19:50:27 <Justin_o> anastasiac: okay, thanks
2015-02-06T19:55:58 <jhung> anastasiac: the tool tips sometimes block the user from selecting back and next. This is especially the case if the text is larger
2015-02-06T19:56:38 <anastasiac> ah, good catch, jhung. We should make sure we address this when we implement the final tooltip styling: we should include good positioning
2015-02-06T19:57:16 <jhung> ok. I\'ve made comments anastasiac. Otherwise it looks good to merge.
2015-02-06T19:57:24 <anastasiac> thanks, jhung!
2015-02-06T19:59:10 <jhung> anastasiac: I think we can merge what we have now and file jiras for the issues or fix them with the appropriate existing tasks
2015-02-06T19:59:32 <anastasiac> yes, I think that would be good, jhung. The remaining issues are pretty minor
2015-02-06T20:01:07 <jhung> done anastasiac.
2015-02-06T20:01:19 <anastasiac> yay! thanks, jhung
2015-02-06T20:01:45 <jhung> Should I close that jira anastasiac?
2015-02-06T20:01:50 <anastasiac> cindyli, Justin_o: my FLOE-261 branch has been merged, fixing many styling issues.
2015-02-06T20:01:57 <anastasiac> sure, jhung, thanks
2015-02-06T20:02:19 <cindyli> awesome. thanks, anastasiac and jhung

2015-02-06T11:34:45 <kasparnet> hey slim_jim
2015-02-06T11:34:53 <kasparnet> https://docs.google.com/document/d/13fqxn2kpmLcdDkSnHKKpW3DtHaKVxP_zyA92-NqxWLU/edit <- that\'s the script we used
2015-02-06T11:35:43 <kasparnet> a more boiled down version can be found here: https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/328/files (ie. in the .md file here: https://github.com/kaspermarkus/universal/blob/GPII-966/testData/preferences/review3/review3-preferences.md)
2015-02-06T11:35:53 <slim_jim> awesome - I guess that covers everything we have?
2015-02-06T11:36:02 <kasparnet> well - no :S
2015-02-06T11:36:11 <kasparnet> for example, maavis isn\'t on the list
2015-02-06T11:36:24 <kasparnet> neither is eCTouch
2015-02-06T11:36:39 <slim_jim> tsk, shame on you! :)
2015-02-06T11:36:41 <kasparnet> and some others
2015-02-06T11:36:46 <kasparnet> hehe yeah, sorry :)
2015-02-06T11:37:01 <kasparnet> I guess your best bet might be going through the 3 solutions registries
2015-02-06T11:37:12 <kasparnet> ... all apps in those are integrated
2015-02-06T11:37:19 <slim_jim> hmm, perhaps I need a list of all those solutions then. Does one exists?
2015-02-06T11:37:24 <slim_jim> doing a quick blog post
2015-02-06T11:37:29 <kasparnet> cool
2015-02-06T11:37:49 <slim_jim> oh - doh! of course \'use the source luke"
2015-02-06T11:38:08 <kasparnet> hehe
2015-02-06T11:38:35 <kasparnet> but let me know if anything in there isn\'t clear.. I might be able to be helpful
2015-02-06T11:38:36 <slim_jim> when you say 3 solutions registries I though we currently used the one master file?
2015-02-06T11:39:09 <kasparnet> we\'re using one master for the device reporter -- but the solutions registry is split across 3 files (win32, android and linux)
2015-02-06T11:39:48 <slim_jim> yesy, I\'m getting mixed up with the device reporter installedSOlutions.json
2015-02-06T11:40:19 <slim_jim> Thanks. It\'s useful to see you script though. Even if you did miss out all the really coos stuff :-/
2015-02-06T11:40:29 <slim_jim> *cool
2015-02-06T11:41:24 <slim_jim> kasparnet: how about web? We are close with oAuth right?
2015-02-06T11:41:45 <kasparnet> oh yeah - web should be good as well
2015-02-06T11:42:03 <kasparnet> yeah - oath is working, but still requires a few tests/cleanup
2015-02-06T11:42:15 <kasparnet> expecting it to go in by next week
2015-02-06T11:42:16 <slim_jim> Darwin - well that\'s apple so no chance :)

2015-02-06T13:10:28 <kasparnet> .. so I\'m not sure whether to add tests for this as in browser LFM tests, or whether I should do full integration tests to ensure that the full stack is reacting properly to the change
2015-02-06T13:12:01 <kasparnet> Bosmon7: ^

2015-02-06T13:23:47 <kasparnet> Second question is: with regards to this https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/315 .. we decided to have a flag for rechecking or not... Would I just add a check around here: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/lifecycleManager/src/LifecycleManager.js#L203 and call gpii.toPromise(fluid.invokeGlobalFunction(resolvedName + ".set", [payload]) directly if the flag tells us not to check setting
2015-02-06T13:23:47 <kasparnet> s after setting them
2015-02-06T13:23:51 <kasparnet> ?
2015-02-06T13:50:18 <Bosmon7> kasparnet - yes
2015-02-06T13:50:28 <Bosmon7> Although really you\'ll just reimplement invokeRetryingHandler
2015-02-06T13:50:33 <Bosmon7> And instead call it invokeSettingsHandler which accepts the flag
2015-02-06T13:50:43 <Bosmon7> Because of course you don\'t like duplicating code, do yoU!
2015-02-06T13:50:49 <kasparnet> yup, that makes sense
2015-02-06T13:50:53 <kasparnet> haha, no sir!

2015-02-06T14:08:08 <Justin_o> cindyli: did you talk to dana and anastasiac about what the default value for the text size should be?
2015-02-06T14:08:50 <cindyli> i talked to dana yesterday, Justin_o, she said 42px, which is the 2.5rem that the tool is currently using
2015-02-06T14:10:35 <cindyli> well, actually 42px should be 2.625rem, but she is fine with what\'s there now, 2.5rem
2015-02-06T14:11:21 <kasparnet> Bosmon7: there is an extra argument here https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/lifecycleManager/src/LifecycleManager.js#L203
2015-02-06T14:11:36 <kasparnet> that I dont see the actual function take into account
2015-02-06T14:12:49 <kasparnet> Bosmon7:
2015-02-06T14:13:03 <kasparnet> ok,nevermind -- I\'m getting confused by multiple things having the same name
2015-02-06T14:13:19 <Justin_o> cindyli: but that shouldn\'t be the minimum should it.. that\'s somewhere in the middle right?
2015-02-06T14:13:50 <cindyli> ah ha, forgot to talk about the range\xe2\x80\xa6 sorry
2015-02-06T14:14:23 <Justin_o> cindyli: okay, so maybe we\'ll leave this pull open for now then and wait to hear about that.. does that make sense?
2015-02-06T14:15:16 <cindyli> the pull request for hooking up the enactor? why would it be related to the default text size, Justin_o?
2015-02-06T14:16:06 <Justin_o> cindyli: because the default is for the text size adjuster
2015-02-06T14:17:59 <kasparnet> Bosmon7: ok... still confused
2015-02-06T14:18:09 <cindyli> this pull request is to ensure the enactor responds as expected. i think the default values for the text size is not really relevant, Justin_o
2015-02-06T14:18:25 <kasparnet> this function is defined https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/settingsHandlers/src/settingsHandlerUtilities.js#L118
2015-02-06T14:18:49 <kasparnet> but I dont see any other usage of it, other than in the integration tests
2015-02-06T14:19:21 <Justin_o> cindyli: do we have another task or jira for that?
2015-02-06T14:19:47 <cindyli> Justin_o: i\'m working on another jira to add tooltips for text size panel
2015-02-06T14:20:07 <Justin_o> cindyli: i mean about setting the correct default value?
2015-02-06T14:20:13 <Justin_o> sorry, no question mark
2015-02-06T14:20:13 <cindyli> we can either use this one for that or create another one for default values
2015-02-06T14:20:24 <Justin_o> cindyli: okay
2015-02-06T14:20:34 <Justin_o> can you comment on the pull request about this
2015-02-06T14:20:38 <cindyli> sure
2015-02-06T14:21:40 <Bosmon7> kasparnet - ok yes sorry, there is already a thing of that name
2015-02-06T14:21:55 <kasparnet> Bosmon7: but could it be true that it\'s never used?
2015-02-06T14:22:00 <Bosmon7> No, it is not true
2015-02-06T14:22:13 <kasparnet> but WHERE?!?!?!
2015-02-06T14:22:32 <cindyli> Justin_o: commented
2015-02-06T14:22:40 <kasparnet> aaaarrgghghg.. my "find in files" skills have failed me yet again
2015-02-06T14:22:40 <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks
2015-02-06T14:22:43 <cindyli> np
2015-02-06T14:22:57 <Bosmon7> Yes
2015-02-06T14:23:10 <Bosmon7> Never use an editor that doesn\'t actually succeed at finding things in files : P
2015-02-06T14:24:22 <kasparnet> ok - I preobably should have extended my search to the platform specific repos
2015-02-06T14:24:24 <kasparnet> got it
2015-02-06T14:24:29 <kasparnet> ... ok thanks antranig
