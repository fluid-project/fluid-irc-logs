2015-01-17T00:37:49 <kasparnet> hey Bosmon7
2015-01-17T00:37:53 <Bosmon7> oh wow
2015-01-17T00:37:55 <Bosmon7> You\'re still awake
2015-01-17T00:37:58 <Bosmon7> What are you trying to do?
2015-01-17T00:38:00 <kasparnet> half
2015-01-17T00:38:11 <kasparnet> through quite a bit of wine and beer
2015-01-17T00:38:34 <kasparnet> and while the code level is deteriorating, we\'re making decent progress
2015-01-17T00:38:58 <kasparnet> but we have some stuff that would be nice to talk through with you tomorrow
2015-01-17T00:39:16 <kasparnet> Bosmon7: in terms of the pull requests
2015-01-17T00:39:19 <kasparnet> ?*
2015-01-17T00:39:34 <Bosmon7> In terms of your need for a function for escaping dots
2015-01-17T00:39:48 <kasparnet> oh - that was for the webanywhere implementation
2015-01-17T00:39:57 <kasparnet> but I think I decided I didn\'t need it anyway
2015-01-17T00:40:16 <Bosmon7> You probably don\'t
2015-01-17T00:40:45 <kasparnet> nope

2015-01-17T17:21:48 <Bosmon7> Hi there simonjb - do you happen to be around?
2015-01-17T17:22:30 <simonjb> hey Bosmon7
2015-01-17T17:22:47 <Bosmon7> Hey there
2015-01-17T17:23:14 <Bosmon7> I notice you\'ve created a further instance of your universal branch, review3-GPII-17
2015-01-17T17:23:23 <Bosmon7> Do you have a preference which one I merge up with?
2015-01-17T17:23:30 <Bosmon7> What\'s the role of the 2 different branches?
2015-01-17T17:24:07 <simonjb> Bosmon7: the review3-GPII-17 is the one that is deployed and has a webhook to run the Docker build process
2015-01-17T17:24:29 <Bosmon7> A WEBHOOK!
2015-01-17T17:24:35 <simonjb> GPII-17 is the main branch and then I merge into review3-GPII-17 when ready to deploy
2015-01-17T17:25:35 <simonjb> Bosmon7: https://developer.github.com/webhooks/
2015-01-17T17:25:58 <Bosmon7> Oh I see
2015-01-17T17:26:07 <simonjb> Bosmon7: is used by the Docker build service
2015-01-17T17:26:30 <simonjb> the Docker build service runs a build when it sees a commit to review3-GPII-17
2015-01-17T17:28:32 <Bosmon7> ok
2015-01-17T17:28:45 <Bosmon7> It sounds like I should continue to integrate with the main GPII-17 branch you have?
2015-01-17T17:31:39 <simonjb> Bosmon7: yes, GPII-17
2015-01-17T17:31:49 <Bosmon7> Cool - thanks, simonjb
2015-01-17T17:32:16 <Bosmon7> This "webhook" seems terribly impressive : P

2015-01-17T19:33:05 <Bosmon7> Hi there simonjb
2015-01-17T19:34:36 <simonjb> hi Bosmon7
2015-01-17T19:34:51 <Bosmon7> I\'m in the middle of writing tests for our revocation workflow
2015-01-17T19:35:50 <Bosmon7> I noticed that, as far as I can see, the current auth server doesn\'t expose an "authDecisionId" via any endpoint other than our "baked markup" endpoint /authorized-services
2015-01-17T19:36:23 <simonjb> Bosmon7: yes, that\'s the case at the moment
2015-01-17T19:36:23 <Bosmon7> Firstly i) is this correct, and then ii) are you ok with me making a "companion endpoint" called, say, /authorized-services-payload that returns the JSON version of the payload under just the same circumstances?
2015-01-17T19:36:58 <Bosmon7> I\'ll comment it appropriately to indicate that it is i) used only in test cases, and ii) will eventually replace the markup endpoint once we refactor in the future
2015-01-17T19:37:18 <simonjb> i) yes and ii) yes, I think we\'ll want to move an an ajax version of that page
2015-01-17T19:37:23 <Bosmon7> cool, great
2015-01-17T19:37:36 <simonjb> sounds good
2015-01-17T19:38:09 <simonjb> thanks
2015-01-17T19:38:29 <Bosmon7> cheers, simonjb
2015-01-17T19:40:16 <simonjb> Bosmon7: would you mind doing this work in a branch other that GPII-17 so we have the option of not merging it before the review?
2015-01-17T19:41:13 <Bosmon7> simonjb - sure
2015-01-17T19:41:20 <simonjb> thanks Bosmon7
2015-01-17T19:41:25 <Bosmon7> I mean, it will be done in my version of the branch in any case
2015-01-17T19:41:35 <Bosmon7> It would have always required a positive decision from you to merge it...
2015-01-17T19:44:04 <simonjb> Bosmon7: ok, yes, that\'s reasonable; I\'m fine if you do it on your GPII-17
2015-01-17T19:44:19 <Bosmon7> cheers, simonjb
