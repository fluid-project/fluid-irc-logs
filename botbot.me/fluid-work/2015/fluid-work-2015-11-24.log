2015-11-24T15:14:23 <simonjb> ok, great
2015-11-24T15:30:58 <alanharnum> avtar: simonjb & I are in my vidyo room
2015-11-24T15:36:46 <colinclark> alanharnum: Can you remind me where your latest branch of the chart authoring tool is?
2015-11-24T15:37:03 <colinclark> The version that schedules both text to speech and changes to the sonification synth
2015-11-24T15:37:04 <alanharnum> colinclark: https://github.com/waharnum/chartAuthoring/tree/FLOE-437

2015-11-24T20:34:29 <anastasiac> colinclark, michelled: Regarding entering stuff into the dpsace listing: each entry mentions who submitted it. I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if I should create an organizational account for our entries, so that it says something like \xe2\x80\x9cOCAD University\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cFloe Project\xe2\x80\x9d, instead of \xe2\x80\x9canastasiac\xe2\x80\x9d. What do you think?
2015-11-24T20:34:47 * the-t-in-rtf has quit
2015-11-24T20:35:18 <colinclark> I think it makes sense
2015-11-24T20:35:26 <colinclark> perhaps Fluid Project is appropriate
2015-11-24T20:36:24 <anastasiac> hm. Do we have a general fluid contact email?
2015-11-24T20:38:55 <Justin_o> cindyli: what is the scope for when accessing the security server. https://wiki.gpii.net/w/GPII_OAuth_2_Guide#Work_Flow_2
2015-11-24T20:39:52 <cindyli> Justin_o: as to the doc, the scope must be set to "add_preferences"
2015-11-24T20:40:03 <cindyli> i probably didn\'t understand ur question correctly?
2015-11-24T20:40:05 <jhung> michelled: are the notes from the Floe brainstorming a few weeks ago on the wiki somewhere?
2015-11-24T20:40:26 <cindyli> Justin_o: i see, you ask why we need "scope"
2015-11-24T20:40:31 <Justin_o> cindyli: i\'m trying to document that generally, why is it needed
2015-11-24T20:40:35 <Justin_o> what does it do?
2015-11-24T20:40:48 <michelled> no, jhung - the intention is to put the things we are going to do onto the iteration page as we work on them
2015-11-24T20:41:11 <michelled> jhung: were you looking for something specific?
2015-11-24T20:41:41 <cindyli> Justin_o: this is for the future expansion, and scope is also an optional param specified in the OAuth spec. right now, the only scope we support is to add preferences, it could potentially be expanded for updating, deleting etc
2015-11-24T20:41:53 <Justin_o> cindyli: okay
2015-11-24T20:41:54 <Justin_o> thanks

2015-11-24T20:47:38 <jhung> michelled: I was looking to jog my memory. Also I thought it would have been a logical place to put the notes from this morning\'s debrief from OpenEd.
2015-11-24T20:49:53 <Justin_o> cindyli, anastasiac: any thoughts on this https://github.com/jobara/docs-first-discovery/blob/GPII-1337/src/documents/firstDiscoveryServer.md
2015-11-24T20:50:12 <michelled> jhung: the notes are here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tkq15fvLsVjyI3qVdHVNXw-2MCMKn5CJrkTqUZIBKiU/edit
2015-11-24T20:50:20 <Justin_o> cindyli: could you also make sure my descriptions are correct
2015-11-24T20:50:28 <cindyli> sure, Justin_o
2015-11-24T20:50:33 <Justin_o> thanks
2015-11-24T20:53:00 <cindyli> Justin_o: i wonder the requests for /demos and /src should be included as REST API
2015-11-24T20:53:29 <Justin_o> cindyli: you are thinking they should be removed because they just serve content?
2015-11-24T20:53:52 <cindyli> exactly, Justin_o
2015-11-24T20:54:41 <Justin_o> cindyli: okay sure
2015-11-24T20:54:42 <cindyli> they are more for internal use based on the structure of the first discovery tool code base, Justin_o
2015-11-24T20:56:04 <jhung> michelled: thanks. I\'ll put that somewhere on the wiki\xe2\x80\xa6 probably somewhere within the project coordination section
2015-11-24T20:56:15 <anastasiac> Justin_o: this looks pretty good. I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering about combining the two tables into one, somehow, since they\xe2\x80\x99re describing the same thing, sort of\xe2\x80\xa6 but you\xe2\x80\x99d want to make clear that they\xe2\x80\x99re describing alternatives...
2015-11-24T20:56:44 <Justin_o> anastasiac: i see your point, any thoughts on how to structure that?
2015-11-24T20:57:00 * anastasiac ponders
2015-11-24T20:57:04 <Justin_o> i could have a second column maybe, one for ENV and one for JSON
2015-11-24T20:58:01 <anastasiac> yeah, something like that
2015-11-24T21:00:00 <Justin_o> okay, i\'ll try to combine those
2015-11-24T21:06:10 <Justin_o> anastasiac, cindyli: I\'ve made the changes you recommended. https://github.com/jobara/docs-first-discovery/blob/GPII-1337/src/documents/firstDiscoveryServer.md
2015-11-24T21:06:17 <Justin_o> Any more thoughts?
2015-11-24T21:07:09 <anastasiac> oy, Justin_o, with the extra column, the description gets awfully narrow\xe2\x80\xa6
2015-11-24T21:07:14 <anastasiac> hm
2015-11-24T21:08:00 <Justin_o> anastasiac: yah :(
2015-11-24T21:08:04 <Justin_o> unfortunate side effect
2015-11-24T21:08:05 <anastasiac> Justin_o: I wonder if we could somehow combine the two bits of info (env var and config path) into a single column, without it being confusing
