2015-12-21T11:06:04 <jhernandez> Bosmon2: morning SIR!
2015-12-21T11:06:12 <jhernandez> quick question
2015-12-21T11:06:46 <jhernandez> in the same way we have a gpii.start function, can we have a gpii.stop one?

2015-12-21T11:42:25 <amatas> kasparnet, preferences.gpii.net should work fine now
2015-12-21T11:42:45 <kasparnet> amatas: awesome - just tried it out and everything seems to work properly! Thanks

2015-12-21T14:07:18 <Justin_o> jhung: let me know what you think of that
2015-12-21T14:08:56 <jhung> Justin_o: thanks. I\'ll take a look.
2015-12-21T14:09:03 <Justin_o> jhung: thanks

2015-12-21T14:25:02 <jhung> Justin_o: I was giving the html document some thought over the weekend. I\'m going to send my thoughts as a reply to my email to list.
2015-12-21T14:25:13 <Justin_o> jhung: sure
2015-12-21T14:25:15 <Justin_o> sounds good
2015-12-21T14:25:24 <Justin_o> jhung: is it about the structure?
2015-12-21T14:29:03 <jhung> Not directly Justin_o.
2015-12-21T14:29:15 <Justin_o> jhung: by the way i\'m planning on using Infusion for mocking up the dynamics of our John Travoltage HTMl mockup... do foresee any issue with doing that?
2015-12-21T14:30:08 <jhung> Justin_o: good question. I\'m not sure about that.
2015-12-21T14:30:29 <jhung> Seems like a question for PhET? colinclark may have some input too?
2015-12-21T14:31:06 <Justin_o> jhung: i\'m thinking this is all "throw away" as they already handle most of that stuff. And that this is just for testing purposes.
2015-12-21T14:31:38 <Justin_o> when we go to do the actual implementation we\'ll have to make use of their framework hooks and vanilla javascript, i believe.
2015-12-21T14:31:48 <jhung> Well\xe2\x80\xa6 just wait until I write my email Justin_o. I\'m thinking it may be a good idea to preserve what we\'re working on.

2015-12-21T16:47:26 <colinclark> I would like to
2015-12-21T16:47:29 <colinclark> which means there\'s a chance
2015-12-21T16:47:48 <colinclark> but there\'s a lot to do today!

2015-12-21T17:24:12 <jhung> colinclark: I\'ve been doing some thinking about this HTML version of the John Travoltage sim Justin_o and I are building. I was going to send a message to the list, but wanted to get your thoughts on it first. I\'m proposing that we keep this HTML version of the sim as an alternative to graphical sim.
2015-12-21T17:26:09 <jhung> I think it\'d be particularly useful for situations where there is low processor power. Also some people may just prefer a simple HTML version over the graphical version.
2015-12-21T17:27:09 <jhung> Have two versions also makes it useful in content matching.
2015-12-21T17:44:59 * michelled joined the channel
2015-12-21T17:50:35 <colinclark> jhung: I\'ll respond in a few minutes, sorry for the delay
2015-12-21T17:50:36 <colinclark> just on a call
2015-12-21T17:50:55 <jhung> No worries colinclark.
2015-12-21T17:51:46 <Justin_o> jhung: playing with the html version i made, am noticing that mouse changes don\'t fire a change event until the mouse is released.
2015-12-21T17:52:26 <Justin_o> this is okay for the current sim, but would be a problem if we have the "HTML" only version
2015-12-21T17:52:26 <jhung> Justin_o: oh interesting.
2015-12-21T17:53:25 <Justin_o> jhung: we might be able to do something with the mouse events, but i\'m not sure how brittle that would be. I\'m trying to see if there are any other events that might be fired by the input
2015-12-21T17:53:26 <jhung> It might still be okay Justin_o. Basically it would mean they would not get a description of their relative position until button release.
2015-12-21T17:54:12 <Justin_o> jhung: well it would mean if they rapidly rub the foot on the floor it would build up any charge
2015-12-21T17:55:01 <jhung> ^ but that\'s what we want\xe2\x80\xa6. unless you meant to say "Would not"
2015-12-21T18:05:34 <Justin_o> meant to say would not
2015-12-21T18:05:35 <Justin_o> oops
2015-12-21T18:05:45 * alanharnum joined the channel
2015-12-21T18:06:07 <jhung> Ah. I see now that\'s problematic.
2015-12-21T18:06:33 <Justin_o> jhung: anyways, seems that the  "input" event would work for this, not sure the browser support though
2015-12-21T18:06:51 <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: the design crit is starting
2015-12-21T18:07:50 * alanharnum joined the channel
2015-12-21T18:08:00 <jhung> cool Justin_o, let me know what you find.
2015-12-21T18:40:56 <sgithens> jhernandez kasparnet, sorry i\'ve been missing in action. I am going to get to email soon

2015-12-21T19:00:41 <Justin_o> jhung: seems that the basic support is fairly good https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/input
2015-12-21T19:01:34 <jhung> Mobile support is good too Justin_o. Excellent.
2015-12-21T19:03:23 <Justin_o> jhung: cool, i\'ll continue working on my experiments with the "input" even then instead of the "change" event
2015-12-21T19:04:19 <jhung> awesome. thanks Justin_o
