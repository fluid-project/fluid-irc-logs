b"2015-04-08T18:22:00 <Justin_o> Bosmon: would you like to talk about the new framework changes at next weeks or the following weeks community meeting?
2015-04-08T18:25:29 <Bosmon> Justin_o - sure
2015-04-08T18:25:37 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks
2015-04-08T18:25:53 <Justin_o> do you have a preference for which (april 15 or april 22)?
2015-04-08T18:26:05 <Bosmon> Hopefully there's nothing particularly unexpected... other than it happening a little sooner than I feared : P
2015-04-08T18:26:08 <Bosmon> 15th is good
2015-04-08T18:31:57 <Justin_o> Bosmon: cool thanks :)

2015-04-08T14:39:19 <anastasiac> cindyli, in the language panel branch (FLOE-281), what happened to the welcome screen?
2015-04-08T14:39:42 <cindyli> the welcome screen is goine
2015-04-08T14:39:50 <cindyli> anastasiac: replaced by the language panel
2015-04-08T14:40:18 <cindyli> anastasiac: let me know if you wanna keep the welcome screen and where to show it
2015-04-08T14:40:31 <anastasiac> oh. cindyli, I thought that the welcome screen was supposed to stay, but just to happen after the language panel. danaayotte, can you confirm?
2015-04-08T14:41:34 <cindyli> anastasiac, does it mean the language panel should appear without having the navigation bar?
2015-04-08T14:41:43 <danaayotte> cindyli anastasiac we should include it if we can - comes right after the language panel
2015-04-08T14:42:27 <cindyli> anastasiac, danaayotte, i think showing the language panel without the nav bar is low priority
2015-04-08T14:42:31 <anastasiac> cindyli, I believe we\xe2\x80\x99d like the language panel to not have the nav bar, but that\xe2\x80\x99s not really the top priority. I think getting the language panel to actually do something is higher priority
2015-04-08T14:42:40 <danaayotte> agreed anastasiac
2015-04-08T14:43:52 <cindyli> ok, anastasiac and danaayotte, if that\'s the case, danaayotte, can you add the icon for the language panel into the font bundle, or you already did?
2015-04-08T14:44:25 <danaayotte> it should be there cindyli
2015-04-08T14:45:07 <cindyli> oh, actually we need the icon for the welcome panel since it was using the icon for the language panel
2015-04-08T14:45:13 <cindyli> danaayotte: ^
2015-04-08T14:45:50 <danaayotte> cindyli, there is no icon for the welcome page (because it\'s not a preference screen)
2015-04-08T14:46:21 <cindyli> danaayotte: so the welcome page is supposed to show without the nav bar?
2015-04-08T14:46:46 <cindyli> that\'s the same complexity of showing language panel without a nav bar
2015-04-08T14:46:57 <danaayotte> yup cindyli, for now I think we\'ll just have to show the welcome page with the nav panel below, but without any caret indicator
2015-04-08T14:47:20 <danaayotte> is that doable?
2015-04-08T14:50:09 <cindyli> it\'s certainly doable, danaayotte. i\'m just thinking which one is easier, hiding the nav bar or showing the nav without having the corresponding icon :)
2015-04-08T14:50:22 <danaayotte> I see cindyli
2015-04-08T14:52:07 <danaayotte> just an idea off the top of my head cindyli - could we put a blank icon in the space between the language icon and the voicing icon? that fits into the gap between them?
2015-04-08T14:52:23 <danaayotte> so it would indicate that we\'re in between those two screens
2015-04-08T14:52:52 <danaayotte> anastasiac ^
2015-04-08T14:54:21 <anastasiac> danaayotte, cindyli, I\xe2\x80\x99m liking the idea of either a blank icon or \xe2\x80\x93 at least for now \xe2\x80\x93 a temporary placeholder icon.
2015-04-08T14:54:27 <cindyli> danaayotte: yes, i\'m also thinking the same way, having an empty div without an actual icon. another thing is we need to deal with the active states like the yellow arrow etc. i think we can use css to deal with those
2015-04-08T14:54:42 <anastasiac> ultimately, we want no icons, so let\xe2\x80\x99s not spend too much time on the temporary solution
2015-04-08T14:55:00 <anastasiac> we could use a smiley face :-)
2015-04-08T14:57:53 <danaayotte> not to frown on smiley faces ( :) ), but I think it would be better to have no icon if we can do it - I think having an icon for the welcome screen could get confusing in terms of tracking progress and the corresponding list of preferences on the confirmation page
2015-04-08T14:58:13 <danaayotte> anastasiac, cindyli ^
2015-04-08T14:59:10 <anastasiac> I was kind of joking :-) An empty space would be good. And it should be pretty easy, I think
2015-04-08T15:02:03 <danaayotte> :) :) :)
2015-04-08T15:03:00 <anastasiac> cindyli, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to help out with whatever styling, etc. is needed for the empty space
2015-04-08T15:19:33 <cindyli> thanks, anastasiac and danaayotte
2015-04-08T15:23:05 <Justin_o> danaayotte: i was just looking over the congratulations designs with cindy. i have the page itself implemented but wanted to hook it up the the first discovery tool before sending a pull request
2015-04-08T15:23:47 <Justin_o> however, i\'m now wondering about a few things. 1) are there supposed to be tooltips on the congratulations page 2) is it supposed to support self voicing?
2015-04-08T15:23:58 * slim_jim has quit
2015-04-08T15:26:09 <danaayotte> it should definitely support self-voicing Justin_o. and yes, tooltips for the buttons would be good ( I guess there\'s just help and close). for the close button the tooltip can be "close this window now" (matches the prompt text)
2015-04-08T15:26:31 <Justin_o> danaayotte: okay..

2015-04-08T15:53:48 <anastasiac> michelled, do you think we\xe2\x80\x99ll have time to meet before the community meeting? Or will we be meeting instead of, or after, the community meeting?

2015-04-08T15:56:00 <cindyli> danaayotte: what are the tooltip contents for the up and down buttons on the language panel?
2015-04-08T15:59:37 * kasparnet joined the channel
2015-04-08T16:04:02 <michelled> anastasiac: I think it will be before the community meeting
2015-04-08T16:04:34 <danaayotte> cindyli, they both can say "select to view more languages" (I\'m struggling to find a word other than "view" or "see"...) "select for more languages" doesn\'t seem as clear. any suggestions anastasiac, Justin_o?
2015-04-08T16:05:02 <anastasiac> \xe2\x80\x9cselect for more language choices\xe2\x80\x9d ?
2015-04-08T16:06:14 <anastasiac> danaayotte, cindyli: the up/down buttons will not be accessible to non-sighted users, right? they\xe2\x80\x99re not in the tab order?
2015-04-08T16:06:41 <cindyli> anastasiac, danaayotte, no, they are not accessible by keyboard
2015-04-08T16:07:04 <danaayotte> right, so maybe "select to view more languages" is ok
2015-04-08T16:07:12 <cindyli> ok. got it
2015-04-08T16:07:13 <kasparnet> Bosmon, jhernandez, colinclark: arch meeting

2015-04-08T16:25:37 * the-t-in-rtf has quit
2015-04-08T16:40:28 <Justin_o> danaayotte: so the congratulations page is styled differently from all the others.. this is part of the reason why we had been implementing it separate from the first discovery tool, but it seems that with sharing the language selection and self voicing, it might be easier if it were integrated
2015-04-08T16:40:40 * colinclark has quit
2015-04-08T16:40:44 <Justin_o> danaayotte: i\'m wondering if we can make the style more closely resemble that of the rest of the tool
2015-04-08T16:41:58 * slim_jim joined the channel
2015-04-08T16:42:57 <danaayotte> how do you mean it\'s styled differently  Justin_o? do you mean it doesn\'t have the frame/nav bar etc?
2015-04-08T16:46:38 <Justin_o> danaayotte: yes
2015-04-08T16:48:35 <danaayotte> sure Justin_o, that should be ok. so that means the navigation bar will remain, and will show all the icons still, right? is that true for the confirmation page too?
2015-04-08T16:48:54 <danaayotte> oh nevermind, yes of course it is
2015-04-08T16:49:02 <danaayotte> I was looking at an older design :)
2015-04-08T16:49:08 <Justin_o> danaayotte: probalby , but we\'re not sure we\'ll be getting to the confirmation page
2015-04-08T16:49:13 <danaayotte> ok
2015-04-08T16:49:29 <Justin_o> danaayotte: i\'m thinking i should remove the turn voice on/off button though
2015-04-08T16:49:40 <Justin_o> but otherwise leave the header there
2015-04-08T16:49:45 <danaayotte> yeah, that makes sense ot me
2015-04-08T16:50:03 <Justin_o> danaayotte: okay, thanks
2015-04-08T16:50:10 <danaayotte> so, to confirm, the congrats page will show all the icons?
2015-04-08T16:50:19 <Justin_o> danaayotte: yes
2015-04-08T16:50:25 <Justin_o> is that okay?
2015-04-08T16:51:16 <danaayotte> I think that\'s fine.
