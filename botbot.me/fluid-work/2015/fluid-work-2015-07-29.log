2015-07-29T17:25:57 <michelled> anastasiac: in between your writing tasks, are you able to pick up Bosmon's VP branch and try to assess how much more work there is before VP will work?
2015-07-29T17:26:36 <anastasiac> michelled, sure.
2015-07-29T17:38:50 * kasparnet has quit
2015-07-29T17:44:16 <michelled> anastasiac, perhaps you can start by arranging a meeting with Bosmon and cindyli so we can try to get a task list together
2015-07-29T17:44:35 <anastasiac> good idea, michelled

2015-07-29T17:46:20 <Justin_o> there are some more issues that we've uncovered. Let us know if you need help reproducing any of them
2015-07-29T17:46:32 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I have seen them, yes - thanks for the testing
2015-07-29T17:46:39 <Bosmon> Are there more to come or is this it for now?
2015-07-29T17:46:42 <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: I think we'll pause testing for https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/591 after the smoke tests and unit tests are finished
2015-07-29T17:47:15 <Justin_o> Bosmon: here are the state of the tasks so far https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Testing+Tasks
2015-07-29T17:47:53 <Justin_o> anastasiac, maozillah: do you have any more issues coming, and when do you think you'll be wrapped up the smoke test tasks?
2015-07-29T17:48:15 <anastasiac> Justin_o: I should be able to get through the Chrome tests pretty soon
2015-07-29T17:48:34 <maozillah> Justin_o: just working through manual right now, not sure about a time estimate, but probably shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be too long

2015-07-29T19:19:45 <jhung> flex layout FTW maozillah :)
2015-07-29T19:20:05 <maozillah> ooh what\xe2\x80\x99s the tag for that?
2015-07-29T19:20:08 <maozillah> or semantics*
2015-07-29T19:20:15 <jhung> Let me see...
2015-07-29T19:21:29 <jhung> If you look on the .docs-template-container class, you will see display: flex, and flex-wap: wrap; maozillah.
2015-07-29T19:22:09 <maozillah> ooo cool thanks
2015-07-29T19:22:27 <jhung> Then all I had to do was set widths for the header, sidebar, and articleBody and Flex takes care of the layout maozillah.
2015-07-29T19:29:08 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I'm noticing a problem with your TTS tests when run in the QUnit composite test runner
2015-07-29T19:29:29 <Bosmon> It seems that it doesn't like tests which start to run so late after the page load....

2015-07-29T13:28:46 <Justin_o> I see that your branch is ready for testing again today.. I\'ll try to organize some testing once more people have rolled in.
2015-07-29T13:28:57 <Justin_o> Bosmon: ^
2015-07-29T13:29:06 <Bosmon> Thanks, Justin_o
2015-07-29T13:29:34 <Justin_o> Bosmon: by the way, i saw your comment to cindyli about prefs framework tests and them being quite different in your branch
2015-07-29T13:30:05 <Justin_o> should we be trying to get any outstanding Prefs Framework related pulls in ahead of time, or should we actually hold off till after.. what is your suggestion?

It would be great to have everyone pitch in to help with this process again. As before, you can find the tasks on the wiki https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Testing+Tasks. If you find a bug that is only present in the pull request, please leave a comment
2015-07-29T14:11:13 <Justin_o> on the pull request. If it is a bug that also appears in master, please file the issue in jira.

2015-07-29T14:13:53 <Justin_o> anastasiac: http://tor1-tst-app01.inclusivedesign.ca/
2015-07-29T14:27:47 <alanharnum> Justin_o cindlyli murilocrivellari sepideh: https://gist.github.com/waharnum/4c814b7b50157be2dba4 - I wrote up a text summary of yesterday\'s conversation about the non-sonic aspects of the chart authoring interaction
2015-07-29T14:28:25 <alanharnum> can you have a quick look & let me know if anything\'s missing that we talked about?
2015-07-29T14:34:25 <murilocrivellari> hi alanharnum, thanks for your notes. Just one comment: if I\'m not wrong, values can be either greater or equal 0. We decided not to have negative values though
2015-07-29T14:34:40 <alanharnum> thanks - that\'s correct. will update
2015-07-29T14:35:07 <alanharnum> & add this to wiki once others have weighed in if that makes sense
2015-07-29T14:35:14 <Justin_o> alanharnum: i\'m thinking that the focus was on the chart and legend as a whole to get the overall description and that drilling down would be to the legend.
2015-07-29T14:35:59 <Justin_o> meaning that the legends elements will be focusable and navigation will be via the arrow keys
2015-07-29T14:36:17 <Justin_o> also the total will be navigable in this fashion as well
2015-07-29T14:36:25 <alanharnum> yeah that sounds right - updating
2015-07-29T14:40:18 <sepideh> alanharnum: great notes! one comment : for Data Entry, I am not sure if hovering over a legend row should highlight the corresponding chart and legend element. It may be better to keep that functionality just for the focus. thoughts murilocrivellari?
2015-07-29T14:40:49 <alanharnum> sepideh: yeah I remember that we discussed this & that was the conclusion - focus only, not hover
2015-07-29T14:40:51 <alanharnum> updating :)
2015-07-29T14:41:03 <sepideh> thanks
2015-07-29T14:44:07 <murilocrivellari> I\'m a little late but, yes, indeed sepideh :)
2015-07-29T14:44:38 <clown> simonjb:  did you want copies of the payloads themselves in the email?
2015-07-29T14:44:50 <Justin_o> alanharnum, murilocrivellari, sepideh: could we collect this information and the designs into the wiki
2015-07-29T14:44:54 <sepideh> thx murilocrivellari
2015-07-29T14:45:35 <simonjb> clown: no, just the URLs are good, thanks!
2015-07-29T14:46:07 <clown> cool, simonjb
2015-07-29T14:46:48 <michelled> colinclark, simonjb: kasparne_ and I have just reworked the security demo script. can you take a look at it? we removed the section about Easit since it was demoed last year and no longer seems all that compelling. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BN3j2N00QB4kvFoRLHaUYSAxn7sUYeMCWL6vaH70KUQ/edit#
2015-07-29T14:46:49 <murilocrivellari> sounds great to me Justin_o
2015-07-29T14:47:07 <colinclark> reading it now, michelled
2015-07-29T14:47:44 <colinclark> It looks like you can resolve manuel\'s comment now, kasparne_
2015-07-29T14:51:41 <colinclark> ack i just made an accidental change and can\'t revert, kasparne_ :P
2015-07-29T14:52:52 <simonjb> michelled: this is demo 5? the summary discussed easit and a machine without GPII installed
2015-07-29T14:53:28 <simonjb> then the story discussed NVDA
2015-07-29T14:55:38 <michelled> ah, thanks for catching that simon - we wrote the summary yesterday and changed our minds today
2015-07-29T14:55:44 <michelled> I crossed out the easit section
2015-07-29T14:55:55 <simonjb> michelled: I see your updates :)

2015-07-29T14:57:00 <colinclark> it seems awesome
2015-07-29T14:58:09 <michelled> thanks colinclark
2015-07-29T14:58:47 <Bosmon> Hi cindyli, anastasiac, michelled - so my "smoke test ready" branch of the VP is ready: https://github.com/amb26/videoPlayer/tree/VP-297
2015-07-29T14:59:03 <anastasiac> Bosmon, wonderful! How did it go?
2015-07-29T14:59:19 <Bosmon> anastasiac - well, it doesn\'t work - but I think it doesn\'t work about as well as your original branch didn\'t :)
2015-07-29T14:59:50 <Bosmon> I\'ve updated access to all framework features to the upcoming branch, added grunt tasks for linting and checked linting, and got to the point where a few tests pass
2015-07-29T15:00:31 <Bosmon> Mostly just the isolated ones for MenuButton and ToggleButton
2015-07-29T15:00:59 <Bosmon> The VP itself fails to start up because it is apparently waiting for an event named "onMediaReady" which noone ever fires
2015-07-29T15:01:12 <Bosmon> So I assume that was the point you had got to when you abandoned your original branch
2015-07-29T15:04:48 <jessm> everyone: http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/07/28/15-of-americans-dont-use-the-internet-who-are-they/

2015-07-29T15:13:10 <the-t-in-rtf1> Very interesting.  I wish they had included the type of information they covered here:  http://www.pewinternet.org/2012/04/13/digital-differences/
2015-07-29T15:13:57 <jessm> the-t-in-rtf1: yes, i think this is a refresh of numbers from that report? it isn\xe2\x80\x99t as thorough for sure
2015-07-29T15:14:30 <the-t-in-rtf1> Yes, they left out disability.  I would also be interested in seeing the global equivalents.
2015-07-29T15:14:51 <jessm> +1
2015-07-29T15:14:53 <the-t-in-rtf1> But the key points (poverty, rural areas) are still pretty relevant.
2015-07-29T15:15:03 <jessm> age is an interesting one
2015-07-29T15:15:06 <jessm> for many of our projects
2015-07-29T15:15:08 <the-t-in-rtf1> definitely.
2015-07-29T15:16:32 <the-t-in-rtf1> Age is the one I use to show people the true potential of AT.  The market for reading fine print on a mobile device is larger than the market for mobile games.

2015-07-29T15:20:04 <the-t-in-rtf1> I kind of wonder about the 3% under 30 that don\'t have internet, I\'m assuming that\'s down to income.  I wish they shared a bit more about their methodology.
2015-07-29T15:20:31 <the-t-in-rtf1> Or the data, that would be nice.
2015-07-29T15:21:17 <the-t-in-rtf1> Anyway, thanks for the link, that was a good way to get inspired for the week.
2015-07-29T15:22:05 <jessm> cool. yeah, the methodology is weak. our colleague Jim Tobias is always hounding them for more information about method and i think he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t gotten much
2015-07-29T15:24:07 <the-t-in-rtf1> They do share some of their datasets, but this doesn\'t seem to be one.
2015-07-29T15:25:18 <the-t-in-rtf1> They are horribly organized, but I occasionally will spend an evening picking through one of the many datasets here: https://open-data.europa.eu/en/data/
2015-07-29T15:26:04 <the-t-in-rtf1> It\'s tough to tease out real data about needs, as it tends to be heavily skewed towards medical treatment or employment
2015-07-29T15:28:03 <jessm> open data is so cool

2015-07-29T15:53:44 <alanharnum> 3% under 30 is almost certainly income
2015-07-29T15:54:07 <alanharnum> i\'d also be interested in what their definition of "don\'t use the internet" is
2015-07-29T15:55:01 <alanharnum> we had a lot of experiences when I was working in front-line public library service of people who "don\'t use the internet" - except that they\'d be directed to us for internet access to fill out government forms, etc

2015-07-29T16:08:02 <Bosmon> maozillah - the most basic kind of test you can perform on something, is to plug it in and see whether it immediately catches fire or explodes : P
2015-07-29T16:08:32 <maozillah> ahhhh check for smoke :P

2015-07-29T16:18:22 <Justin_o> Bosmon: great description by the way

2015-07-29T16:39:23 <alanharnum> this is long, but quite fascinating as a history / future speculation: http://allisonrandal.com/2015/07/22/the-future-of-open-source/
