2015-01-14T14:43:23 <Bosmon> Sorry, ^^^^ spaces from **CATTE** :)
2015-01-14T14:43:31 <cindyli> :)
2015-01-14T14:43:47 <cindyli> thanks for the pull request for 5585
2015-01-14T14:43:58 <cindyli> rmb i was saying in the progress of creating another jira
2015-01-14T14:44:04 <Bosmon> yes
2015-01-14T14:44:11 <Bosmon> I am eagerly awaiting it
2015-01-14T14:44:16 <cindyli> after trying more, i found it\'s actually the same issue as 5585
2015-01-14T14:44:34 * danaayotte joined the channel
2015-01-14T14:44:35 <cindyli> means i didn\'t explicitly call "delete"
2015-01-14T14:44:41 <Bosmon> oh great!
2015-01-14T14:44:49 <Bosmon> 2 for the price of 1
2015-01-14T14:44:53 <cindyli> nice.
2015-01-14T14:45:16 <Bosmon> soon I can return to your earlier JIRAs : P
2015-01-14T14:46:04 <cindyli> that would be great, Bosmon, but i feel it\'s a bit hard to keep track on the removals of the nodes on the model and call "delete" whenever that happens
2015-01-14T14:46:30 <Bosmon> cindyli - how could you have an alternative?
2015-01-14T14:46:34 <Bosmon> And also - when are nodes deleted?
2015-01-14T14:46:38 <cindyli> you know we have a selection tree with checkboxes that users can check or uncheck
2015-01-14T14:46:41 <Bosmon> I thought the structure of the graph is fixed
2015-01-14T14:46:55 <cindyli> every uncheck would cause the deletion of some nodes
2015-01-14T14:47:09 <Bosmon> That seems like a very peculiar representation
2015-01-14T14:47:19 <Bosmon> Surely an uncheck just causes a group of flags to be set or unset
2015-01-14T14:47:41 <cindyli> when we send data to the server, we only send true nodes
2015-01-14T14:47:51 <cindyli> i mean checked, or selected prefs
2015-01-14T14:47:55 <Bosmon> Yes
2015-01-14T14:48:17 <Bosmon> I don\'t think we need to bear the responsibility for maintaining the server\'s model via live relay
2015-01-14T14:48:31 <Bosmon> Especially since it is only sent to the server once on submission
2015-01-14T14:48:53 <cindyli> i see your point. that\'s a work around
2015-01-14T14:49:17 <Bosmon> It would be much more straightforward just to write a function which converts the model in its entirety into the other form
2015-01-14T14:49:27 <Bosmon> And I thought that Justin_o already had one
2015-01-14T14:50:34 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes, i have one of those
2015-01-14T14:50:35 <cindyli> yes, it\'s there. but it\'s still a limitation
2015-01-14T14:51:49 <cindyli> the limitation i mean to explicitly specify "DELETE" when having less nodes in the model
2015-01-14T14:52:20 <Bosmon> Well, I\'m not completely clear what the limitation is : P
2015-01-14T14:52:29 <Bosmon> To me it seems perfectly natural to issue "DELETE" when you want fewer things : P
2015-01-14T14:53:35 <Bosmon> Also, we cut down on the number of different operations that the ChangeApplier and all of its listeners need to respond to
2015-01-14T14:53:50 <Bosmon> A "REPLACE" can be modelled in terms of a "DELETE" and a "MERGE"
2015-01-14T14:53:53 <Bosmon> But not vice versa
2015-01-14T14:54:13 <Bosmon> That is, if we only had "DELETE" and "REPLACE", we couldn\'t then implement "MERGE" out of these
2015-01-14T14:54:32 <Bosmon> So to me it seems that the "REPLACE" operation is the one that is redundant
2015-01-14T14:57:16 <cindyli> Bosmon: the model transfomation and relay are meant to transform one model structure to another structure. if the transformation causes the deletion of some nodes on the target stucture, this change needs to be manually detected and fire a DELETE request. one more layer for deletion but not for adding and modifying
2015-01-14T14:58:03 <Bosmon> cindyli - I think we\'d need to work through some examples
2015-01-14T14:58:15 <cindyli> ok
2015-01-14T14:58:15 <Bosmon> But the issue might be that you are trying to use the modelListener infrastructure to achieve relay
2015-01-14T14:58:18 <Bosmon> Which is not what it is meant for
2015-01-14T14:58:39 <Bosmon> modelListeners really are only intended for notifying material that lies completely outside the model system
2015-01-14T14:59:10 <cindyli> understand. i will experiment more with transformation and relay
2015-01-14T15:01:01 <Bosmon> Similarly, the only people firing ChangeRequests should be people who are listening to material outside the model system

2015-01-14T16:30:49 <kasparnet> Bosmon: Hola ARNTVARNICK
2015-01-14T16:31:16 <kasparnet> so, dont know if you saw the issue posted by christoffer Friberg to the arch. list an hour or ago
2015-01-14T16:31:31 <kasparnet> we\'re having quite a few issues with the settings checker
2015-01-14T16:31:51 <Justin_o> cindyli: i\'ve updated the name of the data directory in my GPII-1033 branch
2015-01-14T16:32:05 <cindyli> thanks, Justin_o, merging in..
2015-01-14T16:32:05 <kasparnet> in particular for the XML and INI settingshandler, for which everything is basically strings
2015-01-14T16:32:14 * danaayotte has quit
2015-01-14T16:32:20 <Bosmon> Yes, I saw the issue
2015-01-14T16:32:32 <Bosmon> I thought that jhernandez had a branch for it
2015-01-14T16:33:17 <kasparnet> I\'m pretty sure there is still an issue - but I guess it might be less problematic
2015-01-14T16:33:31 <jhernandez> Bosmon: a branch for WHAT?
2015-01-14T16:33:33 <jhernandez> :P
2015-01-14T16:33:39 <Bosmon> jhernandez - your NUMBERIFY thing
2015-01-14T16:33:46 <kasparnet> for the XML settingshandler
2015-01-14T16:34:13 <jhernandez> yeah, but I don\'t think it was a proper solution
2015-01-14T16:34:52 <kasparnet> do you remember the issue we had in athens, jhernandez.. I dont quite recall the cause of it... the one we encountered after applying your fix
2015-01-14T16:35:01 <jhernandez> because boolean values were giving more problems

2015-01-14T16:37:45 <jhernandez> let me check again what was the problem with that
2015-01-14T16:38:49 <kasparnet> looks like thanos filed a JIRA: http://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-1048
2015-01-14T16:39:20 <jhernandez> that\'s it

2015-01-14T16:52:01 <Bosmon> colinclark, kasparnet, cindyli, Justin_o - I\'m just working on http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5584
2015-01-14T16:52:09 <Bosmon> Perhaps you have a preference for one or other name for this new method
2015-01-14T16:52:39 <Bosmon> I am kicking around possibilities such as accumulateConsumerReject, accumulateConsumerRejection, accumulateRejectReason, accumulateRejectionReason
2015-01-14T16:53:32 <colinclark> You wouldn\'t consider "add" instead of "accumulate?"
2015-01-14T16:53:45 <colinclark> The latter name, RejectionReason is my preference
2015-01-14T16:53:52 <colinclark> though I\'d rather it be addRejectionReason()
2015-01-14T16:54:04 <Bosmon> add seems odd - since it has one already
2015-01-14T16:54:12 <Bosmon> To me "add" has the connotation "add what isn\'t there already"
2015-01-14T16:54:49 <amatas> kasparnet: I\'m talking with Avtar about the preferences server update
2015-01-14T16:55:01 <Bosmon> or - "add in addition to what is there"
2015-01-14T16:55:21 <Bosmon> Rather than "replace what is there by another instance which may or may not incorporate the information that was there already"
2015-01-14T16:55:56 <colinclark> I can\'t say that the word accumulate conveys that point any more to me
2015-01-14T16:56:21 <Bosmon> ok
2015-01-14T16:56:30 <Justin_o> Bosmon: what does this thing do exactly?
2015-01-14T16:56:35 <Bosmon> Justin_o - see JIRA
2015-01-14T16:56:41 <Bosmon> ^
2015-01-14T16:56:56 <colinclark> "gather" and "acquire" seem to be the key words defining "accumulate"
