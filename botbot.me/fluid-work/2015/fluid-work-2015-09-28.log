2015-09-28T17:31:17 <cindyli> sorry, avtar
2015-09-28T17:31:32 <avtar> i think alanharnum, gtirloni, and i were supposed to chat at 2:00

2015-09-28T18:18:02 <Justin_o> cindyli:
2015-09-28T18:18:11 <Justin_o> okay, but your room still seems locked to me
2015-09-28T18:18:19 <avtar> same here
2015-09-28T18:18:22 <Justin_o> it's working now
2015-09-28T18:36:57 <danayo> hi kasparnet, i added a comment here with link to wireframes https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-1195 let me know if you need me to further simplify - it sounds like you probably just want that first dialog box? not sure how much detail you want to give the user
2015-09-28T18:39:10 <kasparnet> awesome! Thanks danayo! yeah - I think the first slide will be all we implement for the review - we're quite strapped on PCP resources
2015-09-28T18:39:35 <kasparnet> I'll let you know if anything changes - but I'm pretty sure this should be sufficient
2015-09-28T18:39:50 <danayo> great, sounds good
2015-09-28T18:43:26 * Bosmon7 has quit
2015-09-28T18:43:44 <danayo> actually kasparnet I just realised that if it's going to be limited to that first dialog, it needs a bit of adjusting - the try different is not intended to be interactive there - it just provides info to the user about how to access it within the PCP (on a pref by pref basis)  - it sounds like what you want is only that first dialog, with option to try different or undo at that point, right?
2015-09-28T18:44:14 <kasparnet> yeah, exactly
2015-09-28T18:53:14 <danayo> got it kasparnet, I'll modify it - should be quick
2015-09-28T19:10:01 <colinclark> Justin_o: I just saw your note from earlier
2015-09-28T19:10:15 <colinclark> Tell me more about your interest in sinon.js?
2015-09-28T19:11:57 <Justin_o> colinclark: mostly that it appears to be able to mock functions fairly easily. For which you could check if it is called, and what parameters were passed and etc.

2015-09-28T20:55:25 <jhung> ok. Either way I'm interested in hearing about that.
2015-09-28T20:56:09 <colinclark> Okay, I'll let you know when I hear back from him

2015-09-28T11:56:23 <the-t-in-rtf> Is there a way to remove material from a child component\'s options using Fluid IoC?  I have a compound component that I want to reuse, but want to get rid of some of its child components.
2015-09-28T11:56:57 <the-t-in-rtf> My gut feel is that I need to break out the compound thing into two flavors, one without the extras, and one with them.

2015-09-28T13:21:43 <Bosmon7> the-t-in-rtf - your gut instinct referred to before is correct
2015-09-28T13:22:03 <Bosmon7> The cleanest factoring, when it is possible that some material is absent in some variant, is for there to be a base grade where it is absent
2015-09-28T13:22:24 <Bosmon7> But without this factoring, you can take your chances with stopgap schemes such as replacing the material with "null" etc.
2015-09-28T13:26:02 <Bosmon7> One day we may implement a custom syntax allowing options to be removed in a more principled way - in fact we have just had some new ideas about how to achieve this recently
2015-09-28T13:26:09 <Bosmon7> By means of what could be called a "local merge policy"
2015-09-28T13:28:16 <the-t-in-rtf> Thanks, my inner Andy was already telling me the solution was to more clearly separate responsibilities.
2015-09-28T13:28:50 <the-t-in-rtf> I may not listen to him until I finish the screen shots for the F2F, with the null workaround I can get those in a minute or two\xe2\x80\xa6. ;)
2015-09-28T13:35:43 <Bosmon7> Yes, it\'s nice
2015-09-28T13:35:51 <Bosmon7> Actually I got a brief note from Andy last week
2015-09-28T13:35:58 <Bosmon7> He says he\'s taken a job in London for a while
2015-09-28T13:36:04 <Bosmon7> Hopefully I could get to see him again sometime
2015-09-28T13:39:16 <the-t-in-rtf> Good to hear.
2015-09-28T13:39:31 * alanharnum joined the channel
2015-09-28T13:39:38 <the-t-in-rtf> The null option dutifully failed.  The framework rejects more and more of my slovenly practices every day.
2015-09-28T13:40:01 <the-t-in-rtf> I ended up adding a createOnEvent option that points to an event that is never fired.
2015-09-28T13:41:01 <the-t-in-rtf> as in: { events: { never: true}, components: { deadToMe: { createOnEvent: "never" } } }

2015-09-28T13:43:36 <Bosmon7> the-t-in-rtf - ah, sorry
2015-09-28T13:43:42 <Bosmon7> It wasn\'t clear to me that you were trying to remove a COMPONENT
2015-09-28T13:44:03 <Bosmon7> The standard scheme for doing that is to override it with a component which has type: fluid.emptySubcomponent

2015-09-28T13:44:18 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: I\'m starting to use gpii-express for a small server side for the first discovery tool. I need to be able to accept a post of the users preferences, which will later get relayed to the preferences server via the security layer. Wondering what the best approach for this would be. I\'m assuming I\'d need to use a contentAware router that accepts
2015-09-28T13:44:18 <Justin_o> JSON. How would I ensure that the the request method is a POST?
2015-09-28T13:45:20 <the-t-in-rtf> your gpii.express.router grade should have the option "method" : "post"
2015-09-28T13:45:32 <the-t-in-rtf> it must be lower case as it points to methods used within express
2015-09-28T13:45:42 <the-t-in-rtf> unlike the conventions with $.ajax
2015-09-28T13:45:50 * colinclark joined the channel
2015-09-28T13:46:56 <the-t-in-rtf> That will ensure that the request is a POST by not listening for anything else\xe2\x80\xa6 :)
2015-09-28T13:47:05 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: ah great, thanks.
2015-09-28T13:47:09 <the-t-in-rtf> They will get a 404 from express if they try something else.
2015-09-28T13:47:36 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: perfect, that\'s exactly what I want :)
2015-09-28T13:48:41 <the-t-in-rtf> I have been working on JSON schema validation middleware which rejects invalid submissions before your component ever sees it.
2015-09-28T13:49:09 <the-t-in-rtf> it means you can write fairly trusting components and let their bodyguard deal with the riff raff.
2015-09-28T13:49:28 <the-t-in-rtf> We should catch up after the F2F when I have an ounce of breathing room.
2015-09-28T13:51:11 * anvk joined the channel
2015-09-28T13:53:02 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: validation would be really helpful, but I think i\'ll be in pretty good shape with what\'s here. Thanks for the help. Good luck with the face to face. I think avtar is planning a chat with you about these things. I\'m planning to sit in on that too.

2015-09-28T17:03:10 <jhung> the Video Details panel shows up on Windows Chrome danayo
2015-09-28T17:03:34 <jhung> Ah. Could it be you selected "Create new resource"?
2015-09-28T17:04:31 <Justin_o> danayo: also, do you have time to carry on the conversation with cindyli and I that we started in the floe meeting regarding the demo link page
2015-09-28T17:05:04 <jhung> In that case you have to add a an URL into the "Web address for video" field and press OK. The URL can be fake too.
2015-09-28T17:05:07 <jhung> ^danayo
2015-09-28T17:05:44 <jhung> On the demo itself there\'s no clear indication of this, but the Overview Panel has instructions.
2015-09-28T17:06:42 <danayo> jhung: i tried both editing as well as create new
2015-09-28T17:06:57 <danayo> i tried adding a fake URL
2015-09-28T17:07:06 <danayo> the panel didn\'t show up at all
2015-09-28T17:07:25 <Justin_o> danayo: that\'s strange, was it your machine or someone else\'s?
2015-09-28T17:07:30 <danayo> someone else\'s
2015-09-28T17:07:41 <jhung> could it be the screen was too small? In that case the video details panel appears below the content danayo
2015-09-28T17:08:02 <danayo> hmmm...it was projected onto a screen in the room
2015-09-28T17:08:32 <jhung> ah that might be the case then danayo. Unless it was a higher resolution projector, there\'s a good chance it appeared below.
2015-09-28T17:08:58 <danayo> ah, ok, thanks jhung
2015-09-28T17:09:32 <jhung> It\'s just a guess danayo but seems like a likely explanation.
2015-09-28T17:11:14 <danayo> yeah, that\'s probably it jhung. i hadn\'t looked at it in a while and forgot that it could appear below - interesting tho -  it\'s very easy to miss - I wonder if there\'s something we can add to make it more obvious
2015-09-28T17:11:32 <danayo> something to think about anyway
2015-09-28T17:12:34 <jhung> I agree danayo. Thanks for pointing it out.
2015-09-28T17:12:53 <danayo> Justin_o cindyli do you want to meet now?
2015-09-28T17:13:16 <cindyli> i can meet now, danayo
