b'2015-07-03T16:54:12 <clown> just asking joanie (the main orca developer).
2015-07-03T16:55:35 <clown> she asking me which version of orca.  I said F22 was just installed, and apparently that enough info for her.
2015-07-03T16:55:36 * anvk joined the channel
2015-07-03T16:55:46 <amatas> Insert+Q to quit Orca
2015-07-03T16:55:52 <clown> try super+alt+s
2015-07-03T16:56:03 <amatas> or killall orca in a shell
2015-07-03T16:56:31 <clown> or control-c if it\'s not running in the background.
2015-07-03T16:56:45 <simonjb> ok, it\'s safe to just kill the process?
2015-07-03T16:56:50 <clown> joanie says that insert+q is way old.
2015-07-03T16:57:12 <clown> and only works for non-gnome desktops.
2015-07-03T16:57:16 <clown> F22 is gnome.
2015-07-03T16:57:40 <clown> asking joanie about control-c.
2015-07-03T16:57:41 <simonjb> ok, just killed with Ctrl-C
2015-07-03T16:57:49 <simonjb> will try tests again...
2015-07-03T16:57:52 <clown> there is a however...
2015-07-03T16:58:39 <clown> quoting joanie:  "if you do that speech-dispatcher bugs may lead to orca not saying anything "  where "that is control-c".
2015-07-03T16:58:59 <clown> "if that occurs, pkill -9 speech*"
2015-07-03T16:59:13 <amatas> up, good to know
2015-07-03T16:59:49 <clown> amatas:  yes.  Filing that trick away for future use.
2015-07-03T17:00:36 <clown> simonjb, the next fail  is Xrandr at 144.  I raised and jira for that, and a pull request.
2015-07-03T17:00:46 <clown> *a jira
2015-07-03T17:00:53 * clown looks up jira.
2015-07-03T17:01:30 <clown> simonjb: https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-1168
2015-07-03T17:03:22 <clown> actually, simonjb, could you do me a favour, if you have a moment?
2015-07-03T17:09:06 <simonjb> clown, amatas: with running orca manually, I\'m now making it through the orca failure but still failing and getting stuck on Xrandr
2015-07-03T17:09:30 <simonjb> clown: yep, what\'s up?
2015-07-03T17:09:50 <clown> simonjb:  said above that I filed a jira agaisnt that failure and a pull request.
2015-07-03T17:09:58 <clown> https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-1168
2015-07-03T17:10:38 <clown> related to that jira, do you know how to get to the Display control panel on F22?
2015-07-03T17:10:42 <clown> simonjb ^
2015-07-03T17:11:00 <simonjb> clown: the regular gnome one? if so, yes
2015-07-03T17:11:40 <clown> okay, go there and see how many screen resolutions are available.
2015-07-03T17:12:09 <clown> On F21 with the latest VirtualBox, only one is available.
2015-07-03T17:12:19 <clown> I am curious if things have changed with F22.
2015-07-03T17:12:26 <simonjb> clown: only one -- the current dimensions of the VM window
2015-07-03T17:12:43 <clown> thanks simonjb!
2015-07-03T17:12:54 <clown> that matches my findings when I filed the jira.
2015-07-03T17:13:19 <clown> *if* you want to patch your system with my pull request, that will get past this unit test failure.
2015-07-03T17:13:22 * alanharnum joined the channel
2015-07-03T17:13:48 <simonjb> clown: pull 68?
2015-07-03T17:14:06 <clown> simonjb, yes.
2015-07-03T17:14:20 <clown> https://github.com/GPII/linux/pull/68
2015-07-03T17:14:21 <simonjb> cool, I\'ll merge that in and see where that gets me
2015-07-03T17:14:34 <simonjb> thanks!
2015-07-03T17:15:55 <clown> simonjb, no problem.
2015-07-03T17:16:01 <clown> glad to be of help.
2015-07-03T17:17:24 <clown> simonjb, brb.
2015-07-03T17:19:42 * clown is back
2015-07-03T17:21:56 <clown> simonjb, out interest, the version of virtualbox I use is 4.3.28.  Is that the one you are using?
2015-07-03T17:24:05 <simonjb> clown: I have guest additions 4.3.28 but VirtualBox 4.3.20
2015-07-03T17:24:51 <simonjb> I\'m using the packaged VirtualBox from my OS (openSUSE) which is at 4.3.20
2015-07-03T17:25:08 <simonjb> but I need the latest guest additions for FF22
2015-07-03T17:25:15 <simonjb> F22
2015-07-03T17:25:33 <clown> simonjb:  thanks.  I\'m running VB using my Mac.  I guess they are further along.
2015-07-03T17:25:59 * clown checks his guest additions.
2015-07-03T17:26:55 <amatas> I think the latest guest additions are 4.3.28
2015-07-03T17:27:00 <clown> simonjb:  yes, I\'m using guest additions 4.3.28 as well.  (no surprise).
2015-07-03T17:27:01 <clown> right.
2015-07-03T17:29:37 <clown> simonjb:  I just noticed all the "PackageKit" unit tests in your gist of the test log.  That means the device reporter is part of your GPII.
2015-07-03T17:29:38 <simonjb> clown, amatas: with klown/GPII-1168 merged, the unit tests are now all passing
2015-07-03T17:29:51 <clown> \\o/
2015-07-03T17:29:54 <simonjb> thanks!
2015-07-03T17:30:06 * clown is inclined to celebrate by going and eating lunch.
2015-07-03T17:30:07 <clown> :-)
2015-07-03T17:30:07 <simonjb> I\'ll update my notes
2015-07-03T17:30:15 <simonjb> thanks clown
2015-07-03T17:30:17 <amatas> good!
2015-07-03T17:30:22 <simonjb> next acceptance tests
2015-07-03T17:30:28 <jessm> alanharnum: lemme know when you wanna chat
2015-07-03T17:30:33 <jessm> no hurry
2015-07-03T17:30:34 <clown> you\'re welcome simonjb
2015-07-03T17:30:49 <simonjb> clown: do you anticipate any issues with the acceptance tests?
2015-07-03T17:30:58 <amatas> clown: bon appetit :)
2015-07-03T17:31:12 <alanharnum> jessm: ok will do
2015-07-03T17:31:24 <clown> simonjb:  thinking (trying to recall the acceptance tests).
2015-07-03T17:31:42 <simonjb> no worries, I\'ll find out soon enough :)
2015-07-03T17:32:06 <clown> yes, and perhaps is I should make my escape re: lunch before they fail.  ;-)
2015-07-03T17:32:32 <clown> amatas:  thanks, re:  "bon appetit".
2015-07-03T17:33:23 <clown> well, I\'m going to just run them here and see if that triggers any memories, simonjb
2015-07-03T17:33:51 <simonjb> clown: thanks very much, but please do go have lunch
2015-07-03T17:34:50 <clown> simonjb, okay.  I have run the Acceptance tests here and they passed.
2015-07-03T17:34:57 <clown> just another data point....
2015-07-03T17:35:02 <simonjb> awesome
2015-07-03T17:35:07 <clown> "datum" point?
2015-07-03T17:37:22 <clown> okay, be back in a bit.
2015-07-03T17:41:08 <simonjb> gtirloni, alanharnum: I\'ve now got the GPII unit tests passing under Fedora 22 and have updated my notes at https://gist.github.com/simonbates/df4a3723beba3143c7ba
2015-07-03T17:41:19 <alanharnum> awesome
2015-07-03T17:44:29 <avtar> simonjb: did orca create any files or directories in your ~ directory that weren\'t present by default?
2015-07-03T17:45:53 <simonjb> alanharnum, gtirloni, clown, amatas: acceptance tests also passing
2015-07-03T17:48:44 <simonjb> avtar: I\'m seeing ~/.local/share/orca but I\'m not 100% certain that that wasn\'t there -- but from what clown and amatas said, I think there\'s a good chance that it wasn\'t -- but I would need to revert to an earlier snapshot to verify (which is very easy)
2015-07-03T17:50:05 <avtar> simonjb: i ask because testing for that will come in handy when automating this work
2015-07-03T17:50:17 <simonjb> avtar: agreed
2015-07-03T17:51:11 <avtar> ~/.local/share/orca is probably a good guess though
2015-07-03T17:51:54 <clown> simojb, alanharnum, gtirloni, amatas, avtar, confirming that ~/.local/share/orca is created the first time orca runs.
2015-07-03T17:52:13 <clown> by orca.
2015-07-03T17:53:06 <avtar> clown: thanks :)
2015-07-03T17:53:21 <clown> avtar, you\'re welcome.
2015-07-03T17:58:39 <simonjb> clown, avtar: I updated my notes with the directory location https://gist.github.com/simonbates/df4a3723beba3143c7ba clown, can you verify? the first point under Unit tests near the bottom
2015-07-03T18:01:05 <clown> simonjb, alanharnum, gtirloni, amatas, avtar, I\'ve confirmed with joanie that running orca in the usual way (the way GPII does), it only creates the directory "~/.local/share/orca/", and the files therein.
2015-07-03T18:01:24 <clown> I assume GPII is not running it in "debug mode"?  If so, orca will create a debug log file.
2015-07-03T18:01:44 <clown> simonjb, I will look at your gist now.
2015-07-03T18:02:53 <clown> simonjb:  LGTM
2015-07-03T18:03:00 <simonjb> thanks
2015-07-03T18:03:28 <clown> wlcm
2015-07-03T18:05:16 <avtar> simonjb: your notes look great
2015-07-03T18:09:55 <avtar> clown, simonjb: do your virtualbox settings for the fedora VMs include any specific audio controllers?
2015-07-03T18:10:35 <clown> avtar, I don\'t recall doing anything special for audio.  But, I\'ll take quick look at the current settings
2015-07-03T18:12:00 <simonjb> avtar: ICH AC97
2015-07-03T18:12:44 <avtar> ok. i\'m assuming if that\'s disabled then the orca related tests (or others) will fail?
2015-07-03T18:12:55 <clown> avtar, the current audio settings are:  1. Enable Audio is checked, 2. Host Audio Drivers (a menu):  s "CoreAudio", and 3. Audio Controller (a menu) is: ICH AC97"
2015-07-03T18:13:16 <clown> avtar, dunno.
2015-07-03T18:14:23 <clown> maybe some will, like volume.  But that depends on whether the test is: "did the setting change", or "did the audio device change".

2015-07-03T14:53:09 <simonjb> hey gtirloni
2015-07-03T14:53:16 <gtirloni> hi simon
2015-07-03T14:53:57 <simonjb> gtirloni: after our conversation, I went ahead yesterday and created a Fedora 22 VirtualBox VM by hand -- without vagrant
2015-07-03T14:55:01 <simonjb> gtirloni: I\'d like to switch over to using vagrant if we can get it to work, but I figured I would move ahead without and I was thinking that my experience doing it by hand might be useful for the vagrant build
2015-07-03T14:55:59 <simonjb> I\'m now at the point where I have the VM running and have dependencies installed; GPII seems to build cleanly but the tests are failing -- that\'s where I am at right now
2015-07-03T14:56:44 <gtirloni> cool, so you can continue the work with any blockers. i\'ll continue the work on vagrant/packer and figure out some differences between workstation/server that got me stuck yesterday. hopefully we\'ll be able to tie this in jenkins and have automated builds
2015-07-03T14:56:59 <gtirloni> re: tests failing, if it\'s something i can help with.. just let me know
2015-07-03T14:57:38 <simonjb> I will, thanks, and likewise if you hit something that I might have done please let me know
2015-07-03T14:57:50 <gtirloni> thanks, will do
2015-07-03T14:57:54 <simonjb> I figured we can work in parallel and then pull the work together
2015-07-03T14:59:05 <gtirloni> i think that\'s wise :)
2015-07-03T15:03:28 <alanharnum> simonjb / gtirloni: after late afternoon convo with avtar yesterday I\xe2\x80\x99m working on some Ansible roles to prepare nodejs environments on Fedora 22 + CentOS - we\xe2\x80\x99ll probably all need to converge at some point :)
2015-07-03T15:04:41 <simonjb> alanharnum: good to know!
2015-07-03T15:05:13 <alanharnum> the new package manager on F22 adds to the fun!
2015-07-03T15:05:56 <simonjb> gtirloni, alanharnum: I will put my notes in configuring up on a gist, in case it\'s useful -- I\'ve got GPII building, but failing tests
2015-07-03T15:06:05 <alanharnum> yeah that would be useful
2015-07-03T15:06:25 <simonjb> I\'ll do that now
2015-07-03T15:06:54 <alanharnum> a next step for me after having a baseline nodejs role is getting some gpii stuff under configuration/deploy management using Ansible
2015-07-03T15:07:04 <alanharnum> so configuring details would be super-useful
2015-07-03T15:08:06 * kasparnet has quit
2015-07-03T15:08:06 <alanharnum> i\xe2\x80\x99m working off the vagrantbox at https://atlas.hashicorp.com/boxcutter/boxes/fedora22 as my testing environment - will switch to the one gtirloni is building once that\xe2\x80\x99s in place

2015-07-03T15:47:05 <simonjb> hi Bosmon, Bosmon7: is Javi available at all? I\'m seeing some test failures on Linux and was hoping to get some help debugging
2015-07-03T15:58:15 * avtar joined the channel
2015-07-03T16:00:16 * anastasiac joined the channel
2015-07-03T16:03:50 * gtirloni joined the channel
2015-07-03T16:33:56 <amatas> Hi gtirloni, I just read the last messages of this channel. I\'m curious, what are you using to setup a Windows+GPII VM?
2015-07-03T16:34:55 <simonjb> hi clown, I\'ve just set up a Fedora 22 VM for GPII and while GPII seems to build cleanly, I am having troubles with tests/UnitTests.sh -- I was wondering if you might be able to help?
2015-07-03T16:35:15 <amatas> I\'m doing some research about how to setup a bunch of PCs that are installed in some libraries.
2015-07-03T16:35:19 <gtirloni> hi alfredo! avtar mentioned yesterday that it\'d be nice to have that automated for windows but we\'re not there yet. i hope packer.io might be useful there and ansible\'s support for windows (alan mentioned yesterday)
2015-07-03T16:35:50 <gtirloni> i\'ve not worked with ansible+windows yet though..
2015-07-03T16:36:20 <gtirloni> if that doesn\'t work, i\'d check using powershell with ps-remoting to do whatever is needed to get gpii and configure it
2015-07-03T16:36:20 <avtar> amatas, gtirloni: ansible support for windows involves writing ansible modules in powershell
2015-07-03T16:36:37 <amatas> avtar: that was I was going to say
2015-07-03T16:36:47 <alanharnum> yeah i don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s hugely mature yet
2015-07-03T16:36:48 <amatas> ansible for windows uses winrm and powershell scripts
2015-07-03T16:37:17 <clown> simonjb, just noticed your message.  *reading*
2015-07-03T16:37:29 <clown> simonjb, sure.
2015-07-03T16:37:42 <avtar> amatas: check out this repo https://github.com/joefitzgerald/packer-windows/tree/master/scripts
2015-07-03T16:37:43 <gtirloni> i read somewhere windows/powershell is getting ssh support too, besides winrm/winrs.. not sure if that\'s for win10 only though
2015-07-03T16:37:43 <alanharnum> avtar: what\xe2\x80\x99s the version of node we should be freezing on? 1.10?
2015-07-03T16:37:53 <avtar> they use a mix of powershell and batch scripts to provision windows vms
2015-07-03T16:37:55 <alanharnum> (for the node role)
2015-07-03T16:37:56 <simonjb> clown: that would be awesome
2015-07-03T16:38:15 <simonjb> clown: do tests/UnitTests.sh run successfully for you?
2015-07-03T16:38:16 <gtirloni> alanharnum, gpii/infusion works with 0.10.36 for now
2015-07-03T16:38:24 * clown gets his VM up in front of him
2015-07-03T16:38:32 <gtirloni> alanharnum, it\'s the latest on centos (and fedora, curiously)
2015-07-03T16:38:52 <avtar> alanharnum: the latest version of 0.10.*
2015-07-03T16:39:04 <avtar> and what gtirloni said :P
2015-07-03T16:39:11 <clown> simonjb, they did at one point.  I think about a month ago.
2015-07-03T16:39:22 <clown> Are a lot failing?
2015-07-03T16:39:27 <clown> Or is there  specifie one?
2015-07-03T16:39:27 <alanharnum> ok makes life easier, i misunderstood the conversation with avtar :P
2015-07-03T16:39:27 <gtirloni> basically what i said s/36/\\*/g :)
2015-07-03T16:39:32 <alanharnum> it won\xe2\x80\x99t be the first time
2015-07-03T16:39:59 <avtar> alanharnum: basically the most recent version of node, 0.12.*, won\'t work with gpii at the moment
2015-07-03T16:40:13 <alanharnum> ok
2015-07-03T16:40:16 <amatas> thanks avtar!
2015-07-03T16:40:24 <alanharnum> as long as the current fedora one is ok :P
2015-07-03T16:40:39 <clown> simonjb, I have not updated to F22 yet.  I\'m still running F21.  Not sure that\'s factor though.
2015-07-03T16:40:52 <gtirloni> i\'d expect fedora to ship the latest and greatest, but i guess the io.js situation made them wait
2015-07-03T16:41:09 <simonjb> clown: I\'m seeing a small number of failures but I\'m also seeing a small number of tests running -- I\'m either getting stuck or running _very_ slowly
2015-07-03T16:42:30 <simonjb> clown: I can post my test output somewhere and maybe you could take a look? are you able to run the tests in your F21 VM?
2015-07-03T16:42:40 <clown> simonjb, you are running the latest master code, right?  I\'m not up to date yet, since the device reporter code was just merged into master recently (this morning?).
2015-07-03T16:43:01 <clown> simonjb, re: posting: sure.
2015-07-03T16:43:14 <simonjb> clown: yes, I\'m running master
2015-07-03T16:43:43 <clown> simonjb:  and that includes the "new" device reporter?
2015-07-03T16:45:08 <simonjb> clown: https://gist.github.com/simonbates/1d796a08d5b4a938a70b
2015-07-03T16:45:21 <simonjb> and regarding "new" device reporter, I have no idea
2015-07-03T16:45:45 <simonjb> the tests were started almost 2 hours ago and are still running
2015-07-03T16:46:32 <amatas> simonjb: do you have orca installed?
2015-07-03T16:46:38 <simonjb> clown: and in case it\'s helpful, here are my notes on setting up the vm: https://gist.github.com/simonbates/df4a3723beba3143c7ba
2015-07-03T16:46:55 <clown> simonjb, regarding that slowness, I noticed earlier that you had allocated 20gb to your virtual hard drive.  I always allocate 64gb when I set up a new fedora virtual box machine.
2015-07-03T16:47:02 <clown> maybe that has something to do with slowness?
2015-07-03T16:47:29 <clown> at the moment, my f21 actual usage is 19.79 gb.
2015-07-03T16:47:38 <clown> Mind, I have numer GPII branches on that vm.
2015-07-03T16:47:43 <clown> *numerous
2015-07-03T16:48:39 <simonjb> I think the disk is ok -- I\'ve got 12GB available on /
2015-07-03T16:48:50 <simonjb> amatas: /usr/bin/orca
2015-07-03T16:49:26 <simonjb> amatas: are there maybe specific orca packages I could be missing? a devel package?
2015-07-03T16:49:41 <clown> ok, simonjb, the first failure I see has to do with orca.  Line 92.
2015-07-03T16:49:47 <amatas> simonjb: it seems that orca hasn\'t create the user\'s local config, try to run orca one time and then try to run the tests again
2015-07-03T16:50:00 <clown> I *think* you have to launch orca once "by hand" to create a user-conf for it.
2015-07-03T16:50:26 <clown> it appears amatas and clown think alike...
2015-07-03T16:50:44 <simonjb> ah, interesting, will try that now -- just run /usr/bin/orca ?
2015-07-03T16:50:44 <amatas> hehe you\'re right clown
2015-07-03T16:51:25 <clown> simonjb, the "correct" way is to launch it from the accessibility menu (that\'s what the gnome ui developers would say).  But, from the command line is ok too.
2015-07-03T16:52:14 <simonjb> ok, orca started, how to quit?
2015-07-03T16:52:20 <clown> other "correct sanctioned" way is to launch it from the Universal preferences panel in the system settings dialogs.
2015-07-03T16:53:32 <clown> simonjb, I"m trying to remember the magic key press\xe2\x80\xa6
