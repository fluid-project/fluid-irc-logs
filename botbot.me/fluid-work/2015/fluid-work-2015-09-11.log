2015-09-11T20:06:33 <cindyli> jhung: should i send the pull request for ILDH against ur doc-base repo? does doc-base make its way into a fluid project repo?
2015-09-11T20:07:04 <jhung> my repo would be fine cindyli
2015-09-11T20:07:42 <cindyli> jhung: ur master repo was last modified in July
2015-09-11T20:07:53 <cindyli> don\'t find a branch in there
2015-09-11T20:08:00 <cindyli> is this the latest code?
2015-09-11T20:08:08 <cindyli> i mean the master
2015-09-11T20:08:18 <cindyli> https://github.com/jhung/doc-base
2015-09-11T20:08:20 <jhung> cindyli: docs-core and docs-template are the two repos.
2015-09-11T20:08:33 <cindyli> ah ha, not doc-base any more
2015-09-11T20:09:11 <cindyli> got it, my pull request should be for docs-core
2015-09-11T20:09:11 <jhung> cindyli: I should have deleted those repos long ago but kept them "just in case".

2015-09-11T20:09:35 <jhung> thanks! I\'ll delete those repos now. I haven\'t needed them in a month.
2015-09-11T20:29:26 <cindyli> jhung: i was reading this aria example - http://oaa-accessibility.org/example/20/. it seems aria-pressed is not a proper attribute for show/hide button. instead, "aria-expanded" attribute should be used for the region controlled by the show/hide button
2015-09-11T20:29:55 <cindyli> i dug examples because i wasn\'t sure when to set the boolean value for aria-pressed
2015-09-11T20:29:59 <jhung> cindyli: ah. that makes sense since it\'s still visible.
2015-09-11T20:30:40 <cindyli> jhung: we probably should modify the jira
2015-09-11T20:30:48 <cindyli> do you want me to do it?
2015-09-11T20:30:56 <jhung> ok. I can do that cindyli
2015-09-11T20:31:02 <cindyli> thanks, jhung

2015-09-11T14:33:09 <cindyli> hi Bosmon
2015-09-11T14:33:18 <Bosmon> Hi there cindyli
2015-09-11T14:33:34 <cindyli> i have a component with an option defined as,
2015-09-11T14:33:41 <cindyli> messageBase: "{messageLoader}.resources.prefsEditor.resourceText",
2015-09-11T14:34:00 <cindyli> btw, this is defined in the defaults block
2015-09-11T14:34:29 <cindyli> when I wrote the test for this component, i don\'t have messageLoader on the tree, so trying to overwrite this option with
2015-09-11T14:34:36 <cindyli> messageBase: {
2015-09-11T14:34:36 <cindyli> "stepCountMsg": "Step %currentPanel of %numPanels",
2015-09-11T14:34:36 <cindyli> "panelMsg": "This is %stepCountMsg. %instructions Press \'h\' for help."
2015-09-11T14:34:36 <cindyli> },
2015-09-11T14:34:54 <cindyli> however, got error of cannot resolve the reference "{messageLoader}"
2015-09-11T14:35:08 <Bosmon> cindyli - how did you overwrite it?
2015-09-11T14:36:01 <cindyli> Bosmon: the to-be-tested component is tested as a subcomponent on the tree, overwriting it using a subcomponent option
2015-09-11T14:36:10 <cindyli> prefsEditor: {
2015-09-11T14:36:10 <cindyli> type: "gpii.firstDiscovery.tts.prefsEditor",
2015-09-11T14:36:10 <cindyli> options: {
2015-09-11T14:36:10 <cindyli> messageBase: {
2015-09-11T14:36:10 <cindyli> "stepCountMsg": "Step %currentPanel of %numPanels",
2015-09-11T14:36:10 <cindyli> "panelMsg": "This is %stepCountMsg. %instructions Press \'h\' for help."
2015-09-11T14:36:10 <cindyli> },
2015-09-11T14:36:27 <cindyli> "gpii.firstDiscovery.tts.prefsEditor" is what needs to be tested
2015-09-11T14:37:08 <Bosmon> cindyli - you\'ll find that if you put the overriding material into a grade, it will not try to evaluate the original configuration
2015-09-11T14:37:19 <cindyli> ok trying
2015-09-11T14:37:29 <Bosmon> And it\'s clearer to express things as self-contained grades anyway
2015-09-11T14:38:36 <cindyli> that\'s true
2015-09-11T14:43:46 <cindyli> Bosmon: works. thanks!

2015-09-11T15:13:02 <cindyli> Bosmon: is there a reason that the original configuration still gets resolved when the overriding material is from a subcomponent options or other forms of input options, instead of a grade?
2015-09-11T15:13:39 <Bosmon> cindyli - it\'s a little irregular in the framework currently - during grade resolution, merging occurs before expansion
2015-09-11T15:14:00 <Bosmon> But when compositing material from subcomponents or options distributions, merging occurs after expansion
2015-09-11T15:14:34 <cindyli> i see. is this design intentional?
2015-09-11T15:15:14 <cindyli> or they will eventually be consolidated?

2015-09-11T15:56:48 <Bosmon> cindyli - I\'m sorry to say that I\'m not entirely sure
2015-09-11T15:57:24 <cindyli> haha
2015-09-11T15:57:28 <Bosmon> In theory it would be nice to have a model where merging always occurs before expansion
2015-09-11T15:57:39 <Bosmon> But every time I have tried to achieve this in the past it has led to severe problems
2015-09-11T15:57:58 <Bosmon> I don\'t think I will try to do it again until after the next round of framework updates
2015-09-11T15:58:18 <cindyli> understand
2015-09-11T15:58:36 <Bosmon> Although the framework was very different the last time I tried - we had lots of demands blocks that were expecting to resolve references named {options} wholesale
2015-09-11T15:58:46 <Bosmon> Which would have been complete nonsense if merging happened first
2015-09-11T15:59:10 <Bosmon> What we could do is shift subcomponent options into the same merging batch as defaults
2015-09-11T15:59:33 <Bosmon> Which would eliminate the particular problem you just had
2015-09-11T15:59:55 <Bosmon> subcomponent options and user options
2015-09-11T16:00:04 <Bosmon> But options distributions still seem to be a special case
2015-09-11T16:00:25 <Bosmon> The upside is that the framework would become much faster too
2015-09-11T16:00:32 <Bosmon> The fewer merging operations we do "at runtime" the better
2015-09-11T16:00:54 <Bosmon> But it would be a very puzzling a destabilising change to think through when we have so many urgent improvements still to make
2015-09-11T16:00:58 <Bosmon> a -> and
2015-09-11T16:01:50 <cindyli> ok
2015-09-11T16:02:06 <Bosmon> Our problem with "members" is closely related though
2015-09-11T16:02:17 <Bosmon> I was just talking this over with colinclark earlier
2015-09-11T16:02:47 <Bosmon> For some reason, the expectation seems to be that for "members", merging happens AFTER expansion
2015-09-11T16:03:03 <Bosmon> At least, this seems to have been your expectation when you wrote the "initialModel" definition in the prefs framework :)
2015-09-11T16:03:48 <Bosmon> I guess we are still at the "wait and see" stage of trying to understand what behaviour people consider natural, and how we can implement it without confusing them
2015-09-11T16:04:11 <cindyli> :)
2015-09-11T16:04:44 <Bosmon> I mean - how was the framework to know that when you wrote {messageLoader} above, you actually wanted to override the entire definition, rather than merge together with what results it produced?
2015-09-11T16:05:12 <Bosmon> At least today we have SOME way to express the two different intentions, even if it is totally unintuitive
2015-09-11T16:05:59 <Bosmon> One way might be through a "mergePolicy" but these seem too heavyweight
2015-09-11T16:06:10 <Bosmon> Although just this moment the idea has occurred to me of what one might call a "local mergePolicy"
2015-09-11T16:06:23 <Bosmon> That is, something which only talks about the meaning of THE PARTICULAR OPTIONS IN THE SAME GRADE that it is defined in
2015-09-11T16:06:29 <Bosmon> Rather than ALL OPTIONS FOR THAT PATH FROM EVERYWHERE
2015-09-11T16:06:40 <cindyli> agree
2015-09-11T16:07:22 * colinclark joined the channel
2015-09-11T16:08:37 <cindyli> more flexibilities with the current implementation, as long as developers understand which method works in what way :)
2015-09-11T16:09:04 <Bosmon> Yes - we have a similar "unintended flexibility" which occurs with distributeOptions
2015-09-11T16:09:21 <Bosmon> "as it happens", any distributeOptions material you target at an invoker or listener arguments ends up being expanded in the context of the target
2015-09-11T16:09:32 <Bosmon> Whereas all other distributeOptions material is expanded in the context of the component where you wrote it
2015-09-11T16:09:44 <Bosmon> "as it happens" this seems to mostly correspond to what people want
2015-09-11T16:09:59 <Bosmon> But I wouldn\'t want to commit to it as permanent framework behaviour just yet
2015-09-11T16:11:09 <Bosmon> Even though it\'s a really alarming pothole waiting for everyone should we ever change it

2015-09-11T17:46:35 <Bosmon> Priorities need to be numbers
2015-09-11T17:46:39 <Bosmon> The string "10" is not supported
2015-09-11T17:46:41 <cindyli> ah. cool
2015-09-11T17:46:48 <Bosmon> This would have been a bug in the original impl that was not caught
2015-09-11T17:46:59 <cindyli> nice. trying

2015-09-11T18:08:35 <cindyli> Bosmon: i somehow feel the wording of "Invalid priority constraint type in constraint" is confusing. I didn\'t realize it was talking about "priority" field
2015-09-11T18:09:11 <Bosmon> !
2015-09-11T18:11:59 <cindyli> might be me understanding english differently ;)
2015-09-11T18:12:18 <Bosmon> cindyli - how about if it began "Invalid constraint type in priority field " xxx
2015-09-11T18:12:35 <cindyli> certainly better
