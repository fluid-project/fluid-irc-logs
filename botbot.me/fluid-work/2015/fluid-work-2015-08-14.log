2015-08-14T16:04:45 * slim__ has quit
2015-08-14T16:07:38 <Bosmon> slim_ - 0.10.x is currently well-tested
2015-08-14T16:07:48 <slim_> Thanks
2015-08-14T16:07:59 <Bosmon> I\'ve run parts of the architecture fine with 0.12.x, but there may be problems with Windows ffi
2015-08-14T16:08:17 <Bosmon> As part of the big update I\'m making to all the architecture, I\'ll try to move us on to the upcoming "node 4" ........
