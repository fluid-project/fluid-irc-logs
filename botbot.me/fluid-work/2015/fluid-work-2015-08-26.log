b"2015-08-26T17:53:41 <colinclark> I might get you to look it over and add your thoughts :)
2015-08-26T17:53:47 <Justin_o> colinclark: although i'm not sure we should make it a requirement because someone may want to use another unit testing framework
2015-08-26T17:53:59 <colinclark> yes
2015-08-26T17:54:02 <Justin_o> colinclark: sure sounds good
2015-08-26T17:54:02 <colinclark> no reason to make it a requirement
2015-08-26T17:54:28 <colinclark> I really wish jqUnit didn\xe2\x80\x99t depend on Infusion itself
2015-08-26T17:54:31 <colinclark> life would be easier
2015-08-26T17:54:54 <colinclark> but I suppose Bosmon would say the exact opposite
2015-08-26T17:54:55 <colinclark> :)
2015-08-26T17:55:13 <Justin_o> yah, that's true, is it just the IoC test framework that does?
2015-08-26T18:05:51 * colinclark joined the channel
2015-08-26T18:07:04 <colinclark> Justin_o: jqUnit itself also depends on Infusion
2015-08-26T18:07:25 <colinclark> dependency, I guess, is also a sign of usefulness :)

b'2015-08-26T17:17:52 <colinclark> and I think I managed to get my head back around how it all works
2015-08-26T17:17:59 <colinclark> nice that it\xe2\x80\x99s all grunt-based
2015-08-26T17:18:20 <colinclark> the results of our build process strike me as somewhat strange, and I was trying to clearly think through why the are the way they are
2015-08-26T17:18:30 * avtar has quit
2015-08-26T17:19:11 <colinclark> so when you build Infusion, you get a directory containing a) a concatened Infusion JavaScript file and b) a bunch of directories including all the source of Infusion
2015-08-26T17:19:23 <Justin_o> colinclark: yes
2015-08-26T17:19:28 <colinclark> and I was trying to think through what all a user of Infusion needs
2015-08-26T17:19:38 <colinclark> they will typically use a concatted, minified build in their app
2015-08-26T17:19:48 <alanharnum> anastasiac colinclark: this probably ties into a conversation gtirloni avtar & I have been having about managing static sites better
2015-08-26T17:19:58 <colinclark> indeed it does, alanharnum :)
2015-08-26T17:20:04 <alanharnum> and perhaps some of the recent frustrations that i\'v observed over gh-pages :)
2015-08-26T17:20:13 <colinclark> and then they\xe2\x80\x99ll need access to all the templates and css and other resources for components, right, Justin_o?
2015-08-26T17:20:25 * kasparnet has quit
2015-08-26T17:20:40 <colinclark> and I guess there\xe2\x80\x99s one additional caveat to this
2015-08-26T17:20:56 <colinclark> which is that the UIO iFrame template actually links against individual JavaScript files, so they need to be there as well
2015-08-26T17:21:13 <colinclark> Justin_o: so my question is, I guess, are there other components that are like this?
2015-08-26T17:21:37 <Justin_o> colinclark: like UIO?
2015-08-26T17:21:42 <colinclark> yep
2015-08-26T17:21:50 <colinclark> i.e. are there any use cases other than the UIO iFrame where you actually want all (or any) of the individual JavaScript files for the Infusion framework or components?
2015-08-26T17:22:02 <Justin_o> ah
2015-08-26T17:22:49 <Justin_o> i think there might be something that doesn\'t ever get included in the concatenated build, which may be the progressive enhancement stuff, but nothing i can think of that\'s like the iframe case
2015-08-26T17:23:05 <Justin_o> ideally we\'d have a better solution for that anyways.. I\'m guess you\'re thinking we\'d not include those individual files
2015-08-26T17:23:08 <anastasiac> Bosmon: just double-checking the monster docs branch. There\xe2\x80\x99s still one issue that I think we must address: The \xe2\x80\x9cMigrating to Infusion 2.0\xe2\x80\x9d is not appearing visually on the page at all. The link is technically being generated (if you look at the generated markup) but there is no link text, so there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing for the use to see, let alone click on.
2015-08-26T17:23:13 <colinclark> Justin_o: I was sort of thinking of it
2015-08-26T17:23:37 <colinclark> Justin_o: I was imagining, having forgotten most of the details of how our build currently works, that a user would want something like this:
2015-08-26T17:23:44 <Justin_o> colinclark: it might be nice to have an option to keep them, but typically what we do when we use a build of infusion in another repo, is to delete all of those manually. which is a pain.
2015-08-26T17:23:57 <colinclark> ugh, yes
2015-08-26T17:23:58 <colinclark> 1) a concatenated, unminified infusion-<whatever>.js file
2015-08-26T17:24:11 <colinclark> 2) a concatenated, minified version of infusion-<whatever>.js
2015-08-26T17:24:29 <colinclark> 3) directories containing all the static resources for all included components (i.e. html templates and css files)
2015-08-26T17:24:48 <colinclark> 4) directories containing individual JavaScript files for any \xe2\x80\x9cbuggy\xe2\x80\x9d components we have, such as UIO
2015-08-26T17:25:16 <colinclark> I say \xe2\x80\x9cbuggy\xe2\x80\x9d here to indicate that, really, the UIO iFrame should be configured as part of the build process to use a concatted and minified build file, too
2015-08-26T17:25:46 <colinclark> 5) any additional files that can\xe2\x80\x99t be included as part of a build, such as the progressive enhancement stuff
2015-08-26T17:25:51 <colinclark> does that seem right to you?
2015-08-26T17:26:09 <colinclark> In other words, does that correspond to what you don\xe2\x80\x99t delete in your own custom builds of Infusion? :)
2015-08-26T17:26:54 <anastasiac> Bosmon: or not. The link text is there, but it\xe2\x80\x99s below the bottom of the screen, and scrolling doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make it visible, so it\xe2\x80\x99s a CSS problem...
2015-08-26T17:27:47 <Justin_o> colinclark: we have separate builds for minified and unminified
2015-08-26T17:27:56 <colinclark> yes, I noticed that
2015-08-26T17:28:15 <colinclark> it seems very odd, in comparison to what one typically finds in other projects
2015-08-26T17:28:46 <Justin_o> colinclark: i\'d rather keep them separate, it\'s just one more thing i\'d have to manually delete, since it\'s unlikely i\'ll need both
2015-08-26T17:29:04 <colinclark> in practice, which type of build do you use
2015-08-26T17:29:06 <colinclark> ?
2015-08-26T17:29:09 <Justin_o> i suppose they are included in other projects for the package manager issues we were talking about the other day
2015-08-26T17:29:17 <colinclark> yes
2015-08-26T17:29:32 <Justin_o> colinclark: in dev we\'d use the unminified
2015-08-26T17:29:51 <colinclark> how would you manage the switch between versions?
2015-08-26T17:30:11 <anastasiac> Bosmon, it\xe2\x80\x99s the vh height of the infusion-docs-TOC style. I\xe2\x80\x99ll make the fix before I push.
2015-08-26T17:30:11 <colinclark> so, wearing the hat of Justin_o, Third Party Developer Who Uses Infusion\xe2\x80\xa6
2015-08-26T17:30:24 <Justin_o> colinclark: so aside from the concatenated files, i think what you are saying is to keep things the same but to delete the individual js files that are included in the concatenated file and not used by "buggy" components directly.
2015-08-26T17:30:31 <colinclark> yup
2015-08-26T17:30:48 <colinclark> and possibly to include both the minified and non-minified versions, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know
2015-08-26T17:30:55 <colinclark> presumably when you start a project like, say, the Chart Authoring Tool, you first make a custom build of Infusion
2015-08-26T17:31:04 <colinclark> then you copy all the files into the Chart Authoring Tool\xe2\x80\x99s repository
2015-08-26T17:31:09 <Bosmon> anastasiac - OK, I can reproduce that issue in Firefox now, although not in Chrome
2015-08-26T17:31:09 <colinclark> delete all the cruft you don\xe2\x80\x99t want
2015-08-26T17:31:12 <Justin_o> colinclark: i\'d probably do what we do with jQuery and just minify and concatenate it myself as needed.
2015-08-26T17:31:14 <colinclark> and commit it to the repository
2015-08-26T17:31:17 <Bosmon> I\'ll tackle it shortly
2015-08-26T17:31:25 <colinclark> aha, Justin_o, interesting
2015-08-26T17:31:42 <colinclark> so as Developer of the Chart Authoring Tool, you\xe2\x80\x99d probably have your own grunt scripts to concat and minify it?
2015-08-26T17:32:02 <colinclark> for production?
2015-08-26T17:32:03 <Bosmon> Oh anastasiac - you found a simple fix?
2015-08-26T17:32:06 <Bosmon> That\'s great
2015-08-26T17:32:16 <Justin_o> probably, we do something like that for video player i think
2015-08-26T17:32:26 <anastasiac> yes, Bosmon, just testing in different browsers
2015-08-26T17:32:31 <Justin_o> because we\'d want to minify our own code for production anyways
2015-08-26T17:32:38 <colinclark> right
2015-08-26T17:32:39 <colinclark> ok
2015-08-26T17:32:45 <colinclark> So, in a slight twist\xe2\x80\xa6
2015-08-26T17:33:07 <colinclark> how often do you make custom builds of Infusion?
2015-08-26T17:33:28 <colinclark> as opposed to either using a) a framework-only build or b) an \xe2\x80\x9call\xe2\x80\x9d build?
2015-08-26T17:33:52 <Justin_o> every time i need to upgrade for project that i\'m working on, which depending on bug fixes could be very infrequent or quite often
2015-08-26T17:34:01 <Justin_o> oh oops i see
2015-08-26T17:34:04 <Justin_o> almost always
2015-08-26T17:34:11 <colinclark> interesting
2015-08-26T17:34:25 <colinclark> because you cherry pick a subset of the components for a particular project?
2015-08-26T17:34:27 <Justin_o> colinclark: for example we need tooltips or some other infusion component
2015-08-26T17:34:34 <Justin_o> colinclark: exactly
2015-08-26T17:34:40 <colinclark> right, gotcha
2015-08-26T17:35:34 <colinclark> so unless there were some way via npm or some hypothetical web package manager to somehow specify that you want a custom build to be produced as part of a postinstall of Infusion\xe2\x80\xa6
2015-08-26T17:36:01 <colinclark> you\xe2\x80\x99re basically still looking at the scenario of \xe2\x80\x9cbuild, then commit to the project\xe2\x80\x99s repository"
2015-08-26T17:36:13 <Justin_o> colinclark: yes, or take infusion-all
2015-08-26T17:36:17 <colinclark> right
2015-08-26T17:36:34 <colinclark> So you want the build scripts to provide you with the most focused build possible
2015-08-26T17:36:43 <colinclark> i.e. you want to have to not delete cruft from a custom build by hand
2015-08-26T17:37:09 <colinclark> and, more often than not, you want an unminifed build of Infusion, because you\xe2\x80\x99ll do the minification yourself
2015-08-26T17:37:42 <Justin_o> colinclark: yes, although i don\'t know how that process would work with a package manager in the mix. I haven\'t though about it really.. so it might be different in that case
2015-08-26T17:38:05 <colinclark> Justin_o: I think, unless we discover some awesome magic, the package manager scenario just wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t work for your use case
2015-08-26T17:38:29 <Justin_o> :(
2015-08-26T17:38:33 <colinclark> it\xe2\x80\x99s not so bad
2015-08-26T17:38:46 <colinclark> I mean, you live just fine without a package manager now
2015-08-26T17:38:51 <colinclark> it\xe2\x80\x99s not ideal, but it works
2015-08-26T17:39:32 <colinclark> For users of a \xe2\x80\x9ctypical\xe2\x80\x9d build of Infusion (e.g. infusion-framework or infusion-all), the npm package could distribute those builds as part of a prepublish script
2015-08-26T17:40:16 <colinclark> and for more advanced users who are selecting amongst individual components, we have yet to meet a package manager with the capacity to usefully help with this requirement
2015-08-26T17:40:41 <colinclark> you fit into the latter category, Justin_o, as Developer of the Chart Authoring Tool (for example)
2015-08-26T17:41:09 <Justin_o> colinclark: yep, that\'s true
2015-08-26T17:41:42 <colinclark> ok, i think i understand the issues much better now
2015-08-26T17:41:47 <colinclark> thanks for brainstorming with me
2015-08-26T17:42:02 <Justin_o> colinclark: cool, can i ask a question about it?
2015-08-26T17:42:17 <Justin_o> colinclark: when you say "npm package could distribute those builds as part of a prepublish script"
2015-08-26T17:42:24 <colinclark> yup
2015-08-26T17:42:27 <Justin_o> what sorts of things can be done in that script?
2015-08-26T17:42:49 <colinclark> anything
2015-08-26T17:42:50 <Justin_o> could we harness all of the builds features with that?
2015-08-26T17:43:04 <Justin_o> oh i see
2015-08-26T17:43:13 <Justin_o> it\'s publish to the NPM repo, not fetching it down :(
2015-08-26T17:43:17 <colinclark> yes
2015-08-26T17:43:20 <colinclark> that\xe2\x80\x99s a postinstall script
2015-08-26T17:43:25 <Justin_o> can we do that?
2015-08-26T17:43:31 <colinclark> yes, we could
2015-08-26T17:43:38 <anastasiac> Bosmon, colinclark: monster docs branch merged into master, deployed to proper gh-pages and to production site
2015-08-26T17:43:39 <Justin_o> just publish the raw repo as well and require a postinstall script for it
2015-08-26T17:43:51 <colinclark> there are a few issues
2015-08-26T17:43:53 <Justin_o> so have three things published, framework, all, and raw
2015-08-26T17:44:16 <colinclark> Justin_o: I imagine we could, in our grunt script, read a custom property in the user\xe2\x80\x99s package.json
2015-08-26T17:44:30 <colinclark> e.g. infusionBuildOptions or something like that
2015-08-26T17:44:47 <colinclark> and in a postinstall script, if that property is present, do a custom build for the user
2015-08-26T17:44:48 <Justin_o> colinclark: yes, that should be possible
2015-08-26T17:44:53 <colinclark> the caveat is that doing so with Grunt is a bit ugly
2015-08-26T17:44:58 <Justin_o> ah okay
2015-08-26T17:45:15 <colinclark> in that all requisite Grunt dependencies need to be moved from devDependencies to dependencies
2015-08-26T17:45:25 <colinclark> the-t-in-rtf discovered this issue a few weeks ago
2015-08-26T17:45:51 <colinclark> it also, of course, forces anyone npm installing Infusion to have already installed Grunt (I think)
2015-08-26T17:46:09 <colinclark> but there may be a way to execute the postinstall script without using the cli part of grunt, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know
2015-08-26T17:47:35 <colinclark> these aren\xe2\x80\x99t showstoppers, Justin_o, but they are wrinkles
2015-08-26T17:47:39 <colinclark> and I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure how far to take this
2015-08-26T17:47:42 <colinclark> I\xe2\x80\x99m certainly willing to try
2015-08-26T17:47:59 <colinclark> in theory this would allow you, as a consumer of a very custom build of Infusion, to use npm to manage it
2015-08-26T17:48:06 <colinclark> instead of having to keep it in your repostiory
2015-08-26T17:48:40 <Justin_o> colinclark: yes, which would save a lot of time when upgrading to the latest version
2015-08-26T17:49:31 <Justin_o> colinclark: we should also think about including jQunit or having an npm repo for it
2015-08-26T17:49:45 <Justin_o> we seem to always need that and have to pull it in separate because it isn\'t part of a custom build
2015-08-26T17:51:01 <colinclark> I think Bosmon recently recommended that I simply fold jqUnit into Infusion
2015-08-26T17:51:17 <colinclark> since I was trying to get all our Infusion framework unit tests to run in Node.js
2015-08-26T17:51:27 <colinclark> and had trouble dealing with circular dependencies
2015-08-26T17:52:01 <colinclark> how come jqUnit isn\xe2\x80\x99t part of a custom build?
2015-08-26T17:52:09 <colinclark> is it because we elide the tests/ directory or something?
2015-08-26T17:52:14 <Justin_o> colinclark: because it\'s part of the tests directory which isn\'t included
2015-08-26T17:52:19 <Justin_o> yes
2015-08-26T17:52:20 <colinclark> aha
2015-08-26T17:52:29 <colinclark> but in an \xe2\x80\x9call\xe2\x80\x9d build, it is included?
2015-08-26T17:52:38 <Justin_o> colinclark: yes, but not in the concatenated file
2015-08-26T17:52:51 <colinclark> which makes sense
2015-08-26T17:52:56 <colinclark> I don\xe2\x80\x99t want jqUnit shipping with my production app
2015-08-26T17:53:06 <colinclark> but I do want it available nearby so I can test my app with it
2015-08-26T17:53:07 <Justin_o> Bosmon: when you have a chance i left a comment on the FLOE-399 pull request https://github.com/fluid-project/chartAuthoring/pull/3#issuecomment-131403286
2015-08-26T17:53:11 <colinclark> does that sound right to you, Justin_o?
2015-08-26T17:53:19 <Justin_o> colinclark: yes, that\'s right
2015-08-26T17:53:21 <colinclark> ok
2015-08-26T17:53:34 <colinclark> So now my task is to write up a JIRA summarizing everything we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about, Justin_o

2015-08-26T14:31:03 <Bosmon> anastasiac, colinclark - we might be receiving an important new visitor soon, so what say we merge my FLUID-5249 docs branch?
2015-08-26T14:31:20 <Bosmon> We should have docs which reflect the state of trunk, and we can pick up any further issues later
2015-08-26T14:35:25 <colinclark> Bosmon: IMPORTANT NEW VISITOR
2015-08-26T14:36:03 <anastasiac> Bosmon, colinclark, I\xe2\x80\x99d be ok with that, if we ensure that we capture those further issues in JIRAs so we don\xe2\x80\x99t forget them
2015-08-26T14:36:31 <colinclark> Bosmon: I\xe2\x80\x99m also okay with it, having taken a look at some of your improvements
2015-08-26T14:36:37 <colinclark> One question, though
2015-08-26T14:36:59 <colinclark> what\xe2\x80\x99s the process for deploying it?
2015-08-26T14:37:10 <Bosmon> colinclark - I assumed it was deployed automatically
2015-08-26T14:37:14 <Bosmon> gtirloni - is it?
2015-08-26T14:37:14 <colinclark> it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t
2015-08-26T14:37:21 <Bosmon> Ah
2015-08-26T14:37:21 <colinclark> gtirloni was going to look into what we needed to do
2015-08-26T14:37:23 <anastasiac> it\xe2\x80\x99s awkward
2015-08-26T14:37:25 <colinclark> but right now it\xe2\x80\x99s hosted on gh-pages
2015-08-26T14:37:35 <Bosmon> So I needn\'t have paniced at accidentally pushing to master\'s gh-pages then
2015-08-26T14:37:39 <anastasiac> the gh-pages plugin does it, but it does it oddly
2015-08-26T14:37:56 <anastasiac> well, no, Bosmon, your change did affect the public, production view of the docs
2015-08-26T14:38:13 <Bosmon> Oh I see
2015-08-26T14:38:20 <Bosmon> So that *is* the process for deploying it
2015-08-26T14:38:27 <colinclark> That\xe2\x80\x99s how github pages works, yes
2015-08-26T14:38:29 <colinclark> ;)
2015-08-26T14:39:14 * kasparnet joined the channel
2015-08-26T14:40:40 <colinclark> I would really like an automated process where we can have different versions of the documentation published
2015-08-26T14:40:49 <colinclark> each with their own URLs
2015-08-26T14:40:52 <Bosmon> colinclark - ok
2015-08-26T14:41:03 <colinclark> and that a developer should be able to deploy the documentation automatically
2015-08-26T14:41:16 <Bosmon> I guess I understand a little better the vestigial behaviour of the deploy script I saww then
2015-08-26T14:41:17 <colinclark> simply by pushing to a branch or tag
2015-08-26T14:41:21 <Bosmon> It is "trying" to be this
2015-08-26T14:41:47 <Bosmon> I guess there was a missing link my mind in that I assumed there was some further deployment step beyond this one
2015-08-26T14:42:22 <colinclark> I guess we still need to modify the scripts to allow multiple versions to coexist somehow?
2015-08-26T14:42:26 <Bosmon> colinclark - yes
2015-08-26T14:42:58 <Bosmon> It might be quite messy... I guess they will need to "pull down" whatever is in the existing gh-pages branch and then push it back up again
2015-08-26T14:43:13 <Bosmon> Since as far as I\'m aware, the deployment behaviour is to blow away the target branch completely
2015-08-26T14:45:01 <Bosmon> I already had to increase the sophistication of the "file juggling" in the plugin in order to accommodate the "incremental build" system
2015-08-26T14:49:32 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2015-08-26T14:59:37 <Justin_o> avtar, gtirloni: I don\'t remember if we put up the Decapod VM somewhere. We had wanted to make it available after the project ended. I still have a copy lying around that I\'d like to delete from my machine. If it isn\'t up already, where should we put it? Cache fly?
2015-08-26T15:03:08 <avtar> Justin_o: yes, the cdn is probably a good place for it
2015-08-26T15:03:52 <Justin_o> avtar: any thoughts on where to put it on the CDN. I don\'t think we have a Decapod specific site
2015-08-26T15:04:11 <avtar> ah
2015-08-26T15:04:46 <gtirloni> deca what? :)
2015-08-26T15:04:54 <avtar> alanharnum, anastasiac, and i have been using domain names to name directories for project-specific content on the cdn
2015-08-26T15:05:29 <avtar> i guess we need to find a workaround for projects that don\'t have domain names associated with them
2015-08-26T15:05:39 <anastasiac> gtirloni: https://sites.google.com/site/decapodproject/
2015-08-26T15:05:55 <Justin_o> gtirloni: it\'s a bit before your time :) but it was a cool digitization project, jhung can tell you all about it
2015-08-26T15:06:10 <Justin_o> avtar: yah
2015-08-26T15:06:44 <gtirloni> ok, i\'ll check it out
2015-08-26T15:06:59 <gtirloni> as for a VM.. i don\'t know where that might be. i\'ll need to look around
2015-08-26T15:07:05 <gtirloni> avtar, any ideas? :)
2015-08-26T15:07:16 <jhung> gtirloni: It involves books, computer vision, and African Land Snails.
2015-08-26T15:07:23 <avtar> gtirloni: Justin_o has a copy
2015-08-26T15:07:26 <colinclark> LAND SNAILS
2015-08-26T15:07:44 <gtirloni> books i\'m okay with. i\'m afraid of snails though
2015-08-26T15:08:01 <avtar> be fearless
2015-08-26T15:08:13 <jhung> gtirloni: they were as big as your fist.
2015-08-26T15:08:14 <avtar> especially since there are rainforest bugs all around you
2015-08-26T15:08:23 <gtirloni> i\'m glad there are no air snails
2015-08-26T15:08:43 <alanharnum> book digitization? that\'s for nerds and librarians. and librarian nerds.
2015-08-26T15:09:01 * alanharnum puts on sunglasses, then puts on another pair of larger sunglasses on top of them.
2015-08-26T15:09:06 <gtirloni> avtar, i\'ve built a relationship with them. these snails.. don\'t trust them yet
2015-08-26T15:09:35 <avtar> Justin_o: alanharnum recently used a subdirectory named \'vagrant\' for storing linux vagrant boxes. maybe that directory should be renamed \'vms\' and the decapod image could live there?
2015-08-26T15:10:16 <alanharnum> avtar Justin_o: that would be fine with me
2015-08-26T15:10:42 <Justin_o> avtar, alanharnum: are there actually VMs in the vagrant directory or are they the boxes to create them from. The decapod one will be an actual virtualbox VM.
2015-08-26T15:11:17 <gtirloni> jhung, searching for "decapod" on google images doesn\'t show nice things too.. i wonder if the project name might have attracted the land snails :)
2015-08-26T15:11:25 <alanharnum> Justin_o avtar: it\'s the boxes, so maybe make a separate directory if we want to be precise about it
2015-08-26T15:12:13 <avtar> i would vote to just have one vms or virtual_machines directory
2015-08-26T15:12:48 <avtar> since all those files will be related to virtual machines
2015-08-26T15:13:13 <Justin_o> avtar: do you want subdirectories under that then
2015-08-26T15:13:29 <Justin_o> i.e. vagrant, virtualbox, vmware, etc.
2015-08-26T15:14:27 <avtar> we don\'t store any vmware ones yet but that seems like a good idea
2015-08-26T15:14:33 <jhung> gtirloni: Yes. In retrospect we should have chosen a name with a cuter animal.
2015-08-26T15:16:08 <alanharnum> Axolotl!
2015-08-26T15:16:10 <Justin_o> avtar, alanharnum: are you find with me reorganizing stuff on cache fly?
2015-08-26T15:16:12 <alanharnum> aka the pokemon fish
2015-08-26T15:16:29 <alanharnum> Justin_o avtar: yeah that\'s fine - nothing running in production yet
2015-08-26T15:16:43 <avtar> Justin_o: yup
2015-08-26T15:16:56 <Justin_o> thanks, will do
2015-08-26T15:17:11 <avtar> but if you start reorganizing any other directories you may want to give anastasiac a heads-up
2015-08-26T15:17:27 <Justin_o> avtar: okay, i\'ll try to keep it to the vagrant one
2015-08-26T15:24:34 <Justin_o> anastasiac: i left some comments on the FD tutorials doc
2015-08-26T15:24:49 <anastasiac> Justin_o, thanks

2015-08-26T17:12:59 <colinclark> It\xe2\x80\x99d be great to do it soon if possible, anastasiac
2015-08-26T17:13:22 <colinclark> Did we figure out what our process for publishing our documentation will be?
2015-08-26T17:13:30 <colinclark> and who has some time to modify the scripts to support it?
2015-08-26T17:13:59 <anastasiac> colinclark: we haven\xe2\x80\x99t yet worked out how we might improve the process

2015-08-26T17:17:16 <Justin_o> colinclark: sure
2015-08-26T17:17:25 <anastasiac> colinclark, sure, I can look into that later this week or next week
2015-08-26T17:17:30 <colinclark> awesome, thanks anastasiac
2015-08-26T17:17:33 <colinclark> Justin_o: I spent some time poking at our build system last night
