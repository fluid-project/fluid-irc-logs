b'2015-01-13T21:14:13 <Bosmon> cindyli - that would be a more serious breaking change
2015-01-13T21:14:34 <Bosmon> In the new applier, it has been defined that the meaning of changes of type "ADD" is the same as that of the old type "MERGE" which was now abolished
2015-01-13T21:15:01 <Bosmon> We would have to either undo this change and add back "MERGE" or else add in a new event of type "REPLACE" or so

b'2015-01-13T19:12:43 <Bosmon> We\'ll just have to take care to "armour" them back into DELETE requests whenever we try to transmit them to anyone or store them

2015-01-13T19:21:46 * michelled has quit
2015-01-13T19:22:03 <cindyli> thanks, Justin_o, will merge in
2015-01-13T19:22:14 * michelled joined the channel
2015-01-13T19:22:49 <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks, i\'ve added a new js file in the shared directory that has common js methods
2015-01-13T19:23:23 <Bosmon> cindyli - well, we need a way to propagate the information about deletions through essentially arbitrary code
2015-01-13T19:23:29 * michelled has quit
2015-01-13T19:23:30 <Bosmon> For example, the code fluid.identity
2015-01-13T19:23:39 <Bosmon> Now fluid.identity is hardly going to response to a change request of type "DELETE"
2015-01-13T19:23:43 <Bosmon> It has no idea what such things are
2015-01-13T19:23:59 * michelled joined the channel
2015-01-13T19:24:06 <Bosmon> The only thing it can respond to is VALUES.... which implies we must have a VALUE WHICH REPRESENTS A DELETION
2015-01-13T19:24:11 <cindyli> ok
2015-01-13T19:24:17 <Bosmon> Now in JavaScript, our reasonable choices for such a value are extremely limited
2015-01-13T19:24:41 <Bosmon> In theory we could send in some special "exotic" value that we could check with a prototype or constructor check
2015-01-13T19:24:58 <Bosmon> But this seems rather antireligious in some other ways
2015-01-13T19:25:36 * michelled has quit
2015-01-13T19:25:42 <Bosmon> "undefined" has the virtue of meaning almost exactly what we mean - in that after servicing a DELETE, undefined really is the value which we would observe after a read
2015-01-13T19:26:01 <Bosmon> It would just require special processing in the changeApplier to honour it with a language-level "delete" rather than sticking it in as a value
2015-01-13T19:26:02 * michelled joined the channel
2015-01-13T19:26:47 <Bosmon> It would mean that the changeApplier then loses the ability to operate on "broken JSON" trees which hold "undefined" as property values, but it never really had this anyway
2015-01-13T19:27:19 * michelled has quit
2015-01-13T19:27:27 <Bosmon> Actually as the recent GPII settings handler problems demonstrated, 100% of our architecture, as well as our base libraries such as jQuery, lack the ability to process trees like that anyway

2015-01-13T19:36:32 <Bosmon> We have already chosen to use "undefined output value" our convention within the model transformation system to mean "do not propagate any change to output"

2015-01-13T19:44:57 <Bosmon> ok, LOO TIME has brought results
2015-01-13T19:45:09 <Bosmon> I started to think about falling back onto the "exotic value" system
2015-01-13T19:45:15 <Bosmon> but this is also obviously unworkable
2015-01-13T19:45:34 * michelled has quit
2015-01-13T19:45:50 <Bosmon> Imagine something like fluid.transforms.linearScale encountering a value OF ANY KIND representing a deletion
2015-01-13T19:46:00 <Bosmon> It\'s obviously never going to have any idea what to do with it
2015-01-13T19:46:01 * michelled joined the channel
2015-01-13T19:46:54 <Bosmon> Unless we special-case the code in each of our transforms, they\'re obviously going to mishandle it
2015-01-13T19:47:18 * michelled has quit
2015-01-13T19:47:40 <Bosmon> So, this obviously has to be handled (to start with) outside the reach of the model transforms system entirely
2015-01-13T19:47:44 * michelled joined the channel
2015-01-13T19:48:27 <Bosmon> Initially it should just be a primitive of the relay system - that any relay rule that receives a DELETE at source/target should just transfer this by default to a DELETE at the other ened
2015-01-13T19:49:01 * michelled has quit
2015-01-13T19:49:09 <Bosmon> In the future, I guess, we will have to add in some special casing for oddities like transforms which transform undefined ones into defined ones
2015-01-13T19:49:25 <Bosmon> For example, the valueMapper does this in some configurations

2015-01-13T19:52:40 * Sepideh joined the channel
2015-01-13T19:52:46 <Bosmon> Well ok, thinking further, I think I realise we need to do even more
2015-01-13T19:53:08 <Bosmon> *EVERY* relay rule, accepting ANY value of any kind, should immediately begin by deleting the value at the other end - if it thinks it is going to try to relay it
2015-01-13T19:53:31 <Bosmon> Only if it succeeds in reestablishing it should the new value be accepted
2015-01-13T19:53:40 * michelled has quit
2015-01-13T19:53:46 <Bosmon> Actually I think this succeeds in solving all of our problems immediately
2015-01-13T19:53:52 <Bosmon> Including several that we haven\'t run into yet
2015-01-13T19:54:10 * michelled joined the channel
2015-01-13T19:54:43 <Bosmon> However, trying to implement this new aggressive behaviour may well expose several other bugs lying in the system
2015-01-13T19:55:04 <Bosmon> We have been relying, I think, as a kind of "safety net" that the default behaviour of the system is to do nothing, if it encounters some problem with a relay rule
2015-01-13T19:55:22 <Bosmon> But the default behaviour of the system will now be to utterly destroy the value at the other end of a relay rule : P

2015-01-13T20:04:22 <Bosmon> Well
2015-01-13T20:04:26 <Bosmon> We will just have to try it

2015-01-13T20:13:31 <Bosmon> oh dear
2015-01-13T20:13:44 <Bosmon> It appears that an ARCHITECTURAL PROBLEM prevents this simple solution from being very simple
2015-01-13T20:14:12 <Bosmon> I may have to just shelve this as yet another problem to be solved when we rewrite the relay system
2015-01-13T20:14:37 <Bosmon> Unfortunately the system "has no idea" at the level of change events when an instance of relay is beginning and ending
2015-01-13T20:14:58 <Bosmon> What a stupid system
2015-01-13T20:15:08 <Bosmon> All of the relays all funnel through fluid.registerDirectChangeRelay
2015-01-13T20:15:16 <Bosmon> Which all it does is connect an incoming stream of changes on a target
2015-01-13T20:15:30 <Bosmon> This makes it very hard to figure out when to apply the "punctuation" of sending in the DELETE ....
2015-01-13T20:17:29 <cindyli> the good thing is, this jira is not blocking anything. we have time
2015-01-13T20:19:17 <cindyli> also, another change applier jira is on its way, you may wanna see that first before coming up with the solution
2015-01-13T20:19:18 <Bosmon> ok
2015-01-13T20:19:34 <Bosmon> Well, it may be possible to find a quicker path by special-casing the two kinds of transforms
2015-01-13T20:19:47 <Bosmon> I\'ve found the place to punctuate transforms which use a full "modelRelay" record
2015-01-13T20:20:05 <Justin_o> cindyli: I\'ve updated my GPII-1033 branch again with shared renamed to core
2015-01-13T20:20:11 <Bosmon> And if this doesn\'t cause everything to explode, I can try to extend this to relays which just use implicit relay

2015-01-13T16:22:03 <simonjb> Bosmon: I just merged cindyli and Justin_o work into my GPII-17 will merge yours now -- I should merge in your GPII-17 branch?
2015-01-13T16:22:19 <Bosmon> simonjb - sure, yes
2015-01-13T16:23:03 <simonjb> Bosmon: actually, would you mind making a pull request against my GPII-17? thanks
2015-01-13T16:27:01 <Bosmon> Thanks very much for FLUID-5585, cindyli
2015-01-13T16:27:36 <Bosmon> simonjb - https://github.com/simonbates/universal/pull/2
2015-01-13T16:27:48 <Bosmon> I just merged up with your current branch, I think the only conflict was just a linting issue
2015-01-13T16:28:11 <Bosmon> Actually let me relint now
2015-01-13T16:28:24 <Bosmon> oops
2015-01-13T16:28:27 <Bosmon> Sorry, bad merge
2015-01-13T16:28:29 <Bosmon> Wait a sec
2015-01-13T16:30:06 <Bosmon> Ok simonjb - it\'s good now
2015-01-13T16:30:43 <simonjb> great, thanks Bosmon -- will grab and take a look

2015-01-13T17:22:56 <Bosmon> Hi there simonjb - I\'ve fixed the issue with the cloud4chrome solutions entry and added a test case in my GPII-17 branch
2015-01-13T17:23:44 * anastasiac joined the channel
2015-01-13T17:23:52 * avtar joined the channel
2015-01-13T17:28:57 <simonjb> thanks Bosmon
2015-01-13T17:29:03 <simonjb> will test now
2015-01-13T17:37:51 <simonjb> Bosmon: now I\'m getting back { "org.chrome.cloud4chrome": {} } both when I have all selected and when I have just the text size selected
2015-01-13T17:38:57 <Bosmon> simonjb - you mean that all of the preferences are always being filtered out?
2015-01-13T17:38:58 * Sepideh has quit
2015-01-13T17:39:01 <Bosmon> Regardless of the filter setting?
2015-01-13T17:39:10 <simonjb> Bosmon: yes, I think so
2015-01-13T17:40:58 * Sepideh joined the channel
2015-01-13T17:41:00 <Bosmon> Hi there cindyli - thanks for the test case for FLUID-5585
2015-01-13T17:41:12 <Bosmon> Actually the test case is faulty, since the value of the sub model never changes
2015-01-13T17:41:21 <Bosmon> However, although the test case is faulty, the issue really is real ....
2015-01-13T17:41:37 <Bosmon> simonjb - would you like to Skype again?
2015-01-13T17:42:01 <cindyli> checking the test case, Bosmon
2015-01-13T17:42:09 <simonjb> Bosmon: sure
2015-01-13T17:42:23 <Bosmon> cindyli - it\'s ok, I will deal with the issue
2015-01-13T17:42:34 <Bosmon> cindyli - the problem is that the "change" request is accumulative
2015-01-13T17:42:42 <Bosmon> If you want to remove values you need to fire a "DELETE" request
2015-01-13T17:42:53 <Bosmon> however, once I adjusted the test case to do this, the problem remains
2015-01-13T17:43:06 <cindyli> right, exactly, you told me that
2015-01-13T17:43:22 <cindyli> ok. thanks for fixing it up
2015-01-13T17:43:48 <Bosmon> cindyli - is this the same issue that you saw last night, that was preventing you from seeing a change through the relay?
2015-01-13T17:43:51 <Bosmon> or is this a different issue
2015-01-13T17:44:10 <cindyli> no, a different issue. i will create another jira for that, Bosmon
2015-01-13T17:44:51 <cindyli> oh, well, the pull request was for the issue from last night. the issue I mentioned last friday was a different one. another jira and test case are on their way
2015-01-13T17:45:56 <Bosmon> cindyli - ok - so this one is last night\'s issue?
2015-01-13T17:46:11 <cindyli> yes, Bosmon

2015-01-13T18:40:43 <cindyli> simonjb: the chrome issue has been fixed and pushed to my 1060 branch
2015-01-13T18:42:15 <Bosmon> cindyli - what was the cause of the misrendering on chrome?
2015-01-13T18:42:38 <simonjb> cindyli: great, thanks, can you issue a pull request please? at this point it\'s the easiest way for me to manage code additions
2015-01-13T18:43:18 <simonjb> cindyli: against my GPII-17 branch
2015-01-13T18:56:04 <cindyli> sure. simonjb, it\'s \'cuz evt.target from the click event handler returns different targets in firefox and chrome
2015-01-13T18:56:05 <simonjb> Bosmon: we got filtering! if I test against the chrome_high_constrast.json prefs set I see preferences being filtered
2015-01-13T18:56:30 <Bosmon> simonjb - fantastic :)
2015-01-13T18:56:41 <simonjb> I\'ll merge in your changes now and update our test dataStore to use this prefs set instead of chrome1
2015-01-13T18:56:58 <Bosmon> cindyli - I think that FLUID-5585 will be very hard to solve
2015-01-13T18:57:25 <cindyli> oh no, Bosmon
2015-01-13T18:57:29 <Bosmon> cindyli - simonjb showed me a version of the UI where the panel title consisted of an EL expression rather than the title - was this the same issue?
2015-01-13T18:57:42 <cindyli> yes, that was, Bosmon
2015-01-13T18:58:15 <Bosmon> cindyli - how did the event.target difference cause a fault in rendering?
2015-01-13T18:58:59 <cindyli> Bosmon: that EL expression was expecting some data but received undefined

2015-01-13T19:01:02 <cindyli> simonjb: the pull request has been sent against ur GPII-17 - https://github.com/simonbates/universal/pull/3
2015-01-13T19:01:23 * michelled has quit
2015-01-13T19:01:27 <Bosmon> cindyli - the EL expression targetted something that was received from an event?
2015-01-13T19:01:49 * michelled joined the channel
2015-01-13T19:02:16 <cindyli> Bosmon: for the data from the server such as oauth client id etc, they are saved in hidden input fields on the page, as siblings of the edit button for each service.
2015-01-13T19:02:25 <cindyli> the work flow when the edit is clicked is
2015-01-13T19:02:42 <cindyli> find which edit is clicked -> get those data from sibling input fields
2015-01-13T19:02:56 <Bosmon> cindyli - now I understand
2015-01-13T19:02:58 <cindyli> and pass data to the renderer
2015-01-13T19:03:06 * michelled has quit
2015-01-13T19:03:13 <Bosmon> This code will need substantial refactoring before it can reach master : P
2015-01-13T19:03:34 <cindyli> suggestions for improving this workflow, Bosmon?
2015-01-13T19:03:36 * michelled joined the channel
2015-01-13T19:04:49 * michelled has quit
2015-01-13T19:05:02 <Bosmon> cindyli - the oauth server should cease to operate as a "Web 1" host and instead supply HTML templates and JSON payloads
2015-01-13T19:05:17 * michelled joined the channel
2015-01-13T19:05:35 <Bosmon> This approach using a variety of hidden form inputs would be more appropriate for the previous decade : P
2015-01-13T19:05:43 <cindyli> :)
2015-01-13T19:06:32 * michelled has quit
2015-01-13T19:06:46 <Bosmon> We also need to refactor the component so that it has tests which run in the browser
2015-01-13T19:06:56 <cindyli> totally agree
2015-01-13T19:06:56 <Bosmon> For the entire interaction, not just for the selection tree
2015-01-13T19:07:01 * michelled joined the channel
2015-01-13T19:07:09 <Bosmon> We\'ll have a lot of work to do after the review
2015-01-13T19:07:16 <cindyli> yes
2015-01-13T19:07:36 <Bosmon> But hopefully it will not take us 11 months to clean up, as it did for the previous review
2015-01-13T19:07:48 <cindyli> lol
2015-01-13T19:08:07 <Bosmon> Although to be honest we have still not really finished cleaning up from the previous review
2015-01-13T19:10:21 <cindyli> our work is quickly piling up
2015-01-13T19:10:35 <Bosmon> Yes
2015-01-13T19:10:52 <Bosmon> Once this CATT gets off my arm, I will start pacing up and down the house trying to think what to do about FLUID-5585 ....
2015-01-13T19:12:00 <Bosmon> I think we are going to have abandon a previously held dear religion, and start permitting change requests with a value of "undefined" ......
