2015-12-02T17:13:25 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks for merging my pull request... did you get the changes into kettle that we talked about the other day?
2015-12-02T17:13:53 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I have them ready to go, yes
2015-12-02T17:14:19 <Bosmon> I had a query for simonjb but we are in arch meeting right now - but I could just commit them now if you\'d want to take a look within the next hour
2015-12-02T17:15:55 <Justin_o> Bosmon: that\'s okay, i have a pull request i can look at in the time being
2015-12-02T17:16:41 <Justin_o> lliskovoi: I wonder if this might explain the aria-describedby issues you were experiencing http://davidmacd.com/blog/is-tabindex-required-on-describedby.html
2015-12-02T17:19:04 <lliskovoi> thanks Justin_o! I\'ll have a look
2015-12-02T17:22:53 <lliskovoi> Justin_o it worked!
2015-12-02T17:24:12 <Justin_o> lliskovoi: great :)
2015-12-02T17:25:50 <Justin_o> anastasiac: are you change from FLUID-5757 hosted somewhere?
2015-12-02T17:26:03 <Justin_o> that is, are the docs being served up
2015-12-02T17:26:09 <anastasiac> ah, I think I haven\xe2\x80\x99t pushed the latest and greatest\xe2\x80\xa6 hang on
2015-12-02T17:26:16 <Justin_o> anastasiac: thanks
2015-12-02T17:26:51 <Justin_o> anastasiac: and I take it that https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/629 is also ready for review

2015-12-02T17:27:54 <anastasiac> ok, Justin_o, latest tutorial up at http://acheetham.github.io/infusion-docs/infusion/development/tutorial-prefsFramework/CreatingAPrefsEditor.html, goes with the code in #629

2015-12-02T18:05:15 <Bosmon> Hi there Justin_o, simonjb - so I\'ve committed my updates to the KETTLE-32 branch now, most of the changes are supporting Justin_o\'s work via the new "loadConfigs" property, but I\'ve also improved the top-level drivers following feedback from simonjb
2015-12-02T18:06:14 <Bosmon> Note that the old "includes" top-level config option is now gone, and is replaced by two new options, "mergeConfigs" (which has the same behaviour as old "includes") and "loadConfigs" which just loads a config as a grade without merging it with the current config

2015-12-02T21:15:38 <Justin_o> lliskovoi: there are, but they aren\'t up yet. we\'ll be continuing the meeting next week. So i\'m not sure if they\'ll go up this week or after next.
2015-12-02T21:16:42 <lliskovoi> Justin_o gotcha, thanks!

2015-12-02T21:26:08 <jhung> anastasiac: do you have time to help me read over something? I want to make sure it\'s understandable for someone with moderate technical background, but has familiarity of the John Travoltage sim.
2015-12-02T21:26:20 <anastasiac> sure!!
2015-12-02T21:27:22 <jhung> https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/PhET+John+Travoltage+Arm+Implementation+Research
2015-12-02T21:27:26 <jhung> ^ anastasiac
2015-12-02T21:27:47 * ben_s has quit
2015-12-02T21:31:19 <anastasiac> jhung, your spinner jsfiddle link is the same as the slider fiddle, and has a confusing text intro
2015-12-02T21:32:07 <jhung> Ah thanks. I can fix and clarify that.
2015-12-02T21:32:18 <jhung> Do you get a sense of what the issues are anastasiac?
2015-12-02T21:32:26 <anastasiac> also, jhung, spinners are probably slightly less familiar, even to tech audience, so the \xe2\x80\x9cAnother possible implementation\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d paragraph that introduces the spinner option might benefit from a one-sentence explanation of what a spinner is, how it differs from a slider
2015-12-02T21:32:34 <anastasiac> jhung, so far, yes. still reading
2015-12-02T21:33:37 <anastasiac> jhung, it\xe2\x80\x99s not clear to the reader whether or not the spinner option is expected to address any of the problems with the slider option, or if it shares the problems
2015-12-02T21:33:44 <anastasiac> etc
2015-12-02T21:34:33 * anvk has quit
2015-12-02T21:34:43 <jhung> Ah gotcha anastasiac. I think this page can use a quick introduction which describes the two approaches.
2015-12-02T21:35:34 <anastasiac> jhung, I think any reader with a grasp of what 180\xc2\xb0 means will grasp the problem of the arrow direction contradicting the direction of movement pretty quickly
2015-12-02T21:36:21 <anastasiac> the 75% number seems odd; wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be 50%?
2015-12-02T21:37:26 <anastasiac> jhung, the diagrams are not entirely clear, but the text description of the issue seems adequate
2015-12-02T21:37:28 <jhung> Ah I see anastasiac. It\'s actually the two circles overlapped that gives you 75%.
2015-12-02T21:38:15 <jhung> Great. This gives me an idea of what to tweak.
2015-12-02T21:39:17 <anastasiac> jhung: it\xe2\x80\x99s interesting. the circles look backward to me (though the next person you ask might disagree). I was expecting them to be consistent with clockwise being increasing...
2015-12-02T21:40:06 <jhung> anastasiac: a mathematician would tell you that positive is above the x-axis. :D
2015-12-02T21:40:21 <anastasiac> jhung, if the white area of the circles is meant to represent where there\xe2\x80\x99s a problem, you might want to fill it in with a shade of red. Very colour-centric, I know, but...
2015-12-02T21:40:53 <anastasiac> jhung: yeah, I know, right-hand-rule\xe2\x80\xa6 an engineer would say the same, too.
2015-12-02T21:40:57 <jhung> anastasiac: I was actually thinking of combining the two diagrams since there\'s an area where the issues overlap.
2015-12-02T21:41:17 <jhung> Where up is down, and left is right ...
2015-12-02T21:41:23 <anastasiac> jhung, the combination seems troublesome to me
2015-12-02T21:41:48 <jhung> anastasiac: This whole thing is troublesome. lol
2015-12-02T21:42:11 <anastasiac> since a single pair of arrow keys will work for the entire circle, I would guess that any given user would restrict themselves to only one pair of arrows...
2015-12-02T21:42:41 <jhung> But that\'s a good point about positive and negative and how it depends on your perspective. It may be an issue, but it might not. A question to ask PhET.

2015-12-02T15:50:57 <Justin_o> avtar: when do you think you\'ll have time to talk about using environment variables with vagrant
2015-12-02T15:57:19 <avtar> does 3:00 work for you?
2015-12-02T15:57:24 <avtar> Justin_o: ^
2015-12-02T15:57:42 <Justin_o> avtar: no, sorry, we have the community meeting at that time today
2015-12-02T15:57:49 <avtar> ah right
2015-12-02T15:57:54 <avtar> how about after the meeting?
2015-12-02T15:58:50 <Justin_o> avtar: sure, but i\'ll probably only have about 30 min, is that okay?
2015-12-02T15:59:05 <avtar> yup that should work
2015-12-02T15:59:12 <Justin_o> avtar: okay, sounds good then

2015-12-02T16:25:23 <Justin_o> Bosmon, cindyli: could one of you please review this pull request for the first discovery tool https://github.com/GPII/first-discovery/pull/107
2015-12-02T16:25:36 <Justin_o> it\'s to add the gpii- prefix to the package name
2015-12-02T16:26:17 <Bosmon> Justin_o - do you want to give it a sensible version and node compatibility profile too?
2015-12-02T16:27:18 <Justin_o> Bosmon: what would be a sensible version number? 0.1.0?  or we could do 1.00 i guess
2015-12-02T16:27:39 * jhung1 joined the channel
2015-12-02T16:27:39 <Justin_o> Bosmon: it runs on the client so I have no idea what the node compatibility is
2015-12-02T16:27:45 <Justin_o> runs in the browser that is
2015-12-02T16:27:49 <Justin_o> Bosmon: ^
2015-12-02T16:28:01 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I think a 1.0.0 might be reasonable, yes... given we plan for it to work : P
2015-12-02T16:28:15 <Bosmon> Justin_o - well, you still have the node compatibility implied by your build tools
2015-12-02T16:28:16 <Justin_o> Bosmon: it should, yes :)
2015-12-02T16:28:30 <Justin_o> Bosmon: ah, good point
2015-12-02T16:28:39 <Bosmon> Current grunt claims it will deal with "node": ">=0.8.0"
2015-12-02T16:29:04 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay, i\'ll go with that then
2015-12-02T16:29:22 <Bosmon> Interestingly the current version of grunt is bound to a version of lodash that now gives maintenance warnings
2015-12-02T16:30:51 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i\'ve updated the pull request with your comment
