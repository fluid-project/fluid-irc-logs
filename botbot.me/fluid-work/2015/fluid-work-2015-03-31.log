b'2015-03-31T17:52:22 <Bosmon> Unfortunately we\'ll just have to write this off as "another of those things that can\'t be solved until we have the async ginger world"
2015-03-31T17:52:50 <Bosmon> But I guess the framework should issue a diagnostic if anyone tries to fire any events before "onCreate" of the component has fired, since this is very likely an error

2015-03-31T17:53:42 <michelled> cindyli: based on your comment on this JIRA it sounds like it can be closed - is that correct? http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5024
2015-03-31T17:54:58 <jhung> Justin_o: I was thinking, instead of the Foundation topbar widget, I was thinking we can use Overview Panel.
2015-03-31T17:57:06 <anastasiac> cindyli, I\xe2\x80\x99ve responded to your comments on the back/next button styling pull request
2015-03-31T17:57:07 <cindyli> yes, michelled
2015-03-31T17:57:10 <Justin_o> Bosmon: hmm okay, is there something i could/should change to the component configuration around that
2015-03-31T17:57:25 <Justin_o> jhung: can you remind me what the designs look like
2015-03-31T17:57:37 <Justin_o> are you going to use overview panel for the menu?
2015-03-31T17:57:43 <Justin_o> sorry, table of contents?
2015-03-31T17:58:12 <jhung> Yes when in mobile. So the user would use the button to reveal the ToC.
2015-03-31T17:58:23 <jhung> ^ Justin_o
2015-03-31T17:59:13 <Justin_o> jhung: it would probably cover the full screen though
2015-03-31T17:59:15 <Justin_o> is that okay?
2015-03-31T18:00:10 <Justin_o> anyways, it could probably work, but it would likely require a bunch of configuration changes. You might want to just write a new component or refactor that one into two
2015-03-31T18:00:51 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I\'ve written this up as http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5611
2015-03-31T18:01:12 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, you can\'t possibly write a reference like         messageBase: "{messageLoader}.resources.prefsEditor", and expect it to succeed
2015-03-31T18:01:30 <Bosmon> So you will have to stop doing that : P
2015-03-31T18:01:41 <Bosmon> The framework should really prevent you writing it, but currently it can\'t
2015-03-31T18:02:01 <jhung> Justin_o: covering full screen is actually okay. I think it could work. The bulk of the work will be the CSS I think.
2015-03-31T18:03:27 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay.. i\'ll try to rewrite that... :)
2015-03-31T18:03:36 <Justin_o> jhung: okay

2015-03-31T18:43:10 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I think that the first round of that test could only have appeared to work because you made no use of the messageBase in the test assertions
2015-03-31T18:43:22 <Bosmon> Since if the request genuinely resolved asynchronously, that reference would just resolve to undefined
2015-03-31T18:44:25 <Bosmon> I see that {messageLoader}.resources is only manually assigned in the overall I/O call back as             that.resources = resources;
2015-03-31T18:45:18 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes
2015-03-31T18:45:26 <Justin_o> Bosmon: but this case is slightly different
2015-03-31T18:45:36 <Justin_o> although not in the sense of the resourceLoader
2015-03-31T18:45:54 <Justin_o> but it is for the separatedPanel itself as opposed to any of the adjuster panels
2015-03-31T18:47:39 <Justin_o> Bosmon: it\'s strange so i\'ve moved the messageBase: "{messageLoader}.resources.prefsEditor"  right into the msgResolver subComponent but now the messages aren\'t resolving at all

2015-03-31T11:45:27 <Bosmon> Hi Justin_o
2015-03-31T11:45:43 <Bosmon> It really is the middle of the night now :)
2015-03-31T11:52:27 <Justin_o> haha :)
2015-03-31T11:53:55 <Justin_o> Bosmon: so for this comment https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/589#discussion-diff-27415782
2015-03-31T11:54:47 <Justin_o> i had originally tried to do that but couldn\'t get it to work. I think because i\'m in a fluid.transform call and on the key for messagekey but i need to replace it\'s sibling values

2015-03-31T12:33:41 <Bosmon> Justin_o - ok, I guess in that case it makes more sense to rewrite the logic so that it is working on the component tree one level further out
2015-03-31T12:33:52 <Bosmon> That is, to check at the level of components rather than members of components
2015-03-31T12:35:12 <Bosmon> That is, all these checks for against "key" should be checks against "thing in val"
2015-03-31T12:40:33 <Justin_o> Bosmon: hmm.. okay.. i\'ll give that a shot.

2015-03-31T13:14:13 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yah... that\'s true... actually i\'m always surprised that any of the composite panel code works. it\'ll be great when we can get it all cleaned up. As it is, it\'s not obvious how to maintain.

2015-03-31T13:50:10 <Bosmon> Since at least the inputs and outputs of the process are (or should be) clear
2015-03-31T13:50:35 <Bosmon> Although speaking as the author of the "protocomponent expander" I can say that this argument is not true in general :)

2015-03-31T14:53:52 <anastasiac> though when FF supports the web speech api, it will become a concern
2015-03-31T14:54:27 <Justin_o> anastasiac: it could be that because it doesn\'t support speech synthesis that it\'s getting an error that is causing this behaviour
2015-03-31T14:54:32 <Justin_o> so hopefully things will just work

2015-03-31T16:28:39 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i\'m running into an issue with some of the prefsFramework tests
2015-03-31T16:28:45 <Justin_o> they are using the IoCTesting framework
2015-03-31T16:29:07 <Justin_o> if i run the tests together the second one doesn\'t execute, but if i run the separately they work
2015-03-31T16:29:39 <Justin_o> i think it may have to do with the fact that they both have a listener as to onReady as the first item in the sequence
2015-03-31T16:29:42 <Justin_o> any thoughts
2015-03-31T16:30:35 <Bosmon> Justin_o - onReady, or onTestCaseReady?
2015-03-31T16:30:53 <Bosmon> Sorry, I meant onTestCaseStart...
2015-03-31T16:38:35 <Justin_o> onReady from the prefsEditor
2015-03-31T16:38:47 <Justin_o> the test component is created onTestCaseStart
2015-03-31T16:38:55 <Bosmon> ok

2015-03-31T16:41:50 <Justin_o> everything should be working except for the SeparatedPanelPrefsEditor tests

2015-03-31T16:52:29 <anastasiac> jhung, I have a FLUID-5459 branch that is up-to-date with master and can generate the HTML content as styled in Dana\xe2\x80\x99s branch. Should I just issue a pull request with this branch directly, or should it be incorporated with anything you\xe2\x80\x99re doing?
2015-03-31T16:53:05 <jhung> Issue a pull req anastasiac and I\'ll merge when it\'
2015-03-31T16:53:06 <jhung> s in
2015-03-31T16:53:33 <anastasiac> ok, jhung
2015-03-31T16:58:08 * michelled joined the channel
2015-03-31T16:58:12 <Justin_o> anastasiac: did someone mention that you restyled the buttons already? for the first discovery tool
2015-03-31T16:58:44 <anastasiac> Justin_o, yes, I have a pull request for that; just added a link to the iteration page
2015-03-31T16:59:01 <anastasiac> Justin_o, the next/back buttons
2015-03-31T16:59:08 <Justin_o> anastasiac, danaayotte: should i be following that for styling the close button on the congratulations page?
2015-03-31T17:00:12 <jhung> Bosmon, colinclark, others: For the Infusion documentation site, the design shows the Sidebar ToC collapsing into a menu which is revealed by pressing a top-right "hamburger" button. Foundation ships with Top Bar component which they say is accessible. I took a quick look and it seems okay. Is there any reason why we shouldn\'t use it? http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/topbar.html
2015-03-31T17:00:52 <colinclark> toss me a link to the wireframes, jhun?
2015-03-31T17:00:56 <colinclark> jhung ^
2015-03-31T17:01:45 <jhung> sure colinclark - give me a sec. Wiki is slow for me.
2015-03-31T17:04:34 <jhung> colinclark: http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Branding under "Infusion" -> "Infusion Docs mockup"
2015-03-31T17:06:06 <colinclark> I can\'t fully parse these mockups
2015-03-31T17:06:36 <colinclark> is there a view iwth the menu dropped down
2015-03-31T17:06:59 <jhung> page 3 colinclark.
2015-03-31T17:07:26 <cindyli> anastasiac: i left some comments for your pull request - https://github.com/fluid-project/first-discovery/pull/29
2015-03-31T17:07:26 <jhung> page 2 shows the before, and page 3 shows after the menu button pressed.
2015-03-31T17:07:58 <anastasiac> thanks, cindyli
2015-03-31T17:08:02 <cindyli> np
2015-03-31T17:08:54 * colinclark has quit
2015-03-31T17:09:17 <danaayotte> jhung: it would be responsive, right? it would only show up when the screen is too narrow to show the ToC?
2015-03-31T17:09:35 <jhung> Yes danaayotte.
2015-03-31T17:09:46 <anastasiac> cindyli, your comment regarding the lack of yellow outline in Safari: it\xe2\x80\x99s working for me...
2015-03-31T17:10:19 <cindyli> ok, anastasiac, trying again..
2015-03-31T17:10:34 <jhung> I\'m looking for a mechanism to give use this menu-like functionality for the ToC when in mobile view. Foundation has a widget that does similar, but I want to make sure it\'s appropriate before using it danaayotte.
2015-03-31T17:11:19 <danaayotte> got it jhung
2015-03-31T17:18:45 <danaayotte> Justin_o: sure, let\'s make the close button the same. How about this: https://www.dropbox.com/s/6vy8qf7u50guch4/FD%20congratulations.pdf?dl=0
2015-03-31T17:19:22 <Justin_o> danaayotte: that looks good

2015-03-31T17:21:24 <Justin_o> cindyli: i forgot to mention, I talked to danaayotte yesterday about FLUID-271. The pull request can be reviewed and merged. https://github.com/fluid-project/first-discovery/pull/18
2015-03-31T17:21:39 <Justin_o> if you have time, could you please take a look at it?
2015-03-31T17:22:40 <cindyli> sure, Justin_o
2015-03-31T17:22:48 <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks

2015-03-31T17:26:12 <Bosmon> Justin_o - currently looking like a peculiar framework bug
2015-03-31T17:26:43 <Bosmon> I see the I/O occurring for all of the templates and messages, but for some reason, the "onPrefsEditorMessagesLoaded" event never fires the 2nd time round
2015-03-31T17:26:53 <Bosmon> It doesn\'t look like the IoC testing framework is implicated
2015-03-31T17:27:09 <Justin_o> Bosmon: oh okay.. could it have something do with the fetchResources being cached?
2015-03-31T17:27:35 <Bosmon> I don\'t think so, no
2015-03-31T17:27:41 <Bosmon> The I/O still takes a finite time
2015-03-31T17:28:01 <Bosmon> I see the onResourcesLoaded event firing, but not the injected event which should be identical with it
2015-03-31T17:28:03 <cindyli> Justin_o: can you merge in the master for ur pull request https://github.com/fluid-project/first-discovery/pull/18
2015-03-31T17:30:01 * slim_jim joined the channel
2015-03-31T17:32:05 <Justin_o> sorry.. it\'s probably way out of date
2015-03-31T17:38:20 <Bosmon> Justin_o - ok, yes actually it is looking like the fact the resources are cached really is implicated
2015-03-31T17:38:32 <Bosmon> Despite getting a finite travel time, all the I/O is resolving synchronously
2015-03-31T17:40:49 <Justin_o> Bosmon: is there a way around that? the resourceLoaders set forceCache on the resources
2015-03-31T17:41:21 <Justin_o> but shouldn\'t it still fire the event?
2015-03-31T17:42:49 <Bosmon> Justin_o - it should, yes
2015-03-31T17:42:55 <Bosmon> I still haven\'t uncovered the root cause of the bug
2015-03-31T17:44:11 <Bosmon> But it looks like something to do with the IoC reference         messageBase: "{messageLoader}.resources.prefsEditor", on line 68 of SeparatedPanelPrefsEditor.js
2015-03-31T17:45:55 <Bosmon> Actually I am starting to wonder how this has ever worked :)
2015-03-31T17:46:00 <Bosmon> If indeed this code has been like this for a while
2015-03-31T17:47:32 <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/preferences/js/SeparatedPanelPrefsEditor.js#L68
2015-03-31T17:47:34 <Bosmon> It looks like it hasn\'t
2015-03-31T17:47:40 <Bosmon> So for a start, this code is responsible for the bug
2015-03-31T17:47:48 <Bosmon> But the question is why we observe such particular strange behaviour
2015-03-31T17:48:20 <Bosmon> You can\'t issue an IoC reference into the messageLoader\'s resources because you have no reason to believe that it has constructed at the time the separatedPanel has constructed
2015-03-31T17:48:21 * slim_jim has quit
2015-03-31T17:50:41 <Bosmon> Well, I guess this is the whole bug, actually
2015-03-31T17:50:53 <Bosmon> The reference to messageLoader triggers the construction of the component and the firing of the event
2015-03-31T17:51:14 <Bosmon> But none of the listeners attached to onPrefsEditorMessagesLoaded have yet been added to the event
2015-03-31T17:51:23 <Bosmon> So the event actually does fire, it\'s just that it\'s impossible to observe it
