2015-11-26T20:57:45 <Justin_o> cindyli: I\'ve update the README https://github.com/jobara/first-discovery-server/blob/FLOE-430/README.md#development
2015-11-26T20:57:49 <Justin_o> how does that look now?
2015-11-26T21:01:11 <cindyli> Justin_o: what do you think about moving "configuration" section to be right after the "usage" section? i\'m thinking that\'s the one of the first things that users need to know in order to set up the server
2015-11-26T21:01:29 <Justin_o> cindyli: that\'s a good point
2015-11-26T21:06:38 <Justin_o> cindyli: i\'ve made some changes, what do you think of the README now?
2015-11-26T21:08:26 <cindyli> Justin_o: it looks great

2015-11-26T15:33:19 <Justin_o> Bosmon2: if you have time to look over my First Discovery Server pull requests, we\'re hoping to get them in this week as I\'ll be moving over to PhET work next week
2015-11-26T15:33:41 <Justin_o> and I believe the IBM team will be needing the code next week too
2015-11-26T15:34:59 <Justin_o> clown: I have an a11y question for you regarding  360 "slider"
2015-11-26T15:35:26 <Justin_o> clown: so in this sim, you can spin the arm around 360 degrees https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/john-travoltage/latest/john-travoltage_en.html
2015-11-26T15:35:37 * clown looks
2015-11-26T15:36:03 <clown> Justin_o:  yes\xe2\x80\xa6
2015-11-26T15:36:06 <Justin_o> do you know of any aria or html that could be used to represent such a thing.. i guess it doesn\'t have to actually spin around, but at least convey the notion of the values wrapping back around
2015-11-26T15:36:13 <clown> by grabbing and dragging the arm.
2015-11-26T15:36:28 <Justin_o> clown: yes, we\'ll be adding keyboard support for that later too
2015-11-26T15:36:32 <clown> A spinbutton?
2015-11-26T15:36:38 <clown> that might do it.
2015-11-26T15:36:45 <Justin_o> clown: don\'t those have upper and lower bounds though
2015-11-26T15:36:58 <clown> I\'ve seen spinners for time, which also circles around midnight.
2015-11-26T15:37:02 <jhung> anastasiac: want to sync up about dspace?
2015-11-26T15:37:18 <Justin_o> clown: ah, good point.. do you have an example of that, specifically an accessible one :)
2015-11-26T15:37:24 <anastasiac> sure, jhung
2015-11-26T15:37:32 <clown> Justin_o:  not off hand\xe2\x80\xa6
2015-11-26T15:37:41 <jhung> anastasiac: vidyo?
2015-11-26T15:37:44 <anastasiac> sure
2015-11-26T15:37:55 <clown> I presume you mean actual markup, Justin_o?
2015-11-26T15:38:15 * clown thinks of something, and looks.
2015-11-26T15:38:20 <Justin_o> clown: preferably, but even a best practice would be useful
2015-11-26T15:38:33 <jhung> Hmmm anastasiac I\'m getting an error when connecting. Going to restart my Vidyo.
2015-11-26T15:39:32 <anastasiac> odd. jhung, I get a message \xe2\x80\x9cThe other party has ended the call\xe2\x80\x9d
2015-11-26T15:39:47 <jhung> Are you getting a "Failed to establish connection with the router" error anastasiac?
2015-11-26T15:39:56 <anastasiac> no
2015-11-26T15:40:01 <jhung> odd.
2015-11-26T15:40:14 <anastasiac> maybe try opening up your room, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll connect to that?
2015-11-26T15:40:19 <jhung> ok
2015-11-26T15:40:36 <jhung> same error anastasiac
2015-11-26T15:40:42 <jhung> going to reboot.
2015-11-26T15:40:43 <clown> Justin_o:  I found one, but I\'m wondering if the aria is (1) correct or (2) capable. I vagule remember an issue with "indeterminate" range controls.
2015-11-26T15:40:55 <anastasiac> well, maybe we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to use the old-fashioned skype, jhung
2015-11-26T15:40:59 <clown> Does HTML5 <range> require upper/lower bounds?
2015-11-26T15:41:06 <jhung> sure anastasiac
2015-11-26T15:41:21 <clown> anyhow, dojo has an example of a spinner with no max nor min:  http://archive.dojotoolkit.org/dojo-2015-01-01/dojotoolkit/dijit/tests/form/test_Spinner.html
2015-11-26T15:41:38 <clown> it\'s the 4th one on that test page.
2015-11-26T15:44:45 <Justin_o> clown: trying to look at the spec for range inputs, but this page isn\'t opening for me https://www.w3.org/wiki/HTML/Elements/input/range
2015-11-26T15:45:20 <clown> Justin_o:  I\'m looking at the spec itself  http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/forms.html#range-state-%28type=range%29
2015-11-26T15:45:59 <anastasiac> michelled: do you have a minute to skype with me and jhung?
2015-11-26T15:48:55 <clown> Justin_o:  in terms of aria, the properties of interest are: aria-valuemax, aria-valuemin, aria-valuenow, and aria-valuetext
2015-11-26T15:49:39 <clown> The spec says that for a spinner, if min, max, or now are missing, they get default values.
2015-11-26T15:50:10 <clown> those defaults are based on the HTML5 spec I referenced above.
2015-11-26T15:50:57 <clown> bottom line:  the min, max, and value for both ARIA controls, and HTML5 range are always "definite".  There doesn\'t seem to be a way of specifying "circular".
2015-11-26T15:51:29 <clown> The closest I\'ve found is in the aria role="progressbar".
2015-11-26T15:51:51 <clown> progressbar also supports min, max, now, and text for values.
2015-11-26T15:52:42 <clown> but, it also allows for an indeterminate progressbar \xe2\x80\x94 that\'s represented by making sure the aria-valuenow is not present.
2015-11-26T15:54:56 <Justin_o> clown: i was thinking of an indeterminate progress, but i don\'t think it really captures the interaction
2015-11-26T15:55:51 <clown> Justin_o: right:  a progressbar is not the right widget (it\'s read-only).  I just mentioned it since it seems to be the only one that allows for indeteminacy.
2015-11-26T15:56:04 <clown> with respect to the aria-value* attributes.
2015-11-26T15:56:10 <Justin_o> clown: okay
2015-11-26T15:56:18 <Justin_o> clown: hmm.. any other ideas?
2015-11-26T15:56:34 <Justin_o> i haven\'t been able to think of anything yet, but you\'d think this isn\'t such a novel interaction
2015-11-26T15:57:16 <clown> Right now, I\'m looking through the aria issues to see if anything is in the pipeline \xe2\x80\x94 to allow a range control that is circular, or has indeterminate upper/lower bounds.
2015-11-26T16:04:32 <clown> Justin_o:  I think what you have to do is have a spinner whose min is 0, max is 359, and code it such that wraps.  For example, if the current value is "0" and the spinner is decremented, it goes 359, 358, 357, etc.
2015-11-26T16:04:48 <clown> You might be able to pull it off with a slider, as well.
2015-11-26T16:05:11 <Justin_o> clown: will that be confusing for a user though, i think it should be technically possible, if the input doesn\'t block it
2015-11-26T16:05:31 <Justin_o> or we make the max 360 but convert it to 0
2015-11-26T16:06:34 <clown> the middle value of the slider is where JT is pointng at the door knob.  move the slider left moves the arm clockwise.  the left end of the slide is 180 deg opposite of the doorkknob.
2015-11-26T16:07:47 <clown> move the slider right, and the arm moves counter-clockwise, where the right most end point of the slider is also 180 deg opposite the doorknob.
2015-11-26T16:09:20 <clown> then, use aria-valuetext (maybe) for more desriptive position info:  for example, "arm is point at the doorknob", "arm is pointing up above the doorknob", "arm is pointing straight up", and so on.  Mind you, you need a large number of text descriptions\xe2\x80\xa6
2015-11-26T16:12:35 <jhung> clown: that\'s an interesting idea. We were thinking of using text descriptions every 18 degrees so the user isn\'t bombarded with updates. We\'re also thinking of using sonification to convey the proximity of the hand to the doorknob.
2015-11-26T16:12:53 <jhung> so closer to the middle of the slider you would hear a more intense sound than you would at the edges.
2015-11-26T16:13:41 <clown> jhung:  yes, that reminds me of the audio look and feel  (ah, the good old days).
2015-11-26T16:14:36 <clown> jhung:  do you need all 360 degrees?  Could the demo make do with larger jumps (= fewer positions)?
2015-11-26T16:14:37 <jhung> clown: anastasiac and I were reminiscing about Peptalk the other day\xe2\x80\xa6
2015-11-26T16:15:26 <anastasiac> you guys are making me feel my age...
2015-11-26T16:15:28 <clown> jhung:  from the audio laf days, the sound that worked best for progressbars and sliders was a chromatic scale.
2015-11-26T16:15:57 <jhung> clown: We have an idea to use full 360 degrees but have a modifier which allows to quicker traversal (i.e. hold down shift when arrowing to move more quickly)
2015-11-26T16:16:44 <clown> jhung, that\'s essentially the kind of functionality one gets when using "page-up" "page-down" keys with sliders \xe2\x80\x94 bigger jumps.
2015-11-26T16:17:10 <jhung> clown: Do we still have that somewhere? It\'d be good to base the implementation of sonification in this simulation on something that has been tested and implemented previously.
2015-11-26T16:17:35 <clown> jhung:  a running demo?  no.
2015-11-26T16:17:53 <jhung> clown: page-up / down may actually be a better option - it\'s more logical to me, but not all keyboards have those keys.

2015-11-26T17:08:38 <clown> jhung:  I found the audio for the swing sliders:  http://clown.idrc.ocad.ca/AudioLAF/XlateMatrix/slider.htm
2015-11-26T17:09:33 <jhung> Ah. the unmistakable purple colour scheme of Java Swing. Thanks clown!
2015-11-26T17:09:56 <clown> jhung:  the audio playback doesn\'t work in safari, but does in FF and Chrome.
2015-11-26T17:10:13 <jhung> thanks!
2015-11-26T17:10:15 <clown> might be one of safari preferences, not sure.
2015-11-26T17:10:19 <clown> welcome.
2015-11-26T17:28:43 <anastasiac> alanharnum, cindyli: I\xe2\x80\x99m noticing that the use of Inline Edit in the chart authoring demo doesn\xe2\x80\x99t include the \xe2\x80\x9cundo\xe2\x80\x9d functionality. Is that intentional?
2015-11-26T17:29:13 <cindyli> anastasiac: according to sepideh, it\'s intentional
2015-11-26T17:29:33 <alanharnum> anastasiac, do you mean the reset button, or something else?
2015-11-26T17:29:36 <cindyli> anastasiac: no, i guess i misunderstood u
2015-11-26T17:29:49 <alanharnum> if the inline edit has an inherent undo functionality, it wasn\'t intentionally disabled
2015-11-26T17:29:52 <cindyli> what i meant was the "reset" button won\'t reset those fields
2015-11-26T17:30:36 <anastasiac> alanharnum: it does. try the demo here: http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/inlineEdit/ After you\xe2\x80\x99ve addd text, you\xe2\x80\x99ll see an additional icon that will undo/redo the most recent change
2015-11-26T17:30:50 <anastasiac> cindyli: I\xe2\x80\x99m talking only about the inline edit for the headings
2015-11-26T17:30:53 <cindyli> ok
2015-11-26T17:31:58 <alanharnum> anastasiac: we can do what\'s necessary to enable it, i\'m sure it\'s straightforward
2015-11-26T17:33:02 <anastasiac> it\xe2\x80\x99s not urgent, alanharnum. I\xe2\x80\x99ll file a jira for it so we don\xe2\x80\x99t forget. I was just using the demo for a screenshot of the inline edit component, and I noticed it was missing
2015-11-26T17:35:58 <alanharnum> anastasiac: thanks - jira would be excellent
