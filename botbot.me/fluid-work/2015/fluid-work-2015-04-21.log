b'2015-04-21T16:18:36 <anastasiac> np. I\xe2\x80\x99m on it, colinclark
2015-04-21T16:18:41 <Bosmon> Another option is simply to JIRA the problem and move on
2015-04-21T16:19:02 <colinclark> Bosmon: thanks for recognizing the crunchy deadline
2015-04-21T16:19:04 <anastasiac> colinclark, remind me of the deadline?
2015-04-21T16:19:14 <colinclark> Thursday morning Euro time, anastasiac
2015-04-21T16:19:18 <cindyli> Bosmon: i hope it won\'t take too long. if i cannot get it figured out in a couple of hours, will file a jira for it. what do you think, Bosmon
2015-04-21T16:19:27 <anastasiac> oh, no problem!
2015-04-21T16:19:41 <Bosmon> cindyli - sure - I think we should at least take the time to understand what the problem is precisely
2015-04-21T16:19:51 <cindyli> ok
2015-04-21T16:21:01 <Bosmon> cindyli - can you give me a link to the mockups for this page again?
2015-04-21T16:21:50 <cindyli> Bosmon: the template for the language panel - https://github.com/cindyli/first-discovery/blob/FLOE-281/src/html/lang.html
2015-04-21T16:21:56 <Bosmon> Thanks
2015-04-21T16:22:09 <cindyli> no problem
2015-04-21T16:22:55 <Bosmon> cindyli - so where is the template holding the radio buttons?
2015-04-21T16:23:03 <cindyli> line 6, Bosmon
2015-04-21T16:23:10 <Bosmon> oh yes, sorry
2015-04-21T16:23:11 <Bosmon> I see it now
2015-04-21T16:23:39 <Bosmon> So the issue is that the browser natively binds LEFT, RIGHT, UP and DOWN handlers for navigation through these elements?
2015-04-21T16:27:16 <cindyli> right, that could be the caue, Bosmon
2015-04-21T16:27:19 <cindyli> cause
2015-04-21T16:27:28 <Bosmon> cindyli - but it is true, right?
2015-04-21T16:27:35 <Bosmon> It is the browser handling navigation, and not us?
2015-04-21T16:28:15 <cindyli> yes, Bosmon
2015-04-21T16:28:20 <Bosmon> ok

2015-04-21T17:28:31 <avtar> sepideh, one possible regarding the project overview area.. based on the y-axis i\'m assuming each date shows how long one test run took to complete
2015-04-21T17:30:13 <avtar> but for some projects we will most likely have days where several test runs take place depending on the number of commits
2015-04-21T17:36:03 <colinclark> avtar, Bosmon: I\'m curious to get your thoughts on the newest dashboard mockups
2015-04-21T17:36:19 <colinclark> I like the fact that Sepi is exploring different techniques
2015-04-21T17:36:21 <Bosmon> Hi colinclark
2015-04-21T17:36:34 <colinclark> but I wonder if this graph in the "at a glance view" is quite what you\'d want to see
2015-04-21T17:36:38 <Bosmon> I think that it\'s unnecessary to display the "coverage" in the running bar graph
2015-04-21T17:36:54 <colinclark> I\'m imagining this view should summarize essential information about the stability of a project
2015-04-21T17:37:04 <Bosmon> There seems to be too much information overloaded onto the same bar
2015-04-21T17:37:33 <Bosmon> We can\'t display both coverage and duration at the same time
2015-04-21T17:37:46 <Bosmon> And I suggest rather than either, that we display the number of passing and failing tests
2015-04-21T17:38:13 <colinclark> I\'m trying to think this through...
2015-04-21T17:38:30 <colinclark> You want to see at a glance whether a project has tests
2015-04-21T17:38:34 <colinclark> how extensive those tests are
2015-04-21T17:38:41 <colinclark> if those tests have tended to fail or pass
2015-04-21T17:40:00 <colinclark> and then generally how active the project is
2015-04-21T17:40:13 <colinclark> you may not want to use a project that has one contribute and hasn\'t been commmitted to in a year
2015-04-21T17:40:24 <avtar> yes
2015-04-21T17:40:46 <avtar> maybe something like number of contributors and commits a la http://grafana.org/assets/img/blog/mixed_styles.png
2015-04-21T17:47:32 <cindyli1> Bosmon: regarding the issue of radio button states not being changed with the selectable plugin, i can manually check/uncheck radio button by registering onSelect handler, but the manual change doesn\'t trigger onchange to be fired for that button. as a result, the panel is not re-rendered.
2015-04-21T17:48:06 <Bosmon> cindyli1 - I believe a useful trick in this situation is to also call $.change() on the element
2015-04-21T17:48:20 <cindyli1> trying..
2015-04-21T17:49:13 <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/renderer/js/fluidRenderer.js#L606
2015-04-21T17:49:17 <Bosmon> You can see this trick being used here
2015-04-21T17:50:07 <colinclark> avtar: that\'s a cool idea
2015-04-21T17:50:20 <colinclark> It could even be enough to have something a little simpler, I\'m not sure
2015-04-21T17:50:36 <cindyli1> Bosmon: isn\'t that to register a change event?
2015-04-21T17:51:00 <Bosmon> cindyli1 - oh yes, my mistake :)
2015-04-21T17:51:08 <Bosmon> I\'m sure there is an example elsewhere though...
2015-04-21T17:51:18 <cindyli1> looking too
2015-04-21T17:51:47 <Bosmon> Yes, TextfieldSlider tests
2015-04-21T17:52:38 <cindyli1> right
2015-04-21T17:52:44 <Bosmon> Ah wait
2015-04-21T17:52:46 <Bosmon> I remember this now
2015-04-21T17:54:44 <Bosmon> cindyli1 - this is the reason we wrote this utility: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/core/js/FluidView.js#L311
2015-04-21T17:55:06 <cindyli1> Bosmon: i did this - $(element).attr("checked", "checked").trigger("change");
2015-04-21T17:55:12 <Bosmon> cindyli1 - did it work?
2015-04-21T17:55:21 <cindyli1> that does trigger the change event and re-rendering
2015-04-21T17:55:25 <Bosmon> Awesome
2015-04-21T17:55:45 <cindyli1> but now i can only arrow thru the first two radio buttons, not the rest
2015-04-21T17:55:53 <Bosmon> And I assume the browser properly takes care of mutual exclusion between the buttons etc.
2015-04-21T17:56:07 <Bosmon> I see
2015-04-21T17:56:10 <Bosmon> Perhaps it doesn\'t
2015-04-21T17:56:34 <avtar> danaayotte, colinclark, sepideh: if the project being summarized is web based do you think it\'s worth showing a conformance grade? http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#conformance
2015-04-21T17:57:04 <Bosmon> cindyli1 - perhaps because the selectable plugin is destroyed on rerendering?
2015-04-21T17:57:17 <Bosmon> cindyli1 - perhaps it will indeed be better to abandon the use of the plugin for now
2015-04-21T17:57:29 <Bosmon> Do you think you could write up these experiences in a JIRA?
2015-04-21T17:57:40 <cindyli1> certainly, Bosmon
2015-04-21T17:58:01 <cindyli1> btw, the selectable plugin is re-bound at every afterRender
2015-04-21T17:58:33 <Bosmon> And then refer to the JIRA next to your code for stopArrowBrowseOnEdgeButtons
2015-04-21T17:58:45 <cindyli1> sure
2015-04-21T17:59:30 * sepideh joined the channel
2015-04-21T17:59:31 <Bosmon> cindyli1 - yes, but I imagine that the plugin has possibly become confused about which item actually has the focus on re-rendering.... in any case, we should try to make this work someday
2015-04-21T17:59:36 <Bosmon> We need to reimplement the plugin anyway
2015-04-21T17:59:58 <Bosmon> Thanks, cindyli1
2015-04-21T18:00:01 <cindyli1> ok. right, after re-rending\xe2\x80\xa6
2015-04-21T18:00:11 <cindyli1> my pleasure, Bosmon
2015-04-21T18:03:56 <colinclark> avtar: I guess the issue with conformance is what I was saying to sepideh earlier
2015-04-21T18:04:16 <colinclark> Our ability to truly test accessibility conformance in an automated way
2015-04-21T18:04:30 <colinclark> there are some tools, and we should definitely look at them
2015-04-21T18:04:51 <colinclark> but they really only can evaluate issues related to relatively static plain HTML
2015-04-21T18:05:49 <colinclark> sepideh: did you see the channel logs from our earlier discussion while you were at lunch?
2015-04-21T18:06:13 <sepideh> give me a sec, I\xe2\x80\x99ll check it right now
2015-04-21T18:10:02 <sepideh> Great feedback. Ok so it seems that I have too much going on on the chart.
2015-04-21T18:12:12 <sepideh> colinclark, so on the \xe2\x80\x9cat a glance view\xe2\x80\x99 I can show the number of committers and passed and failed projects. And then if they go to the expanded view, they can see the test coverage and test duration for each build. Do you think that\xe2\x80\x99s reasonable?
2015-04-21T18:12:37 <colinclark> yeah, I think that\'s reasonable
2015-04-21T18:12:46 <colinclark> avtar and Bosmon, what do you think?
2015-04-21T18:13:44 <sepideh> So, I\xe2\x80\x99ll update the chart, but what do you think about that recent activities box? is that useful? or should I just expand the chart instead, or use the box for something else?
2015-04-21T18:15:45 <Bosmon> I think it\'s rasonable
2015-04-21T18:15:47 <Bosmon> reasonable
2015-04-21T18:15:53 <colinclark> I think the recent activity box is probably not needed for the "at a glance" view
2015-04-21T18:16:03 <sepideh> cool
2015-04-21T18:17:00 <colinclark> it should just be a summary of the most important details
2015-04-21T18:20:09 * kasparnet has quit
2015-04-21T18:26:09 <avtar> colinclark: i thought about sepideh\'s mockup from yesterday while reading your list here https://botbot.me/freenode/fluid-work/2015-04-21/?msg=37148781&page=2 and i\'m wondering if that three column layout could summarize everything. so a percentage (ex. 70%) to summarize code coverage which would also indicate whether the project has tests, another graph to provide an average of tests passing and failing, and then an average of commits
2015-04-21T18:26:52 * anastasiac has quit
2015-04-21T18:26:58 <colinclark> what does an "average of commits" convey, specifically, do you think?
2015-04-21T18:27:18 <colinclark> just so I understand
2015-04-21T18:27:51 * sepideh has quit
2015-04-21T18:28:16 * sepideh joined the channel
2015-04-21T18:29:11 * the-t-in-rtf joined the channel
2015-04-21T18:36:43 <avtar> colinclark: an average of commits every month for the last 6 months or so (click to access more data) would reveal how active a project is so you get to see how frequently changes take place without having to see a noisier daily breakdown
2015-04-21T18:36:50 <sepideh> I just had a great conversation with Bosmon, and now i understand what you guys mean by commit and contributers and committers! So, I\xe2\x80\x99ll try another pass at the graph and share with the team. Hope it\xe2\x80\x99s closer to what you are expecting for project overview
2015-04-21T18:38:07 <avtar> sorry, i keep saying average when i mean total

2015-04-21T19:45:15 <Bosmon> cindyli1 - that\'s fine
2015-04-21T19:45:30 <cindyli1> i haven\'t found a good way to replace this private var with something from DOM. can i file a jira for the future improvment
2015-04-21T19:45:31 <Bosmon> Perhaps we can write up a JIRA for making a "reusable scrollTo" component out of this code
2015-04-21T19:45:37 <Bosmon> cindyli1 - certainly, yes
2015-04-21T19:45:43 <cindyli1> sure. will create it

2015-04-21T14:30:54 <jhung> Now that docs are in decent shape, I was wondering if there\'s anything I can help with on PGA?
2015-04-21T14:30:57 <jhung> ^anastasiac
2015-04-21T14:31:51 <anastasiac> that\xe2\x80\x99s a good question, jhung
2015-04-21T14:34:04 <anastasiac> jhung, PGA feels a little bit up in the air, since we\xe2\x80\x99re still planning the June workshop, and we haven\xe2\x80\x99t quite finalized what we want done by then.
2015-04-21T14:34:30 <anastasiac> I wonder if danaayotte, cindyli or Justin_o might have PGA tasks that they could use a hand with, jhung
2015-04-21T14:39:50 <jhung> ok anastasiac. danaayotte, cindyli - let me know if there\'s anything I can help with. If there isn\'t anything immediate, I guess there are the tasks on the post-it note wall I can start looking at.
2015-04-21T14:40:33 <cindyli> thanks, jhung
2015-04-21T14:41:02 <anastasiac> jhung, maybe sepideh has things she might like a hand with?
2015-04-21T14:41:26 <danaayotte> thanks jhung, I can\'t think of anything right now for PGA. I\'m going to send the Crestron panel wireframes to the list soon and would love to hear any feedback you might have
2015-04-21T14:41:45 <jhung> sure danaayotte.
2015-04-21T14:42:37 <sepideh> thanks anastasiac, jhung I may need your feedback for the DSpace dashboard today.
2015-04-21T14:43:26 <jhung> sure sepideh. Let me know when.

2015-04-21T14:57:58 <slim_jim> the-t-in-rtf1: t - by the way should we be saying which AT a term is from in the PTD?
2015-04-21T15:13:46 <the-t-in-rtf1> @slim_jim, the "uses" field is used to keep track of which solutions (AT or mainstream products) use a term as part of their settings.
2015-04-21T15:13:53 <the-t-in-rtf1> or an alias
2015-04-21T15:14:00 <the-t-in-rtf1> or a compound term once I get around to writing those
2015-04-21T15:24:32 <colinclark> hey anastasiac or jhung
2015-04-21T15:24:45 <jhung> hey colinclark
2015-04-21T15:24:57 <colinclark> is the new Infusions docs page set up in such a way that it is correctly linked to from the component overview pages?
2015-04-21T15:25:22 <colinclark> like so if someone is looking at a reorderer demo, and they click the docs icon, they\'ll go to the right part of the docs site?
2015-04-21T15:25:52 <anastasiac> colinclark, the demos on the build site \xe2\x80\x93 the \xe2\x80\x9cAPI\xe2\x80\x9d links in the overview panels \xe2\x80\x93 should be correctly linking to the new documentation
2015-04-21T15:26:03 <colinclark> so good
2015-04-21T15:26:29 <anastasiac> colinclark, let us know if you find anything you\xe2\x80\x99d like us to try to fix/tweak/improve

2015-04-21T15:53:42 <colinclark> Till seems to have chosen the Image Reoderer as the example in his slides, anastasiac
2015-04-21T15:54:10 <anastasiac> it is pretty
2015-04-21T15:54:33 <colinclark> it is
2015-04-21T15:54:36 <colinclark> but it is also a bit awkward
2015-04-21T15:54:43 <colinclark> http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/to-do/ImageReordererAPI.html
2015-04-21T15:54:58 <colinclark> should we suggest a different demo to show?
2015-04-21T15:55:04 <colinclark> or migrate this page?
2015-04-21T15:55:05 <colinclark> or something else?
2015-04-21T15:55:21 <anastasiac> colinclark, the UIO API page is in the new docs
2015-04-21T15:55:33 * kasparnet joined the channel
2015-04-21T15:55:40 <colinclark> it might be better to show a component other than UIO
2015-04-21T15:55:46 <colinclark> for strategic reasons that I can\'t quite put my finger on
2015-04-21T15:55:48 <anastasiac> uploader
2015-04-21T15:55:52 <colinclark> just a gut feel
2015-04-21T15:56:08 <colinclark> the docs look great for Uploader
2015-04-21T15:56:24 <colinclark> though the demo isn\'t very hot
2015-04-21T15:56:25 <anastasiac> the demo is good, too
2015-04-21T15:56:31 <anastasiac> well, it\xe2\x80\x99s not in context
2015-04-21T15:56:40 <anastasiac> but I think it\xe2\x80\x99s good :-)
2015-04-21T15:56:46 <colinclark> I will ask him about his demo
2015-04-21T15:56:59 <colinclark> he actually had a live iFrame embedded in his PPT slides
2015-04-21T15:57:02 <colinclark> which didnt work very well
2015-04-21T15:57:10 <anastasiac> oh, wow
2015-04-21T15:57:19 <colinclark> if he is going to take a screenshot, we could have him add some files to the queue
2015-04-21T15:57:21 <colinclark> so it looks better
2015-04-21T15:57:32 <colinclark> but his idea was to show it live, and then click the API link
2015-04-21T15:58:11 <colinclark> Are there any components that a) look decent on when the demo first loads and b) have documentation available in the new site?
2015-04-21T15:58:31 <anastasiac> unfortunately, we haven\xe2\x80\x99t migrated many component API pages to the new docs yet
2015-04-21T15:58:56 <anastasiac> we have lots of prefs framework tutorial
2015-04-21T15:59:04 <anastasiac> but those probably fall under your \xe2\x80\x98gut feel\xe2\x80\x99
2015-04-21T15:59:56 <anastasiac> we have docs for the Text to Speech component, colinclark, but no demo (other than what\xe2\x80\x99s in the First Discovery Tool)
2015-04-21T16:00:15 <anastasiac> the FD tool doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have any overview panel, either
2015-04-21T16:00:47 <anastasiac> colinclark, if you\xe2\x80\x99d like a particular component API page to be added to the docs, we could probably port one relatively easily
2015-04-21T16:00:59 <colinclark> I can\'t decide
2015-04-21T16:01:11 <colinclark> There\'s a part of me that wants to migrate the image reoderer docs
2015-04-21T16:01:28 <colinclark> since it\'s kind of the sweet spot for a nice, understandable demo
2015-04-21T16:01:33 <colinclark> I guess inline edit is pretty good, too
2015-04-21T16:02:43 <Bosmon> Hi cindyli - saw your comment on the pull request
2015-04-21T16:02:56 <Bosmon> Can you talk a little more about why it seems that the selectable plugin isn\'t working in this context?
2015-04-21T16:04:36 <cindyli> sure, Bosmon. the selectable elements in this case are language radio buttons. using the plugin, the focus change with arrow keys on those radio buttons doesn\'t trigger the radio button focus change
2015-04-21T16:05:11 <cindyli> means doesn\'t trigger the radio button checked, unchecked states
2015-04-21T16:06:26 <Bosmon> cindyli - why does it not trigger the focus change?
2015-04-21T16:08:00 <anastasiac> colinclark, the InlineEdit API docs are a bit incomplete. there are several options for which we don\xe2\x80\x99t actually have any explanation
2015-04-21T16:08:10 <colinclark> ok
2015-04-21T16:08:17 <colinclark> are the Reorderer ones relatively complete?
2015-04-21T16:08:27 <colinclark> is the Image Reorderer our best option if we chose to migrate?
2015-04-21T16:08:39 <anastasiac> I think so, colinclark, but let me double-check
2015-04-21T16:08:42 <colinclark> thanks
2015-04-21T16:09:15 <cindyli> Bosmon: not sure honestly, i suspect it\'s something from the jquery ui that messes up the state change. i suppose selectable plugin is meant to turn unselectable elements to selectable ones
2015-04-21T16:09:17 <anastasiac> at last check, colinclark, the reorderer api pages were technically up to date
2015-04-21T16:10:04 <anastasiac> and they look reasonably complete, colinclark. The image reorderer demo is the most interesting looking, so that might be the best one
2015-04-21T16:10:05 <colinclark> ok
2015-04-21T16:11:30 <cindyli> Bosmon: when arrowing thru these radio buttons, the thing that gets changed is tabindex, from -1 to 0 or vice versa, without any state change
2015-04-21T16:11:36 <colinclark> cindyli: Is it something that could be addressed by changing the focus behaviour of the selectable plugin?
2015-04-21T16:11:46 <colinclark> can you register a handler that will select it on focus?
2015-04-21T16:11:56 <colinclark> anastasiac: I\'m pretty tempted to say let\'s do it
2015-04-21T16:12:26 <colinclark> the migration of the Image Reorderer docs
2015-04-21T16:12:28 <anastasiac> is that a yes, colinclark?
2015-04-21T16:12:29 <colinclark> how much work is it?
2015-04-21T16:12:31 <anastasiac> final answer?
2015-04-21T16:12:35 <colinclark> it\'s an almost-yes :)
2015-04-21T16:12:38 <Bosmon> cindyli - ok, so the issue is that the radio buttons have a native keyboard handler bound already? Is that it?
2015-04-21T16:12:54 <anastasiac> colinclark, it\xe2\x80\x99s just the tediousness of porting it to markdown
2015-04-21T16:12:57 <anastasiac> we can do it
2015-04-21T16:13:25 <cindyli> colinclark: yes, i think it can be solved that way
2015-04-21T16:14:09 <Bosmon> cindyli - I see that there is an "onSelect" option accepted by the plugin
2015-04-21T16:14:10 <cindyli> Bosmon: double checking..
2015-04-21T16:14:45 <Bosmon> So perhaps you can send to this a function which operates on the element to make it selected manually
2015-04-21T16:15:07 <cindyli> yes, Bosmon, i believe we can solve this issue by adding more plugin options. but just wonder if it\'s an overkill
2015-04-21T16:15:19 <cindyli> since a prevent default would do the same work
2015-04-21T16:15:31 <Bosmon> cindyli - well, I see you have custom logic for preventing wrapping
2015-04-21T16:15:42 <Bosmon> Which the plugin already implements
2015-04-21T16:16:00 <cindyli> is it worth to add another layer of plugins and solve issues introduced by this plugin, Bosmon
2015-04-21T16:16:14 <Bosmon> cindyli - the plugin is our plugin, and I think we need to make sure it is usable :)
2015-04-21T16:16:28 <Bosmon> The whole point of developing a framework is to be able to solve standard problems in a standard way....
2015-04-21T16:16:44 <Bosmon> The issue of whether we have time to do this before the demo is separate
2015-04-21T16:16:55 <Bosmon> And if you think it isn\'t a good use of time in the next days, we can definitely punt it
2015-04-21T16:17:37 <Bosmon> But I think we absolutely bear a responsibility to make sure that the selectable plugin directly handles all cases of making ranges of DOM elements accessible through keyboard navigation....
2015-04-21T16:17:53 <Bosmon> Since that is why we built it : P
2015-04-21T16:17:59 <Bosmon> It isn\'t jQuery UI\'s plugin, it is ours
2015-04-21T16:18:14 <colinclark> anastasiac: Let\'s do it
2015-04-21T16:18:14 <cindyli> ok, i see your point and agree. will try to solve those issues
2015-04-21T16:18:19 <colinclark> sorry for the last minute distraction
2015-04-21T16:18:28 <Bosmon> cindyli - well, you don\'t necessarily need to solve them now
2015-04-21T16:18:33 <Bosmon> If we don\'t have time for it
