2015-03-30T13:51:02 <Justin_o> Bosmon: is there a good way to get a message bundle into a component without putting a loader component in front of it
2015-03-30T13:51:24 <Bosmon> Justin_o - not currently, no
2015-03-30T13:51:29 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay.. thanks
2015-03-30T13:51:37 <Bosmon> Because of the current framework architecture, we need to ensure that all I/O for a tree is done at the top level
2015-03-30T13:52:43 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay.. i take it that this will be the case till the asynchronous ginger world comes
2015-03-30T13:53:01 <Bosmon> That\'s right

2015-03-30T16:36:20 <simonjb> thanks anastasiac
2015-03-30T16:36:26 <jhung> thanks
2015-03-30T16:45:26 <anastasiac> jhung, I\xe2\x80\x99m not having any luck finding anything :-( The only thing I found was a screenshot attachment to an email to the list: http://lists.idrc.ocad.ca/pipermail/fluid-work/attachments/20141204/04cf8af0/attachment-0001.png
2015-03-30T16:45:58 <anastasiac> jhung, I guess as danaayotte when she returns
2015-03-30T16:46:39 <jhung> thanks anastasiac.
2015-03-30T16:50:16 <Justin_o> Bosmon: would you be able to review https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/589 I could use some of the modification for the parsing the fetched message in my work for FLOE-294

2015-03-30T18:38:11 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i\'m looking over your comment
2015-03-30T18:38:18 * the-t-in-rtf has quit
2015-03-30T18:38:26 <Justin_o> are you suggesting to modify fluid.fetchResources or to not use it?
2015-03-30T18:38:49 * cindyli has quit
2015-03-30T18:38:53 * the-t-in-rtf joined the channel
2015-03-30T18:39:04 <Bosmon> Justin_o - neither
2015-03-30T18:39:13 <Bosmon> You can add "options" into each record which will be passed through to $.ajax
2015-03-30T18:40:17 <Justin_o> Bosmon: you mean something like resources: {url: "", dataType: "json"}
2015-03-30T18:41:40 <Justin_o> Bosmon: is it safe to assume that all of resources for a particular fetch will use the same dataType?
2015-03-30T18:42:24 <Bosmon> Justin_o - the options need to go into each record separately
2015-03-30T18:42:25 <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/core/js/FluidRequests.js#L27
2015-03-30T18:44:32 <Bosmon> For reference, here is the site at which options merging occurs before they are passed to $.ajax
