b"2015-10-09T23:45:40 <Bosmon> hahaha
2015-10-09T23:45:40 <avtar> have a great weekend!
2015-10-09T23:46:00 * kasparnet has quit
2015-10-09T23:46:39 <Bosmon> Well I've had an uptime of 95 days
2015-10-09T23:46:51 <Bosmon> I think a wreck is unlikely in the next few minutes : P
2015-10-09T23:46:57 <Bosmon> Have a great THANKSGIVVING
"

b'2015-10-09T19:14:33 <simonjb> when working out how pieces of the system fit together
2015-10-09T19:14:59 <Bosmon> The "testDefToCaseHolder" sticks the name of the config grade into "configurationName"
2015-10-09T19:15:24 <Bosmon> And then it is fished out again as a dynamic grade in kettle.test.configuration at https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/blob/master/lib/test/KettleTestUtils.js#L349
2015-10-09T19:19:19 <Bosmon> OK, so this will be relatively straightforward
2015-10-09T19:19:29 <Bosmon> Since your overall "config" grade is actually aligned with the top-level config
2015-10-09T19:19:38 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2015-10-09T19:20:01 <Bosmon> In fact, you can be "super-sneaky" and simply promote the construction of a fake component named "server" which is not actually a server but simply an event aggregator
2015-10-09T19:20:18 <simonjb> Bosmon: thanks for digging
2015-10-09T19:20:30 <Bosmon> Thankfully I was using our "new best practices" in "kettle.test.configuration" and it makes no attempt to actually apply the grade "kettle.server" to the component named server
2015-10-09T19:21:19 <Bosmon> So you can simply supply a fake component that is "fluid.component" (actually "fluid.eventedComponent" since we\'re still dealing with the ancient framework), and have it issue a firing to its "onListen" event only once both the real servers are ready
2015-10-09T19:21:49 <Bosmon> But yes, let\'s get the results from your "manually instantiated assemblage" first to see if we have to deal with any other fallout first
2015-10-09T19:22:04 <simonjb> will do, thanks again

2015-10-09T20:48:28 <simonjb> Bosmon: "Error invoking global function: fluid.component could not be located"
2015-10-09T20:48:35 <simonjb> http://collabedit.com/xbvxc
2015-10-09T20:48:45 <simonjb> config at top
2015-10-09T20:48:51 <simonjb> error trace follows
2015-10-09T20:48:58 <Bosmon> simonjb - yes, sorry
2015-10-09T20:49:06 <Bosmon> YOu may recall that "fluid.component" didn\'t exist in the old framework :)
2015-10-09T20:49:11 <Bosmon> Make it fluid.eventedComponent instead
2015-10-09T20:49:14 <simonjb> ah
2015-10-09T20:51:39 <simonjb> It looks like it might be working!!!
2015-10-09T20:51:44 <simonjb> Bosmon: ^^^
2015-10-09T20:51:44 <Bosmon> simonjb YAY!!
2015-10-09T20:51:52 <Bosmon> One up for.... COMPOSSABLE SOFTWARE : P
2015-10-09T20:51:55 <colinclark> skdjfasl;dkfj, simonjb!
2015-10-09T20:52:09 <colinclark> compostable software?
2015-10-09T20:52:11 <simonjb> I can start kettle and see two servers running
2015-10-09T20:52:23 <Bosmon> superb
2015-10-09T20:52:45 <Bosmon> Yes, composting as we know is the most sustainable practice
2015-10-09T20:53:06 <simonjb> I get an error when I try to login but I think that\'s because I\'m trying to apply settings and am missing a settings handler for gsettings
2015-10-09T20:53:54 <simonjb> I\'m trying to apply Linux settings without Linux specific handlers configured
2015-10-09T20:54:08 <simonjb> but I think the actual kettle servers are running
2015-10-09T20:54:15 <simonjb> thanks Bosmon!!!
2015-10-09T20:54:20 <Bosmon> simonjb - that\'s great
2015-10-09T20:54:27 <Bosmon> We\'re not completely out of the woods yet, but this is very promising
2015-10-09T20:54:36 <Bosmon> And will be something to write up for our memoirs :)
2015-10-09T20:54:37 <simonjb> no, but a good start
2015-10-09T20:57:57 <simonjb> 13th inning!
2015-10-09T20:58:43 <Bosmon> Is this some kind of sports thing? : P
2015-10-09T20:59:15 <simonjb> yeah, Toronto Blue Jays baseball
2015-10-09T20:59:21 <Bosmon> aha
2015-10-09T21:00:24 <simonjb> vs Texas in 2nd game of first round of postseason (Toronto lost the first)
2015-10-09T21:00:49 <simonjb> they drew at 9 innings and are playing extra
2015-10-09T21:01:02 <colinclark> it\'s pretty crazy, Bosmon
2015-10-09T21:01:07 <Bosmon> I guess I was going to guess baseball and not basketball :)
2015-10-09T21:01:17 <colinclark> yes
2015-10-09T21:05:11 <Bosmon> Wow, NOAM CHOMSKY has a young new wife : P
2015-10-09T21:06:34 * clown has quit
2015-10-09T21:08:47 <colinclark> The sports talk must have led you to Chomsky, Bosmon
2015-10-09T21:10:44 * sepidehshahi has left the channel
2015-10-09T21:30:27 <Bosmon> yes, you spotted it :)
2015-10-09T21:51:17 <avtar> Bosmon: ping
2015-10-09T21:51:52 <Bosmon> hey avtar
2015-10-09T21:53:21 <avtar> do you have a few minutes to try some first-discovery-server vagrant changes?
2015-10-09T21:57:55 <colinclark> You might be running up against Friday-night-of-a-long-weekend syndrome, avtar :)
2015-10-09T22:02:16 <avtar> fair enough :)
2015-10-09T22:02:45 <colinclark> do you have plans this weekend?
2015-10-09T22:03:54 <avtar> i\'ll be a bridesmaid tomorrow
2015-10-09T22:04:23 <avtar> otherwise hoping to take it easy for the rest of the weekend
2015-10-09T22:04:25 <avtar> you?
2015-10-09T22:22:14 <colinclark> oh yes
2015-10-09T22:22:17 <colinclark> bridesmaid
2015-10-09T22:22:19 <colinclark> that will be fun
2015-10-09T22:22:29 <colinclark> my plans are also to take it easy
2015-10-09T22:22:36 <colinclark> take the sails off the boat :(
2015-10-09T22:22:56 <colinclark> possibly take a blowtorch and some toxic fluids to the boat\'s old steel cradle
2015-10-09T22:22:56 * kasparnet joined the channel
2015-10-09T22:23:01 <colinclark> write some code
2015-10-09T22:23:03 <colinclark> read some books
2015-10-09T22:24:02 <avtar> blowtorch, toxic fluids, and no boat :/
2015-10-09T22:24:28 <avtar> maybe it\'s time to redirect energy towards ping pong
2015-10-09T22:24:47 <avtar> starting with hanging out with digitalocean next week
2015-10-09T22:26:46 <colinclark> hahaha
2015-10-09T22:26:49 <colinclark> yes, that could be fun
2015-10-09T22:27:06 <avtar> https://youtu.be/vUcAg5uWaEE?t=24m00s
2015-10-09T22:29:02 <avtar> that\'s an interesting point
2015-10-09T22:35:08 <avtar> and no mention of nvda
2015-10-09T22:56:34 <Bosmon> hey avtar
2015-10-09T22:56:39 <Bosmon> So how can I try these changes?
2015-10-09T23:02:38 <avtar> Bosmon: i have some changes in this fork https://github.com/avtar/first-discovery-server/tree/FLOE-423
2015-10-09T23:03:46 <avtar> when you\'re in that branch\'s directory you\'ll need to do: vagrant destroy -f; vagrant box update && vagrant up
2015-10-09T23:04:17 <avtar> vagrant destroy might not be required since it\'s my fork but it won\'t hurt
2015-10-09T23:04:40 <Bosmon> At least it automatically dealt with the port collision this time
2015-10-09T23:04:49 <avtar> :)
2015-10-09T23:04:59 <Bosmon> It is GATHERING FACKTS< apparently
2015-10-09T23:05:09 <avtar> gotta check facts in life
2015-10-09T23:05:23 <Bosmon> Sadly didn\'t work
2015-10-09T23:05:26 <Bosmon> Let me paste the error
2015-10-09T23:05:45 <Bosmon> actually let me update the box first
2015-10-09T23:06:08 <avtar> you\'ll need to do vagrant destroy this time
2015-10-09T23:06:17 <Bosmon> ok
2015-10-09T23:06:17 <avtar> if it attempted to create the vm with an older box
2015-10-09T23:06:31 <Bosmon> It not only attempted, but succeeded : P
2015-10-09T23:06:49 <avtar> http://127.0.0.1:8080/demos/ ?
2015-10-09T23:07:24 <Bosmon> Not as much success as that....
2015-10-09T23:07:48 <Bosmon> Ok, I destroyed and updated it
2015-10-09T23:07:50 <Bosmon> Retrying now
2015-10-09T23:08:00 <avtar> did it tell you the alternative port it used when it detected 8080 was being used by another process?
2015-10-09T23:08:08 <Bosmon> Yes
2015-10-09T23:08:11 <Bosmon> 2200
2015-10-09T23:08:21 <avtar> that might be for ssh
2015-10-09T23:08:54 <avtar> a hunch though
2015-10-09T23:09:00 <Bosmon> FACTS again
2015-10-09T23:10:05 <Bosmon> Quite encouraging now
2015-10-09T23:10:23 <Bosmon> Not only that
2015-10-09T23:10:28 <Bosmon> I have fucking DEMOOES!!!!!!
2015-10-09T23:10:32 <Bosmon> God almighty
2015-10-09T23:10:35 <avtar> yay :D
2015-10-09T23:11:11 <Bosmon> HAPY THANKSGIVUING, AVVATAR :)
2015-10-09T23:11:15 <avtar> are you able to view logs using this url? http://127.0.0.1:19531/entries?_EXE=/usr/bin/node&follow
2015-10-09T23:11:33 <Bosmon> yes
2015-10-09T23:11:35 <Bosmon> I see LOGGES
2015-10-09T23:11:50 <avtar> awesome!
2015-10-09T23:11:52 <avtar> it\'s a thanksgiving miracle
2015-10-09T23:12:34 <Bosmon> Yes
2015-10-09T23:12:38 <Bosmon> Let us thank the Native Peoples
2015-10-09T23:14:12 <avtar> i\'ll update my docs next week then
2015-10-09T23:15:11 <avtar> now confidently covering the holy trifecta of os x, windows, and linux environments
2015-10-09T23:38:53 <avtar> Bosmon: you may need to rebuild the vm one more time :/
2015-10-09T23:39:14 <avtar> \'vagrant provision\' will do that if you don\'t want to destroy it altogether
2015-10-09T23:39:27 <Bosmon> avtar - why would I want to do that when it\'s all working so well :)
2015-10-09T23:40:26 <avtar> i made a nodejs automation related change to work around a virtualbox shared folders issue https://github.com/remy/nodemon/issues/146
2015-10-09T23:40:58 <avtar> it continues to work well after that.. tested on my end

2015-10-09T23:41:38 <colinclark> What, Bosmon?
2015-10-09T23:41:44 <Bosmon> AVVATTAR\'s latest VAGGRANT build works fine!
2015-10-09T23:41:52 <colinclark> YEAH!
2015-10-09T23:42:00 <colinclark> avtar: You rule!
2015-10-09T23:42:06 <colinclark> Did you see some logs with it, Bosmon?
2015-10-09T23:42:13 <Bosmon> Yes!
2015-10-09T23:42:16 <Bosmon> LOGGES!
2015-10-09T23:42:30 <colinclark> I see this is a first very early step towards REDISTRIBUTION OF POWER
2015-10-09T23:42:54 <colinclark> Even if we don\'t develop every day in a Vagrant VM, we at least can test our code in the real environment it is deployed in
2015-10-09T23:42:57 <Bosmon> !!!
2015-10-09T23:43:29 * yzen joined the channel
2015-10-09T23:43:41 <avtar> good times, dudes
2015-10-09T23:43:54 <colinclark> avtar: Redistributing power is where it\'s at
2015-10-09T23:44:40 <avtar> agreed
2015-10-09T23:44:46 <avtar> consistency is also where it\'s at ;)
2015-10-09T23:45:04 <Bosmon> avtar - the "provision" seemed to work fine
2015-10-09T23:45:12 <avtar> noiiice
2015-10-09T23:45:12 * colinclark has quit
2015-10-09T23:45:35 <avtar> Bosmon: i think i\'ll leave now before something happens to your computer

2015-10-09T15:01:31 <colinclark> Bosmon: I can confirm, at least informally, that publishing Infusion does reduce our duplication problems
2015-10-09T15:01:54 <colinclark> but of course it relies on all modules depending on the same version of Infusion
2015-10-09T15:02:07 <colinclark> which given that I extensively dependent on node-jqunit, is no yet the case for me
2015-10-09T15:02:19 <colinclark> but the new dedupe micromodule is working great
2015-10-09T15:03:02 <colinclark> For now, variations on your scripts in universal will presumably proliferate
2015-10-09T15:03:23 <colinclark> such as this one in osc.js, which will make running my tests easier (though a tiny tiny bit slower, perhaps) https://github.com/colinbdclark/osc.js/blob/master/package.json#L43-L46
2015-10-09T15:03:51 <colinclark> I was realizing that we had at some point talked about actually mergingi node-jqunit into Infusion
2015-10-09T15:04:06 <colinclark> back when I was looking at running Infusion\'s unit tests in Node.js
2015-10-09T15:04:17 <Bosmon> Yes
2015-10-09T15:04:36 <Bosmon> I guess in practice we will go in the other direection, and break out the part of Infusion which node-jqUnit relies on
2015-10-09T15:04:56 <Bosmon> The thing that we have called "fluid-store"
2015-10-09T15:04:59 <colinclark> right
2015-10-09T15:05:08 <colinclark> I guess nightly publishing of Infusion will complicate our problems of duplication in the short term
2015-10-09T15:05:17 <colinclark> though cutting more frequent major releases will offset that
2015-10-09T15:05:20 <Bosmon> Yes
2015-10-09T15:05:33 <Bosmon> Well, good to know that the dedupe-infusion work will continue to be somewhat useful
2015-10-09T15:05:48 <Bosmon> Considering how hard it is to write even 50 lines of code and get it right : P
2015-10-09T15:05:51 <colinclark> yep, it\'s certainly better than it was before

2015-10-09T18:14:41 <simonjb> Bosmon: I\'ve started looking at building the config as we discussed and had a question that I was hoping you could help me with regarding parsing kettle configs
2015-10-09T18:15:07 <simonjb> Bosmon: I see kettle.config.createDefaults as the function that reads configs
2015-10-09T18:15:40 <simonjb> Bosmon: but there isn\'t an exposed function for getting the grade definition as an object
2015-10-09T18:16:04 <simonjb> the grade definition is built and then used in a call to fluid.defaults
2015-10-09T18:16:06 <simonjb> https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/blob/master/lib/configLoader.js#L79
2015-10-09T18:16:32 <simonjb> kettle.config.createDefaults returns the typeName
2015-10-09T18:16:59 <simonjb> can I get the grade definition from infusion if I have the type name?
2015-10-09T18:17:52 * the-t-in-rtf has quit
2015-10-09T18:18:13 <simonjb> if not, I can refactor createDefaultsImpl and extract a function for retrieving grade definitions
2015-10-09T18:18:46 <Bosmon> simonjb - yes, you can read the definition if you have the typeName
2015-10-09T18:18:50 <Bosmon> YOu just need to call fluid.defaults()
2015-10-09T18:19:04 <Bosmon> type name, sorry : P
2015-10-09T18:19:16 <Bosmon> I am trying to abolish the strange string "typeName" from Infusion ....
2015-10-09T18:23:55 <simonjb> Bosmon: aha! I didn\'t know that
2015-10-09T18:29:38 * slim_ has quit
2015-10-09T18:34:15 <simonjb> Bosmon: here\'s the config built for cloudBasedFlowManager.json
2015-10-09T18:34:17 <simonjb> https://gist.github.com/simonbates/eb13c9ab6301d7c43dd6
2015-10-09T18:35:03 <simonjb> there are a number of distributeOptions that target the server and the flowManager
2015-10-09T18:35:12 <Bosmon> I see
2015-10-09T18:35:38 <Bosmon> :(
2015-10-09T18:36:12 <simonjb> I was hoping you\'d be like: "oh yeah, you just do this"
2015-10-09T18:36:19 <simonjb> not :(
2015-10-09T18:36:21 <simonjb> :(
2015-10-09T18:36:22 <Bosmon> Well, sure
2015-10-09T18:36:26 <Bosmon> Let me think a sec : P
2015-10-09T18:36:29 <simonjb> :)
2015-10-09T18:36:57 <simonjb> thanks very much for your help
2015-10-09T18:37:24 <Bosmon> Yes well, this, in theory is fine
2015-10-09T18:37:32 <Bosmon> In theory we can just do something even simpler than we were planning
2015-10-09T18:37:47 <Bosmon> And simply embed these two configs entirely unchanged as siblings in a larger "mega-config"
2015-10-09T18:38:46 <simonjb> ok, this sounds promising but I don\'t know that it means :) do we have an example?
2015-10-09T18:38:54 <Bosmon> simonjb - no, it\'s never been done before : P
2015-10-09T18:39:05 <Bosmon> But really, a "config" is not really anything other than a section of component tree
2015-10-09T18:39:05 <simonjb> ah
2015-10-09T18:39:40 <simonjb> sure...
2015-10-09T18:39:45 <Bosmon> So, I think this will work, but I forsee a further problem which just relates to the testing infastructure itself - the issue is that we have additional asynchrony involved, in that we must not start the test fixtures until BOTH servers have started up
2015-10-09T18:39:50 <Bosmon> But let\'s cross that bridge when we come to it
2015-10-09T18:40:02 <Bosmon> Try making the mega-config and fire it up, and see what happens : P
2015-10-09T18:40:50 <Bosmon> Ah of course you still have the issue of fixing the port numbers
2015-10-09T18:41:08 <Bosmon> So the two configs will need at least SOME modification before they are assembled together
2015-10-09T18:41:51 <simonjb> I\'m not sure what we mean by mega-config -- can you sketch what it looks like?
2015-10-09T18:41:57 <Bosmon> But it looks like there is no milage in renaming the "server" element since once the servers become distant siblings there\'s no possibility of them colliding anyway
2015-10-09T18:42:55 <Bosmon> Sure
2015-10-09T18:43:00 <Bosmon> Wow, stypi.com is gone!
2015-10-09T18:43:13 <Bosmon> That was quick
2015-10-09T18:43:29 <Bosmon> It\'s not even showing up in Google hits so I guess it is permanently gone
2015-10-09T18:44:31 <Bosmon> Ok we now have "collabedit"
2015-10-09T18:44:32 <Bosmon> http://collabedit.com/u6cfa
2015-10-09T19:06:35 <Bosmon> simonjb - ok, so looking ahead, the problematic part of the testing framework is here: https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/blob/master/lib/test/KettleTestUtils.js#L348
2015-10-09T19:09:10 <simonjb> yes, I see
2015-10-09T19:10:30 <Bosmon> So you\'re going to have to stuff another entry in "gradeNames" of the testDefs that knocks this "type" out of its place in the definition at https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/blob/master/lib/test/KettleTestUtils.js#L385
2015-10-09T19:11:36 * alanharnum joined the channel
2015-10-09T19:11:42 <Bosmon> And replaces it with a different piece of "glue" that instead waits to fire the "onServerReady" event only once both servers are ready
2015-10-09T19:12:37 <simonjb> ok, that makes sense
2015-10-09T19:13:00 <simonjb> thanks Bosmon
2015-10-09T19:13:07 <Bosmon> Of course it would help a lot to have some VISUAL TOOLS that could help us visualise this containment structure :)
2015-10-09T19:13:17 <Bosmon> I\'m having to struggle to piece together how it all fits together again
2015-10-09T19:13:57 <simonjb> yes, some tooling would help a lot
2015-10-09T19:14:14 <simonjb> I find myself doing lots of text searches
2015-10-09T19:14:33 <Bosmon> Ah yes, I see how this works now
