2015-05-20T15:57:02 <anastasiac> cindyli, my FLOE-343 pull request is updated
2015-05-20T15:57:35 <cindyli> thanks, anastasiac, having a look..

2015-05-20T16:27:57 <jhernandez> clown: I\'m leaving in 20 mins or so
2015-05-20T16:28:14 <clown> jhernandez: okay.
2015-05-20T16:28:30 <clown> I have nothing pressing at the moment.
2015-05-20T16:28:39 <jhernandez> meanwhile, which test is failing?
2015-05-20T16:30:39 <jhernandez> everything that is xrandr-related is passing here

2015-05-20T16:37:11 <clown> sorry, jhernandez, I was distracted.  Let me look
2015-05-20T16:39:50 <clown> jhernandez:  First one:  FAIL: Module "GPII Xrandr Module" Test name "Running tests for Xrandr Bridge" - Message: Checking that \'setScreenSize\' is callable
2015-05-20T16:40:11 <clown> Second one:  FAIL: Module "GPII Xrandr Module" Test name "Running tests for Xrandr Bridge" - Message: Checking that \'setScreenSize\' sets the resolution
2015-05-20T16:40:31 <clown> I guess the second failure is implied by the first.
2015-05-20T16:41:19 <clown> Also, I played with the xrandr command line utility to try to change the screen resolution that way.  That fails as well.
2015-05-20T16:42:44 <clown> Finally, I tried changing the resolution through the "Displays" control panel, and discovered that there is no resolution available other than the one the screen is current set to.
2015-05-20T16:42:53 <jhernandez> oh
2015-05-20T16:43:27 <jhernandez> ok
2015-05-20T16:43:28 <clown> But, I can change the resolution by changing the size of the VM\'s window.
2015-05-20T16:46:30 <clown> btw, jhernandez, after the second failure \xe2\x80\x94 the test of setScreenSize \xe2\x80\x94 node appears to have hung.  That\'s also strange.
2015-05-20T16:46:51 * clown should try running the tests in debug mode.
2015-05-20T16:48:19 <jhernandez> yes, it is
2015-05-20T16:50:22 <clown> "yes, it is"  \xe2\x80\x94 what is "it", jhernandez?
2015-05-20T16:50:39 <jhernandez> xD
2015-05-20T16:50:41 <jhernandez> "node appears to have hung.  That\'s also strange"
2015-05-20T16:50:49 <clown> oh, right.  :-)
2015-05-20T16:51:32 <jhernandez> perhaps we need to add some kind of verification before performing the calls
2015-05-20T16:51:33 <jhernandez> dunno
2015-05-20T16:51:49 * sepideh joined the channel
2015-05-20T16:51:57 <jhernandez> I would need to reproduce the issue
2015-05-20T16:52:08 * anastasiac joined the channel
2015-05-20T16:52:24 <jhernandez> and then look when and why it gets hung
2015-05-20T16:53:43 <clown> I\'ll keep looking too.  It hangs on line 49:  xrandr.setScreenResolution(resolution.width, resolution.height);
2015-05-20T16:54:22 <jhernandez> looks like both you and Bosmon are experiencing a similar issue -> https://github.com/GPII/linux/blob/master/tests/UnitTests.sh#L33
2015-05-20T16:54:50 <clown> But, they didn\'t crash before I did all the updates.
2015-05-20T16:54:55 <jhernandez> mmm
2015-05-20T16:54:58 <clown> They actuall worked.
2015-05-20T16:55:02 <jhernandez> that\'s strange
2015-05-20T16:55:04 <clown> *actually
2015-05-20T16:56:31 <jhernandez> I assume that, when you updated it, you built the native components again, isn\'t it?
2015-05-20T16:57:00 <clown> yes, or rather, I did "grunt build".
2015-05-20T16:57:05 <jhernandez> ok ok
2015-05-20T16:57:34 <clown> hmmm\xe2\x80\xa6 was I supposed to deleate something from universal
2015-05-20T16:57:43 <clown> I remember doing that in the past.
2015-05-20T16:57:46 <clown> *delete
2015-05-20T16:58:03 <jhernandez> I don\'t know
2015-05-20T16:58:45 <jhernandez> in any case, if the problem is only with xrandr, the problem is there
2015-05-20T16:58:49 <jhernandez> nothing to do with universal
2015-05-20T16:59:54 <clown> Just to be sure, I just did both \'grunt clean\' followed by \'grunt build\' and then ran the xrandr tests again.  Same failures.
2015-05-20T17:00:17 <clown> aha.  right you are.  "nothing to do with universal".
2015-05-20T17:00:54 <clown> jhernandez:  I have to go to another telecon.  I will continue looking around, if you like.
2015-05-20T17:01:30 <clown> have a nice evening!
2015-05-20T17:01:30 <jhernandez> whatever you want
2015-05-20T17:01:45 <clown> well, I want a million dollars  ;-)
2015-05-20T17:02:02 <jhernandez> I\'m not sure how critical is a problem in a vm for us
2015-05-20T17:02:19 <jhernandez> ie, I have some problems that are vm-related with windows too
2015-05-20T17:04:16 * clown is now known as clown_mtg
2015-05-20T17:05:10 <jhernandez> so if you want and you have time for, it would be nice to find the root of the problem and get it fixed (or at least, workaround it)
2015-05-20T17:08:03 <clown_mtg> okay jhernandez

2015-05-20T17:47:11 <Justin_o> Bosmon: do you have a thought on this http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLOE-346
2015-05-20T17:47:46 <Justin_o> it seems that the code is in place https://github.com/fluid-project/first-discovery/blob/master/src/js/panels.js#L108-L114
2015-05-20T17:47:50 <anastasiac> danaayotte, would you say the language in the FD tool wireframes is finalized? ready for translation?
2015-05-20T17:48:59 <Justin_o> Bosmon: however, the value returned from that.model.value is not exact it\'s 0.20000000000000004 instead of 0.2
2015-05-20T17:50:13 <Bosmon> Justin_o - if you\'re confident that the value can\'t become less than the minimum, I suggest you compare it using the fluid.model.isSameValue utility
2015-05-20T17:50:40 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i believe there is a model relay to prevent it from going out of range
2015-05-20T17:50:45 <Bosmon> Justin_o - cool
2015-05-20T17:50:58 <Justin_o> Bosmon: https://github.com/fluid-project/first-discovery/blob/master/src/js/panels.js#L34-L42
2015-05-20T18:02:52 <Justin_o> cindyli: could you please review my pull request for FLOE-346 https://github.com/fluid-project/first-discovery/pull/53
2015-05-20T18:03:11 <cindyli> ok, Justin_o
2015-05-20T18:03:33 <Justin_o> tahnks
2015-05-20T18:03:34 <Justin_o> thanks
2015-05-20T18:04:17 <cindyli> Justin_o: can you also take the chance to fix what danaayotte and anstasia talked in the design channel? to rename "controls" to "buttons"
2015-05-20T18:04:29 <Justin_o> cindyli: I did :)
2015-05-20T18:04:40 <cindyli> great. thanks, Justin_o

2015-05-20T13:39:42 <anastasiac> good morning, Justin_o. Regarding your comments on the high-contrast themes pull request...
2015-05-20T13:40:14 <anastasiac> I\xe2\x80\x99ve tried everything I can to stop the \xe2\x80\x98flashing\xe2\x80\x99 on hover; it\xe2\x80\x99s not about transparency. I\xe2\x80\x99ve made everything and the kitchen sink transparent, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not helping
2015-05-20T13:40:47 <anastasiac> also, I left a comment on the pull request about the disabled +/- buttons. I don\xe2\x80\x99t have those in my branch; they\xe2\x80\x99re not in master yet, are they?
2015-05-20T13:41:37 <Justin_o> anastasiac: the +/- were for the text size, which is in master
2015-05-20T13:42:31 <anastasiac> ah! when it\xe2\x80\x99s maxed out\xe2\x80\xa6 right. It still has hover styles in the regular theme, too\xe2\x80\xa6 ok, I\xe2\x80\x99ll look into that
2015-05-20T13:42:40 <Justin_o> anastasiac: cool, thanks
2015-05-20T13:42:42 <anastasiac> but I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what to do about the flashing.
2015-05-20T13:42:56 <Justin_o> can we screen share for a couple minutes
2015-05-20T13:43:05 <anastasiac> Justin_o, by flashing, you mean the fact that a smaller rectangle seems to take a different amount of time to change colour, right?
2015-05-20T13:43:07 <anastasiac> yes
2015-05-20T13:43:12 <Justin_o> yes
2015-05-20T13:43:40 <anastasiac> hang on, give me two minutes
2015-05-20T13:43:45 <anastasiac> can I ping you?

2015-05-20T14:00:48 <anastasiac> Justin_o, cindyli: I\xe2\x80\x99ve issued a pull request for something danaayotte noticed yesterday \xe2\x80\x93\xc2\xa0that the prefs are not in the right order: https://github.com/fluid-project/first-discovery/pull/50
2015-05-20T14:01:02 <anastasiac> I added it to the iteration page, in the first table
2015-05-20T14:01:23 <Justin_o> anastasiac: thanks, did you make sure all the tests are still passing
2015-05-20T14:01:40 <Justin_o> the testUtils has a map of their order
2015-05-20T14:02:20 <anastasiac> oy, thanks for the reminder to check. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t know that was coded into the tests
2015-05-20T14:02:53 <anastasiac> actually, yes, I did, since I did that
2015-05-20T14:04:08 <Bosmon> fluid-everyone - together with the-t-in-rtf, we learned something useful about git today
2015-05-20T14:04:37 <Bosmon> In that I discovered that, when trying to preview what the result of merging in a pull request will be, simply running "git diff master" will not be a correct summary of the changes
2015-05-20T14:04:50 <Bosmon> In the case that the branch state that the pull request was issued against is older than that of current master
2015-05-20T14:05:16 <Bosmon> This, I think, also explains why github pull request diffs often appear to be "stale" - they don\'t move along with the state of the current master as it evolves
2015-05-20T14:06:21 <Bosmon> In this case, I seemed to see the opposite - the pull request seemingly showed "too few" changes - because it only represented a small change with respect to its original parent
2015-05-20T14:06:38 <Bosmon> So, the commands to be used locally to reproduce this effect are explained on this stackexchange: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5817579/how-can-i-preview-a-merge-in-git
2015-05-20T14:07:02 <Bosmon> In particular one should use the bizarre syntax involving ".." or "..." in order to correctly see what the effect of merging a pull request will be
2015-05-20T14:07:50 <Bosmon> Since a plain "git diff" will just show you ALL the differences, whether these result from the pull request state being "new" or its original target being "old"
2015-05-20T14:07:57 <the-t-in-rtf> I ended up testing my changes by adding an "upstream" remote, checkout out upstream/master, and then running a command like `git diff \xe2\x80\xa6branch-name`.
2015-05-20T14:08:03 <the-t-in-rtf> checking
2015-05-20T14:09:31 <Justin_o> Bosmon: this is an issue when master is out of date?
2015-05-20T14:09:37 * clown joined the channel
2015-05-20T14:10:13 <Bosmon> Justin_o - it\'s not master being out of date, but the original state of the repo from which the branch (pull request)
2015-05-20T14:10:25 <Bosmon> I had updated my local repository fully with both master, and the pull request branch
2015-05-20T14:10:31 <Bosmon> But git diff still showed a huge diff
2015-05-20T14:11:05 <Bosmon> The issue was in fact that the pull request\'s version of "master" was out of date, rather than mine
2015-05-20T14:11:56 <Bosmon> I mean, it is "sort of obvious" but there were lots of aspects of the situation that made it confusing : P
2015-05-20T14:12:27 <Bosmon> Especially since for my "touchstone" of what the merge was doing, I was looking at a package.json file where I had the wrong expectation about which was the older and newer version
2015-05-20T14:13:02 <Bosmon> I *thought* what I was doing was merging in a tiny pull request that just changed two words in a README file
2015-05-20T14:13:12 <Bosmon> But when I ran "git diff master" I saw a huge list of changes, and paniced
2015-05-20T14:13:13 <anastasiac> Justin_o, test-utils updated

2015-05-20T14:17:14 <Justin_o> Bosmon: ah i see..
2015-05-20T14:18:02 <Justin_o> Bosmon: my typical approach for this type of thing is to create a test branch example test-FLUID-XXXX that is created off an updated master.. then i merge the pull request branch into that
2015-05-20T14:18:26 <Justin_o> which should allow diffs with master to be up-to-date and i can make sure that things work as expected when it gets into master
2015-05-20T14:21:19 <Bosmon> Justin_o - cool

2015-05-20T14:50:08 <michelled> ^

2015-05-20T15:09:36 <Justin_o> cindyli: could you please review my pull request for FLOE-335
2015-05-20T15:09:37 <Justin_o> https://github.com/fluid-project/first-discovery/pull/52
2015-05-20T15:09:52 <cindyli> sure, Justin_o
2015-05-20T15:09:56 <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks
2015-05-20T15:10:00 <cindyli> np
2015-05-20T15:19:42 <cindyli> Justin_o: in terms of this priority - https://github.com/jobara/first-discovery/blob/FLOE-335/src/js/panels.js#L672, is there a reason to use the specific -2 rather than -1 or something else?
2015-05-20T15:19:55 <cindyli> just curious
2015-05-20T15:20:07 <Justin_o> cindyli: so something could go in between the two listeners if needed
2015-05-20T15:20:37 <cindyli> ah, very considerate :)
2015-05-20T15:20:48 <Justin_o> :)
