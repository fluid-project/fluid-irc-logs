2015-05-26T17:47:33 <anastasiac> cindyli, Justin_o, simonjb: Would you have some time to chat this afternoon about the FD tool architecture?
2015-05-26T17:48:02 <cindyli> sure, anastasiac
2015-05-26T17:48:11 <simonjb> yep
2015-05-26T17:48:34 <anastasiac> is there any time that\xe2\x80\x99s better or worse? I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to interrupt if you\xe2\x80\x99re in the middle of something
2015-05-26T17:49:50 <Justin_o> anastasiac: i\'m free as long as it\'s not late
2015-05-26T17:50:21 <anastasiac> would now work, cindyli, Justin_o, simonjb?
2015-05-26T17:50:26 <Justin_o> anastasiac: sure
2015-05-26T17:50:31 <simonjb> good for me
2015-05-26T17:50:33 <cindyli> fine with me
2015-05-26T17:50:35 <anastasiac> I\xe2\x80\x99ll open my vidyo room
2015-05-26T17:53:13 <Justin_o> Bosmon: if i have a component that is created via a createOnEvent
2015-05-26T17:53:24 <Justin_o> if that event is fired multiple times, should it be recreated
2015-05-26T17:54:19 <Justin_o> and what happens to the previous one
2015-05-26T18:01:12 <Bosmon> Justin_o - the previous one will be destroyed, and then a fresh one will be created
2015-05-26T18:02:40 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay, that\'s what I though, but i\'m getting an error.. but i just saw that it might be triggered by something else.. i\'ll get back to you if it\'s still an issue
2015-05-26T18:04:15 * sepideh joined the channel
2015-05-26T18:06:59 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay, never mind.. the issue i was seeing was actually related to the tooltip being called when it didn\'t exist... which would then lead the issue i was seeing with the creation.

2015-05-26T18:45:47 <anastasiac> I\xe2\x80\x99m just doing that now, Justin_o
2015-05-26T18:45:56 <anastasiac> double-checking all the other values, as well

2015-05-26T18:53:10 <Justin_o> anastasiac: great thanks.. i think i found the problem, the preferenceMap in the panel was wrong :(
2015-05-26T18:54:05 <anastasiac> oh good! It\xe2\x80\x99s always nice when a bug gets fixed before the JIRA is even written :-)
2015-05-26T18:54:20 <Justin_o> anastasiac: :) i still have to test it out though

2015-05-26T19:06:17 <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks
2015-05-26T19:06:30 <Justin_o> Bosmon: there\'s another task with your name on it on the http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Floe+Iteration+Plan
2015-05-26T19:06:47 <Justin_o> which is to add the text for the step count, are you looking at this?
2015-05-26T19:08:39 * gtirloni has quit
2015-05-26T19:10:05 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I never heard of this task :)
2015-05-26T19:10:24 <Justin_o> Bosmon: ah i wonder who put your name on there

2015-05-26T19:30:48 <cindyli> anastasiac, michelled, Justin_o, we don\'t have many tasks left on the iteration page for the June workshop. what\'s left are: 1. the styling issue that michelled was hoping for Jon to fix; 2. add the text for the step count, with Bosmon\'s name on it. If Bosmon is not working on it yet, i can pick up that one but would need more information of what\'s it about. That\'s all left on the iteration. Another thing that\'s off the list but coming up fr
2015-05-26T19:30:55 * sepideh joined the channel
2015-05-26T19:31:41 <michelled> cindyli: that\'s awesome!
2015-05-26T19:31:53 <Justin_o> cindyli:  your message got cut off
2015-05-26T19:32:03 <cindyli> from where
2015-05-26T19:32:03 <Justin_o> cindyli: also  can you review my pull request for FLOE-340 https://github.com/fluid-project/first-discovery/pull/66
2015-05-26T19:32:14 <cindyli> ok, Justin_o. how can you work so fast??!!
2015-05-26T19:32:26 <Justin_o> cindyli: it cut off at "That\'s all left on the iteration. Another thing that\'s off the list but coming up fr"
2015-05-26T19:32:45 <cindyli> thanks, Justin_o. re-pasting
2015-05-26T19:32:53 <cindyli> anastasiac, michelled, Justin_o, Another thing that\'s off the list but coming up from our earlier conversation with anastasiac is, we could potentially move all markup for the FD on the index.html into a template and fetch it so index.html will be shorter and cleaner. Which one do you think I should work on first?
2015-05-26T19:33:35 <Justin_o> Bosmon: are you going to work on the step thing, or would you like cindyli or I to pick that up?
2015-05-26T19:33:36 <anastasiac> I think the text for the step count is important - or at least SOME way of indicating that there are more icons than what you see
2015-05-26T19:33:42 <anastasiac> it\xe2\x80\x99s very misleading right now
2015-05-26T19:34:09 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I\'d need to know more about what the task was in order to pick it up
2015-05-26T19:34:13 <anastasiac> cindyli, michelled, Justin_o: we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be chatting tomorrow about the workshop, and about what we\xe2\x80\x99d like to show
2015-05-26T19:34:27 <anastasiac> it\xe2\x80\x99s possible things will come up in that conversation that will require development time
2015-05-26T19:34:41 <anastasiac> that said, another possibility is the confirmation screen
2015-05-26T19:34:57 <anastasiac> but that would require some design time, since we now have many preferences :-)
2015-05-26T19:34:58 <michelled> I think before the confirmation screen we should address our technical debt
2015-05-26T19:35:10 <Justin_o> cindyli, Bosmon: if you look in the wireframes.. at the bottom of the first discovery tool under the icons is text that indicates what step you are on
2015-05-26T19:35:16 <michelled> and I agree that we might change directions after the meeting tomorrow
2015-05-26T19:35:28 <Justin_o> michelled: we\'ve knocked off a few of those now too
2015-05-26T19:35:38 <michelled> nice :)
2015-05-26T19:35:39 <anastasiac> michelled, re tech. debt before new screen: I agree

2015-05-26T19:36:05 <cindyli> yes, Justin_o and Bosmon, i see where the text is
2015-05-26T19:36:16 <anastasiac> I\xe2\x80\x99d love to see FLOE-337 adresd
2015-05-26T19:36:27 <anastasiac> it seems rather broken now
2015-05-26T19:36:33 <michelled> also cindyli, I see that you have a couple in progress tasks that we paused you on
2015-05-26T19:36:55 <michelled> if you wanted to make some progress of that, now would be a good time
2015-05-26T19:37:00 <cindyli> michelled: that section was marked "NOT priority for workshop"

2015-05-26T20:13:53 <cindyli> will do, Bosmon
2015-05-26T20:14:17 <cindyli> i\'m also not very confident with my css skills ;)
2015-05-26T20:16:04 <Bosmon> cindyli - at least you can come up with the idea for the comma operator :)

2015-05-26T12:37:42 <anastasiac> Justin_o, about the FD speech rate adjuster: Can I suggest that we change the range somehow? Right now, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take much at all to speed it up so much that it stops talking entirely, even though the \xe2\x80\x9cindicator\xe2\x80\x9d is still down at what looks like a quarter \xe2\x80\x9cfull\xe2\x80\x9d
2015-05-26T12:38:04 <anastasiac> should I file a JIRA for this?
2015-05-26T12:38:10 <anastasiac> it seems like something we should fix before the workshop
2015-05-26T12:38:21 <anastasiac> it appears broken because it stops talking altogether
2015-05-26T12:38:36 <Justin_o> anastasiac: currently the range is the full range that the spec provides
2015-05-26T12:38:46 <Justin_o> but we could limit this to whatever seems reasonable
2015-05-26T12:39:00 <anastasiac> Justin_o, when you tested, did you not notice that it stops talking?
2015-05-26T12:39:14 <Justin_o> anastasiac: i left a note about it on the pull request
2015-05-26T12:39:18 <Justin_o> it only seems to happen in chrome
2015-05-26T12:39:26 <anastasiac> ok, I\xe2\x80\x99ll file a JIRA for this
2015-05-26T12:39:30 <anastasiac> thanks, Justin_o
2015-05-26T12:40:40 <Justin_o> anastasiac: thanks.. it\'s probably more of an issue with the synthesizer, since it should be able to support that range... however it may make sense to limit the range anyways, like we do for text size and other things

2015-05-26T13:41:40 <cindyli> Justin_o: sure, i\'m also thinking to work on issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLOE-340 which is also in the keyboard panel. let\'s chat
2015-05-26T13:41:56 <Justin_o> cindyli: sure

2015-05-26T13:53:25 <Bosmon> Hi there cindyli - my FLOE-344 branch is ready for another round of review
2015-05-26T13:54:06 <Bosmon> cindyli, simonjb - I moved over to the "scrollLeft" strategy as we agreed, although this did create a bit of fallout in that I needed a new "spacer" element at the end of the icons to ensure that they were fully scrollable to the left as required by danaayotte \'s designs
2015-05-26T13:54:42 <Bosmon> Also the icons now dynamically measure themselves, which is a touch annoying, but still I think an improvement on the designer having to add the icon width as a component option

2015-05-26T14:15:52 <Bosmon> re as in "regarding", or "in the matter of" : P
2015-05-26T14:16:07 <Bosmon> So, I\'m not sure I can take the authority on myself to do this : P
2015-05-26T14:16:17 <Bosmon> Since it amounts to a decision about how CSS names are used
2015-05-26T14:16:33 <Bosmon> I see in the file that there is a dedicated class name for each nav icon
2015-05-26T14:16:56 <Bosmon> Also - the issue that redundancy in CSS can\'t usually be eliminated without some form of preprocessor, since it doesn\'t permit any form of "indirect reference" between definitions
2015-05-26T14:17:03 <cindyli> Bosmon: sorry, didn\'t make myself clear, what i meant was, we can do things like
2015-05-26T14:17:14 <cindyli> .gpii-fd-navIcon-welcome .gpii-fd-navIcon-congratulations {...}
2015-05-26T14:17:42 <cindyli> rather than individually
2015-05-26T14:18:00 <Bosmon> cindyli - I don\'t believe we can
2015-05-26T14:18:15 <cindyli> missing comma
2015-05-26T14:18:16 <Bosmon> As far as I\'m aware, the meaning of that definition would then refer to a "congratulations" nested in a "welcome"
2015-05-26T14:18:17 <Bosmon> ah
2015-05-26T14:22:10 <Bosmon> Thanks, cindyli - now done
2015-05-26T14:22:23 <cindyli> cool. thanks
2015-05-26T14:40:34 <Justin_o> cindyli: could you review my pull request for FLOE-339 https://github.com/fluid-project/first-discovery/pull/62
2015-05-26T14:40:43 <cindyli> sure, Justin_o
2015-05-26T14:41:09 <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks
2015-05-26T14:41:17 <cindyli> np
2015-05-26T14:58:14 <Bosmon> cindyli - the icon bar is now centred
2015-05-26T14:59:44 <cindyli> thanks, Bosmon

2015-05-26T15:29:50 <Bosmon> Unfortunately I don\'t have the ability to test on Safari
2015-05-26T15:30:04 <Bosmon> perhaps we should just merge in and then pass this issue over to someone with CSS expertise?
2015-05-26T15:30:31 <cindyli> sounds good, Bosmon. i will merge and create another jira
2015-05-26T15:30:51 <Bosmon> Thanks, cindyli
