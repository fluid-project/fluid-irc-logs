2015-11-10T19:45:59 <cindyli> Justin_o: can you review my pull request for the first discovery tool - https://github.com/GPII/first-discovery/pull/106
2015-11-10T19:46:43 <cindyli> anastasiac: i sent a pull request for updating docs for the code change in the pull request above - https://github.com/acheetham/docs-first-discovery/pull/2, can you take a look?
2015-11-10T19:47:43 <colinclark> hey jhung and gtirloni: What should we do about preserving URLs?
2015-11-10T19:47:47 <colinclark> I was just googling...
2015-11-10T19:48:06 <colinclark> https://www.google.ca/search?q=inclusive+learning+design+handbook
2015-11-10T19:48:12 <colinclark> And I get all these helpful links to the Handbook
2015-11-10T19:48:22 <colinclark> but all of them now give me 404s
2015-11-10T19:49:13 * alanharnum has quit
2015-11-10T19:51:50 <jhung> colinclark: alan was asking about it earlier.
2015-11-10T19:52:00 <colinclark> oh, ok
2015-11-10T19:52:17 <colinclark> Did I miss that? I thought you might have mentioned that we don\'t need redirects
2015-11-10T19:52:22 <jhung> I\'ll put it on the to-do
2015-11-10T19:52:25 * alanharnum joined the channel
2015-11-10T19:52:48 <jhung> We\'ve done redirects in docpad before. We\'ll do the same here colinclark.
2015-11-10T19:54:29 <Justin_o> Bosmon: hi, wondering if you have some thoughts. I was exploring running an instance of the security server along side the first discovery tool server for my tests. simonjb was showing me some of the machinery that is used in universal for things like this. However, we realized that the version of infusion used by the first discovery server and universal is
2015-11-10T19:54:29 <Justin_o> different.
2015-11-10T19:55:32 <Bosmon> anastasiac - thanks for the comments
2015-11-10T19:55:48 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, that\'s true - it will take me a few more days to finish my conversion of universal
2015-11-10T19:55:58 <Bosmon> Unfortunately I haven\'t yet reached the authz server yet
2015-11-10T19:56:08 <colinclark> jhung: Thanks
2015-11-10T19:56:20 <Bosmon> Perhaps you can write your tests against a simple mock server in the meantime
2015-11-10T19:56:34 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay, when you say a few more days do you mean some time this week it might get in?
2015-11-10T19:56:43 <colinclark> Let\'s try to aim to get redirects in place before we launch a new site, in that wonderful Tim Berners-Lee style
2015-11-10T19:56:47 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I will have it working this week, but it will take some time for review

2015-11-10T20:42:44 <colinclark> alanharnum: I don\'t think I\'ll get to do something like this in time for our open ed demo, but this is a reasonable synthesis algorithm for electric pianos like the Rhodes: http://www.keithwhor.com/music/
2015-11-10T20:42:53 <colinclark> which is the sound that danayo\'s sound designs are based on
2015-11-10T20:43:12 <colinclark> It\'s basically a sinewave with an envelope, modulated by some noise to give it a bit of life
2015-11-10T20:43:41 <alanharnum> colinclark: thanks, having a look
2015-11-10T20:44:00 <alanharnum> colinclark: I keep on meaning to hack around on this stuff outside of work but haven\'t found the time
2015-11-10T20:44:07 <alanharnum> maybe a "plane to Vancouver" project :P
2015-11-10T20:44:10 <colinclark> :)
2015-11-10T20:44:20 <colinclark> From a code perspective, this is really a flawed example
2015-11-10T20:44:40 <colinclark> but it is, relative to other DSP strategies, simple
2015-11-10T20:45:00 <alanharnum> I vote for "EDM, bro!" as our sonification approach
2015-11-10T20:45:01 <colinclark> I think could probably be done entirely with three or four unit generators

2015-11-10T21:01:49 <colinclark> alanharnum: I guess the key is that it isn\'t modulating noise into the base sine wave, but rather other sine waves that are somewhat out of phase with the fundamental
2015-11-10T21:02:34 * alanharnum emanates a whooshing sound as whatever colinclark has said goes over his head. :)
2015-11-10T21:02:57 <colinclark> Three differen sine waves, but where the little wibbles and wobbles don\'t line up

2015-11-10T13:24:58 <Justin_o> Bosmon: I have a question about promises
2015-11-10T13:25:02 <Justin_o> fluid.promises
2015-11-10T13:25:57 <Bosmon> Hi Justin_o
2015-11-10T13:26:26 <Justin_o> Bosmon: hello
2015-11-10T13:26:56 <Justin_o> Bosmon: the situation i have is that I have one promise, that when it resolves, calls another promise
2015-11-10T13:27:04 <Justin_o> is there an ideal way to chain these together
2015-11-10T13:27:56 <Justin_o> this has to do with the OAuth2 flow used to store the preferences. I first have to get the authorization token, then i can store the preferences
2015-11-10T13:30:19 <Bosmon> Justin_o - there is the utility fluid.promise.follow
2015-11-10T13:30:48 <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/pull/77/files#diff-10a5c8a3489af2a6b149141f1e60eb27R120
2015-11-10T13:31:00 <Bosmon> Although I\'m not quite clear what you mean by "calls another promise"
2015-11-10T13:31:03 <Bosmon> This may do what you require
2015-11-10T13:33:39 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i need to have access to the results of the first promise to use in the next call
2015-11-10T13:34:03 <Justin_o> Bosmon: basically the resolution of one dataSource set call, needs to call another dataSource set method
2015-11-10T13:34:36 <Justin_o> i get the access token from the first call, which is needed to authenticate the second one
2015-11-10T13:37:17 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I don\'t see that you need to do anything special
2015-11-10T13:37:35 <Bosmon> The call to the 2nd dataSource will be attached in the "then" block of the first promise
2015-11-10T13:38:45 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay, that\'s what i\'m doing.. just wanted to know if there was a better way. thanks

2015-11-10T15:38:39 <anastasiac> hi, Bosmon (Bosmon7?), do you think you might have a little bit of time to look at the FD Tool docs pull request again? I updated my branch based on your feedback. https://github.com/GPII/docs-first-discovery/pull/1

2015-11-10T15:40:17 <Justin_o> Bosmon: datasources return a promise right?
2015-11-10T15:40:42 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i\'m making a call to set and returning it in my function, but the result is an object it seems
2015-11-10T15:43:03 <Justin_o> Bosmon: never mind, i forgot to put the .then

2015-11-10T16:10:17 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf, Bosmon: I have a question regarding tests for the first discovery server. I want to test a POST request to my server. However, it intern makes two requests to the security server, which is an external service. Have you encountered a situation like this, and if so, what approach did you take to resolve it?
2015-11-10T16:11:34 <the-t-in-rtf> I have, and I have used a requestAware and/or contentAware router to take care of it.
2015-11-10T16:12:21 <the-t-in-rtf> I had my handleRequest method kick off a single dataSource\'s read and then listened for the result.
2015-11-10T16:12:41 <the-t-in-rtf> Do you need to chain the requests, or run them in parallel?
2015-11-10T16:12:44 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: i have the implementation working, but want to write a test against it
2015-11-10T16:12:54 <the-t-in-rtf> AHHHH
2015-11-10T16:13:00 <Justin_o> and the requests are chained
2015-11-10T16:13:04 <the-t-in-rtf> Yes, I have very definitely tested stuff like that.
2015-11-10T16:13:33 <the-t-in-rtf> For the external services I depend on, I wrote whole packages to faithfully represent them
2015-11-10T16:13:39 <the-t-in-rtf> for example gpii-pouchdb-lucene
2015-11-10T16:13:42 <the-t-in-rtf> and gpii-pouchdb
2015-11-10T16:14:23 <the-t-in-rtf> I have also seen people use things like nock.js, where you mock the expected response and can have it intercept network calls even.
2015-11-10T16:15:05 <jhung> anastasiac: I updated the pull req.
2015-11-10T16:15:08 <the-t-in-rtf> Given that we are not responsible for maintaining the external services, a mock sound sreasonable
2015-11-10T16:15:11 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: so gpii-pouchdb-lucene are kind of like mock instances
2015-11-10T16:15:18 <the-t-in-rtf> Well, they act almost the same
2015-11-10T16:15:30 <the-t-in-rtf> pouchdb is a workalike
2015-11-10T16:15:37 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: we sort of are maintaining the external service, it\'s also part of GPII
2015-11-10T16:15:41 <the-t-in-rtf> and pouchdb-lucene just indexes a pouch instance instead of couch.
2015-11-10T16:15:59 <the-t-in-rtf> If you are maintaining the external instance, you should definitely be testing against it if you can.
2015-11-10T16:16:28 <the-t-in-rtf> It makes for kind of large test harnesses, but it\'s the way to go.
2015-11-10T16:16:31 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: yes, true, not sure how to accomplish that though
2015-11-10T16:16:38 <the-t-in-rtf> I have test harnesses that launch pouch, express, lucene, and a mail server
2015-11-10T16:16:47 <the-t-in-rtf> Let me send you some links
2015-11-10T16:16:51 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: thanks
2015-11-10T16:17:29 <the-t-in-rtf> I will send you one that launches three services as an example
2015-11-10T16:17:46 <the-t-in-rtf> The lucene stuff is extra crazy in that you have to manage shutting down a java process.
2015-11-10T16:17:56 <Justin_o> :(
2015-11-10T16:18:21 <the-t-in-rtf> Oh, there are ways.
2015-11-10T16:18:36 <the-t-in-rtf> The pouch and express stuff plays nicely, no worries.
2015-11-10T16:18:39 <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/the-t-in-rtf/gpii-pouchdb/blob/master/tests/js/reload-tests.js
2015-11-10T16:18:46 <the-t-in-rtf> OK, there are some tests with the world\'s simplest payload
2015-11-10T16:19:00 <the-t-in-rtf> as I am testing reloading the harness over and over again
2015-11-10T16:19:16 <the-t-in-rtf> And here\'s the harness:  https://github.com/the-t-in-rtf/gpii-pouchdb/blob/master/tests/js/harness.js
2015-11-10T16:19:50 <the-t-in-rtf> The main thing to note is how its events are wired up to the parent so that you can have a step in your sequence that waits for startup.
2015-11-10T16:20:48 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: thanks, i\'ll take a look at those
2015-11-10T16:20:54 <the-t-in-rtf> There is a grade that is meant to work with a harness that eventually fires an onStarted event:  https://github.com/the-t-in-rtf/gpii-express/blob/GPII-1499/tests/js/lib/test-helpers.js#L85
2015-11-10T16:21:19 <the-t-in-rtf> If you pick up the latest commit in that branch you can use express = require("gpii-express"); express.loadTestingSupport();
2015-11-10T16:21:34 <the-t-in-rtf> Rather than hunting for the test fixture in your node_modules directory.
2015-11-10T16:21:52 <the-t-in-rtf> The latest branch also supports adding stuff at the end, hopefully you won\'t need that.
2015-11-10T16:22:08 <the-t-in-rtf> (adding steps at the end of each test\'s sequence array)
2015-11-10T16:22:41 <the-t-in-rtf> Let me know how it goes, I have about a thousand hours of coaching from @bosmon that I need to pay forward.
2015-11-10T16:22:49 <the-t-in-rtf> happy to pair or just keep trading links\xe2\x80\xa6. :)
2015-11-10T16:23:52 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, just to be clear, that grade is a drop-in caseholder that takes care of part of the wiring you\'ll need.  The rest is in the harness example (the event wiring)
