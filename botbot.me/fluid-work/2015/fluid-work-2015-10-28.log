b'2015-10-28T18:02:42 <clown> I attemtped to resubscribe this morning and nothing happened.
2015-10-28T18:02:58 <colinclark> ok
2015-10-28T18:03:02 <colinclark> thank you
2015-10-28T18:03:15 <clown> no problem, colinclark.  Thank you for looking into it.
2015-10-28T18:04:14 <clown> I should have known that something was amiss, but nothing shows up in the inbox, it just didn\'t click that something was wrong.
2015-10-28T18:05:35 <clown> btw, I can\'t see anything obvious in my mail filters.  The one I have for the gpii arch list simply moves it from my inbox to a GPII sub-folder.
2015-10-28T18:07:22 <gtirloni> clown: the list emails are being rejected, that\'s why you don\'t receive anything
2015-10-28T18:07:28 <gtirloni> to=<clown@alum.mit.edu>, relay=alum-mailsec-scanner-8.mit.edu[18.7.68.20]:25, delay=8845, delays=8844/0.02/1.1/0, dsn=4.7.1, status=deferred (host alum-mailsec-scanner-8.mit.edu[18.7.68.20] refused to talk to me: 554 5.7.1 Delivery not authorized)
2015-10-28T18:07:52 <clown> gtirloni:  so, MIT is rejecting them?
2015-10-28T18:08:21 <clown> gtirloni:  let me double check something.
2015-10-28T18:08:44 <gtirloni> clown: yes. we\'ve got a known problem with our reverse DNS that we\'re trying to fix with the ISP but i\'m sure not that\'s why they are rejecting it (nothing in their reject msg)
2015-10-28T18:08:51 <slim_> When I run node windows it logs it\'s loading the 2 ontology files twice. Is that expected?
2015-10-28T18:10:54 <clown> gtirloni:  just checked my whitelist at alum-mailsec, and "architecture@lists.gpii.net" and "lists.gpii.net" are both in there.

2015-10-28T18:13:43 <slim_> when will I learn to keep quiet? ;)_
2015-10-28T18:14:02 <gtirloni> clown: it\'s probably something lower level, like the reverse dns (we\'re not listed in any RBL -- http://www.anti-abuse.org/multi-rbl-check-results/?host=205.211.169.31). we\'ll follow up with our ISP about this and keep you posted okay? unless MIT\'s IT can give a better explanation of why they are rejecting our emails, I\'d say reverse DNS is likely the culprit

2015-10-28T18:15:01 <clown> gtirloni:  re:  "keep you posted okay?"  Sure. no problem.  I\'ll do what I can from MIT\'s side in the meantime.

2015-10-28T17:08:11 <slim_> Kasper - that\'s why it doesn\'t work - iot\'s confused what floor it\'s on
2015-10-28T17:16:59 <Justin_o> Bosmon: do the kettle datasources handle query parameters
2015-10-28T17:17:21 <Bosmon> Justin_o - anything can go into the URL path
2015-10-28T17:18:00 <Justin_o> Bosmon: basically i\'d like to forward on the query parameters from a call to the first discovery server to the security server
2015-10-28T17:18:44 <Justin_o> Bosmon: so two things, 1) don\'t know what parameters i\'ll be getting, if any 2) i receive them as an object and would like if possible to pass them along as an object
2015-10-28T17:19:41 <Justin_o> as it is now it would seem i\'d need to specify a token in the url like "http://localhost/?%query" and then construct the query parameter from the object myself
2015-10-28T17:20:28 <kasparnet> avtar: should I run the tests from within the box or from outside it?
2015-10-28T17:20:42 <avtar> kasparnet: outside
2015-10-28T17:20:46 <avtar> from os x
2015-10-28T17:23:05 <kasparnet> and how do I do that? I forgot - do you have the commands handy?
2015-10-28T17:23:59 <avtar> kasparnet: grunt unit-tests && grunt acceptance-tests
2015-10-28T17:24:08 <avtar> or \'grunt tests\' to run both
2015-10-28T17:24:29 <kasparnet> oh, I see -- so no crazy ssh-commands, that\'s all gruntified?
2015-10-28T17:24:31 <kasparnet> coolio
2015-10-28T17:25:05 <Bosmon> Justin_o ?
2015-10-28T17:25:16 <Justin_o> Bosmon: which part?
2015-10-28T17:25:16 <Bosmon> It will take the query parameter from the termMap and hence the directModel, just like everything else
2015-10-28T17:25:33 <Bosmon> I\'m not sure what you mean by "construct the query parameter from the object myself"
2015-10-28T17:25:33 <Justin_o> Bosmon: but what if there is nothing
2015-10-28T17:25:52 <Bosmon> Justin_o - what do you mean by what if there is nothing?
2015-10-28T17:25:56 <Justin_o> i get the query parameters from the first discovery tool as an object via gpii-express
2015-10-28T17:26:03 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2015-10-28T17:26:05 <Justin_o> but i need to forward these on to the security server
2015-10-28T17:26:15 <Bosmon> Yes
2015-10-28T17:26:16 <kasparnet> avtar:
2015-10-28T17:26:19 <kasparnet> grunt unit-tests
2015-10-28T17:26:19 <kasparnet> Warning: Task "unit-tests" not found. Use --force to continue.
2015-10-28T17:26:23 <Bosmon> You will just stick these in the directModel?
2015-10-28T17:26:34 <Justin_o> Bosmon: there may or may not be any query parameters sent from the original request from the first discovery server
2015-10-28T17:26:37 <Justin_o> sorry
2015-10-28T17:26:39 <Justin_o> from the browser
2015-10-28T17:27:07 <Justin_o> Bosmon: but if i do this  "http://localhost/?%query"
2015-10-28T17:27:16 <Bosmon> Justin_o - Ok, i see
2015-10-28T17:27:21 <avtar> kasparnet: oops
2015-10-28T17:27:22 <avtar> one sec
2015-10-28T17:27:23 <Bosmon> Why might there not be any query parameters?
2015-10-28T17:27:34 <Justin_o> Bosmon: they\'re optional
2015-10-28T17:27:47 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes - what are they, out of interest?
2015-10-28T17:27:57 <Justin_o> they are the ones referring to the "view" in the preferences server.
2015-10-28T17:28:02 <Justin_o> for now that\'s the only one we are expecting
2015-10-28T17:28:34 <Justin_o> this is to support ontologies, although i don\'t fully grasp how those work
2015-10-28T17:29:18 <Bosmon> Justin_o - ok, I see
2015-10-28T17:29:35 <Bosmon> What I suggest for now is you do something like "http://localhost/?view=%view"
2015-10-28T17:29:44 <Bosmon> And then explicitly default the value to ""
2015-10-28T17:30:36 <kasparnet> avtar: should i npm install?
2015-10-28T17:30:57 <avtar> kasparnet: no, my mistake
2015-10-28T17:31:08 <Justin_o> Bosmon:  so the full issue is that the url template is actually http://localhost/%resource right now
2015-10-28T17:31:11 <avtar> you\'ll need to fetch a change from my branch in a sec
2015-10-28T17:31:47 <Justin_o> Bosmon: where resource will be either the /access_token or /add-prefernces end point in the security server
2015-10-28T17:31:57 <Bosmon> Justin_o - seems fine to me
2015-10-28T17:31:57 <Justin_o> the view is really only needed by one of these
2015-10-28T17:32:17 <kasparnet> kk
2015-10-28T17:32:34 <Justin_o> so http://localhost/access_token and http://localhost/add-preferences?view=%view
2015-10-28T17:32:47 <Bosmon> Justin_o - that seems like two different dataSources to me
2015-10-28T17:32:53 <Justin_o> really :(
2015-10-28T17:33:03 <Justin_o> i was hoping to avoid adding another one
2015-10-28T17:33:09 <Bosmon> Well, what do they have in common, other than that they are URLs? : P
2015-10-28T17:33:16 <Justin_o> they are part of the same workflow as we have to do the two trips to authenticate
2015-10-28T17:33:34 <Justin_o> Bosmon: https://wiki.gpii.net/w/GPII_OAuth_2_Guide#Client_Credentials_Grant
2015-10-28T17:33:42 <Bosmon> Yes
2015-10-28T17:33:49 <Justin_o> so first to get the access_token the second to save with that access_token
2015-10-28T17:33:51 <Bosmon> They, to me, designate quite different resources
2015-10-28T17:34:02 <Justin_o> and the base part of the urls is the same, so i was hoping to reuse things
2015-10-28T17:34:07 <Bosmon> Even if they are used as part of the same conversation
2015-10-28T17:34:15 <colinclark> Bosmon: So generally the idea is that one has 1 DataSource per REST resource, is that right?
2015-10-28T17:34:26 <Bosmon> colinclark - I would say so, yes
2015-10-28T17:34:36 <colinclark> That seems reasonable to me, I think
2015-10-28T17:34:47 <Justin_o> Bosmon: that does add some distinction though between using them with an object in memory
2015-10-28T17:34:59 <Bosmon> Or one could say "1 DataSource per addressing system" - where an "addressing system" is a regular way of supplying coordinates to resources
2015-10-28T17:35:00 <Justin_o> which you could/would use for the entire object
2015-10-28T17:35:21 <Bosmon> Justin_o - what would be the "object in memory" in this case?
2015-10-28T17:35:21 <colinclark> Bosmon: I think I understand what that means
2015-10-28T17:35:32 <Justin_o> i guess that later definition is more inline
2015-10-28T17:35:44 <Bosmon> Justin_o - if those had been function calls, for example, they would have been different function calls
2015-10-28T17:36:09 * lliskovoi joined the channel
2015-10-28T17:36:11 <Bosmon> YOu wouldn\'t have written a single function called "gpii.oauth.getThing" which accepted different arguments whether it was "access_token" or "add_preferences"
2015-10-28T17:36:28 <Justin_o> it would have accepted a path
2015-10-28T17:36:32 <Justin_o> on the same object
2015-10-28T17:36:47 <Justin_o> which is what i assumed the directModel was trying to facilitate in a way
2015-10-28T17:36:55 <avtar> kasparnet: could you please grab changes from my GPII-1258 branch?
2015-10-28T17:37:05 <Bosmon> Justin_o - what would that object be, that had both "access_token" and "add_preferences" as two paths on it?
2015-10-28T17:37:08 <Bosmon> What would you call such an object
2015-10-28T17:37:26 <kasparnet> avtar -- what\'s your github nick?
2015-10-28T17:37:33 <kasparnet> "avtar"?
2015-10-28T17:37:34 <avtar> kasparnet: avtar
2015-10-28T17:37:39 <kasparnet> hehe awesome
2015-10-28T17:38:02 <Justin_o> Bosmon: {access_token: "", preferences: ""} :) although that\'s a bit contrived
2015-10-28T17:38:24 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i\'m thinking of this in the way that fluid.set and fluid.get work
2015-10-28T17:38:29 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I think it is :)
2015-10-28T17:38:39 <Bosmon> Justin_o - well, not everything in the world is really "part of a giant model"......
2015-10-28T17:38:39 <kasparnet> avtar: do I need to rerun anything
2015-10-28T17:38:45 <kasparnet> or just go with the grunt commands?

2015-10-28T17:40:43 <avtar> kasparnet: something is different with your vagrant environment...
2015-10-28T17:41:16 <Bosmon> This is why our settings handlers have both "get" and "set" methods : P
2015-10-28T17:41:27 <avtar> for now though you can try this: export VAGRANT_DEFAULT_PROVIDER=virtualbox
2015-10-28T17:41:34 <avtar> kasparnet: ^
2015-10-28T17:41:51 <kasparnet> same error avtar
2015-10-28T17:46:51 <avtar> kasparnet: for now could you try this command instead?
2015-10-28T17:47:48 <kasparnet> avtar: which command?
2015-10-28T17:47:49 <kasparnet> TELL ME
2015-10-28T17:47:54 <avtar> vagrant --provider=virtualbox ssh -c \'DISPLAY=:0 node /home/vagrant/sync/tests/AcceptanceTests.js\'
2015-10-28T17:48:18 <kasparnet> Kaspers-MacBook-Air-2:linux kasper$ vagrant --provider=virtualbox ssh -c \'DISPLAY=:0 node /home/vagrant/sync/tests/AcceptanceTests.js\'

2015-10-28T17:48:25 <kasparnet> let me just try restart the terminal
2015-10-28T17:49:19 <avtar> i know on windows the vagrant installer requested that the computer be restarted
2015-10-28T17:51:52 <avtar> kasparnet: it might have to do with how your setup was wonky earlier
2015-10-28T17:52:33 <avtar> to be safe it might be best to start fresh
2015-10-28T17:53:34 <avtar> if you could try \'vagrant destroy -f\' and \'rm -rf .vagrant\'
2015-10-28T17:54:06 <avtar> if the destroy command gives you the same provider error then unfortunately you\'ll need to fire up the virtualbox gui and delete the vm that way
2015-10-28T17:54:31 <avtar> then remove the .vagrant directory
2015-10-28T17:55:32 <avtar> based on what was discussed here https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/issues/5189#issuecomment-74072717
2015-10-28T17:56:16 <kasparnet> avtar: ok - will just restart my machine
2015-10-28T17:56:21 <avtar> kasparnet:
2015-10-28T17:56:25 <avtar> try those steps first
2015-10-28T17:56:33 <avtar> you probably don\'t need to restart
2015-10-28T17:56:40 <kasparnet> ok
2015-10-28T17:57:28 <avtar> the typo earlier probably just created this invalid directory that\'s lingering around .vagrant/machines/<machine_name>/VirtualBox
2015-10-28T17:58:36 <colinclark> clown: So you were subscribed to the architecture list before, right? You don\'t need to type the address in here, but do you remember if you were subscribed with your MIT address or your OCAD address previously?
2015-10-28T18:01:13 <clown> colinclark, I was subscribed previously with my MIT address.
2015-10-28T18:01:23 <colinclark> fascinating
2015-10-28T18:01:35 <colinclark> Any record of your membership has evaporated
2015-10-28T18:01:36 <clown> everything worked fine until about the end of Sep.
2015-10-28T18:01:41 <colinclark> ok
2015-10-28T18:01:54 <colinclark> And you\'ve attempted to resubscribe, and nothing happens, is that correct?

b'2015-10-28T15:12:31 <kasparnet> this command on. A final option is to change to a directory with a
2015-10-28T15:12:33 <kasparnet> Vagrantfile and to try again.
2015-10-28T15:12:37 <kasparnet> avtar: ^
2015-10-28T15:12:39 <kasparnet> should I do what it tells me
2015-10-28T15:12:43 <kasparnet> (i.e. vagrant init)
2015-10-28T15:13:14 <avtar> kasparnet: hmm, did you grab the GPII-1258 branch?
2015-10-28T15:13:16 <kasparnet> oh sorry
2015-10-28T15:13:46 <kasparnet> No usable default provider could be found for your system.
2015-10-28T15:13:46 <kasparnet> Vagrant relies on interactions with 3rd party systems, known as
2015-10-28T15:13:46 <kasparnet> "providers", to provide Vagrant with resources to run development
2015-10-28T15:13:48 <kasparnet> environments. Examples are VirtualBox, VMware, Hyper-V.
2015-10-28T15:13:50 <kasparnet> The easiest solution to this message is to install VirtualBox, which
2015-10-28T15:13:52 <kasparnet> is available for free on all major platforms.
2015-10-28T15:13:54 <kasparnet> If you believe you already have a provider available, make sure it
2015-10-28T15:13:56 <kasparnet> is properly installed and configured. You can see more details about
2015-10-28T15:13:58 <kasparnet> why a particular provider isn\'t working by forcing usage with
2015-10-28T15:14:00 <kasparnet> `vagrant up --provider=PROVIDER`, which should give you a more specific
2015-10-28T15:14:02 <kasparnet> error message for that particular provider.
2015-10-28T15:14:04 <kasparnet> avtar: ^
2015-10-28T15:14:06 <kasparnet> and i do have virutalbox installed
2015-10-28T15:14:15 <kasparnet> (I can run "VirtualBox" from the command line and it opens)
2015-10-28T15:14:34 <simonjb> kasparnet: if you have any time, I\'d like to chat with you about the \'default privacy settings\'
2015-10-28T15:14:42 <kasparnet> avtar: vagrant up --provider=VirtualBox doesn\'t work
2015-10-28T15:15:58 <avtar> oh that\'s bizarre
2015-10-28T15:16:01 <kasparnet> hey simonjb - sure, how long a talk do you think it is
2015-10-28T15:16:07 <avtar> i don\'t think anyone has had to specify a provider
2015-10-28T15:16:20 <kasparnet> it\'s on a mac
2015-10-28T15:16:25 <simonjb> kasparnet: maybe 15-30 mins
2015-10-28T15:16:42 <avtar> kasparnet: what version of virtualbox and vagrant do you have installed
2015-10-28T15:16:43 <avtar> ?
2015-10-28T15:17:28 <kasparnet> avtar: VBox 5.0.8, vagrant 1.7.2
2015-10-28T15:18:08 <kasparnet> ok simonjb, let\'s do it
2015-10-28T15:18:33 <simonjb> kasparnet: can we chat on vidyo?
2015-10-28T15:18:38 <kasparnet> sure
2015-10-28T15:18:43 <avtar> kasparnet: would it be possible for you to share your screen with me?
2015-10-28T15:18:45 <simonjb> call me when it\'s good
2015-10-28T15:18:46 <avtar> when you\'re done with simonjb
2015-10-28T15:23:12 <avtar> kasparnet: also the provider name needs to be in lowercase https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/virtualbox/usage.html

2015-10-28T15:52:41 <Bosmon> avtar - awesome, thanks!
2015-10-28T15:52:47 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: gpii-express question. how are query parameters handled?
2015-10-28T15:53:16 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I imagine they end up in req.params as with all express-based systems
2015-10-28T15:53:38 <the-t-in-rtf> Justin_o: when working with a requestAware router, the handler ends up with that.request
2015-10-28T15:54:02 <the-t-in-rtf> whatever middleware you have should have added that.request.query, that.request.params, etc.
2015-10-28T15:54:16 <Justin_o> Bosmon, the-t-in-rtf: thanks
2015-10-28T15:54:33 <the-t-in-rtf> Of course, you have to include the relevant middleware.
2015-10-28T15:54:44 <the-t-in-rtf> I have wrapped the common stuff to give you a request body, query, etc.
2015-10-28T15:55:00 <the-t-in-rtf> cookies, session, etc.
2015-10-28T15:55:22 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: i\'m using a gpii.express.contentAware.router for that endpoint
2015-10-28T15:56:05 <the-t-in-rtf> That follows the same contract.
2015-10-28T15:56:12 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: great
2015-10-28T15:56:13 <Justin_o> thanks
2015-10-28T15:56:19 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, here\'s an example of a test with the basic middleware wired in:  https://github.com/GPII/gpii-express/blob/master/tests/js/middleware/middleware-tests.js#L90
2015-10-28T15:56:57 <the-t-in-rtf> Between them, those tests work with path parameters, query variables, cookies, and session data, so take a look around.
2015-10-28T15:57:06 <the-t-in-rtf> also body data
2015-10-28T15:57:40 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: thanks for the examples
2015-10-28T15:59:34 <the-t-in-rtf> Please do ask if anything is not clear, I have probably lost all objectivity about that code and just do it out of habit.  It would be good for me to have to explain it now and again and will help me when I finally write tutorial content.
2015-10-28T15:59:35 <the-t-in-rtf> :)
2015-10-28T16:00:03 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - I was saying just the same thing to slim_ yesterday :)

2015-10-28T16:09:27 <clown> kasparnet, has Europe made the time switch already?
2015-10-28T16:09:37 <kasparnet> that Justin_o is such a showoff
2015-10-28T16:10:24 <kasparnet> clown, avtar, colinclark, michelled, sgithens: Due to Europe having drifted into a parralel timeline, the architecture meeting will be in one hr
2015-10-28T16:11:06 <kasparnet> avtar: ok - vagrant 1.7.4 works better

2015-10-28T16:28:21 <Bosmon> Whatever happened to an entire OS that used to fit within 16K :)

2015-10-28T16:28:41 <kasparnet> stupid progress

2015-10-28T12:25:09 <slim_> thanks for testing
2015-10-28T12:26:12 <slim_> jhernandez: thanks - am rather pleased. went though a few iterations

2015-10-28T13:19:47 <Justin_o> Bosmon: I\'m reading through this https://github.com/amb26/kettle/tree/KETTLE-32#simple-example-of-using-an-http-datasource
2015-10-28T13:20:07 <Justin_o> but i\'m not sure how the directModel in a get/set method works with the termMap that is in the dataSources options
2015-10-28T13:20:46 <Justin_o> I do see that there is a paragraph about this, but I\'m not understanding it very well.
2015-10-28T13:20:49 <Bosmon> Justin_o - sorry, there\'s also an error in that doc section
2015-10-28T13:20:54 <Justin_o> oh okay
2015-10-28T13:21:02 <Bosmon> It should read "directPostId" rather than "%directPostId" in the termMap
2015-10-28T13:21:26 <Justin_o> Bosmon: ah, so "directPostId" is actually a path into the directModel?
2015-10-28T13:21:31 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes
2015-10-28T13:21:41 <Justin_o> okay, thanks, i get it now
2015-10-28T13:22:28 <Justin_o> Bosmon:  how would i get the port number in the url without having to pass it in to each get/set call?
2015-10-28T13:22:43 <Justin_o> but also still make it configurable
2015-10-28T13:24:06 <Bosmon> Justin_o - all options supported by node\'s http request https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_http_request_options_callback  are also supported as top-level options on the dataSource
2015-10-28T13:24:12 <Bosmon> Thanks for helping me debug this documentation :)
2015-10-28T13:24:48 <Bosmon> Justin_o - for example, https://github.com/amb26/kettle/blob/KETTLE-32/tests/DataSourceTests.js#L26
2015-10-28T13:25:52 <Justin_o> Bosmon:  :) glad to help
2015-10-28T13:26:23 <Justin_o> Bosmon: what happens if i pass in "url" and "host" options for example. Does one take precedence?
2015-10-28T13:32:03 <Bosmon> Justin_o - the url itself consists of the weakest options
2015-10-28T13:32:07 <Bosmon> Everything else merges on top of that
2015-10-28T13:33:26 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay, thanks.

2015-10-28T14:50:18 <Justin_o> Bosmon: for the kettle datasource how would i pass in different headers for each request
2015-10-28T14:50:31 <Justin_o> or do i need separate datasources for that?
2015-10-28T14:50:38 <Bosmon> Justin_o - these can be passed in the final argument to the dataSource method
2015-10-28T14:50:41 <Bosmon> The one named "options"
2015-10-28T14:51:42 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks, does this also accept anything the node\'s http request accepts?
2015-10-28T14:51:50 <Bosmon> Justin_o - it does, yes
2015-10-28T14:51:56 <Justin_o> thanks
2015-10-28T14:52:22 <Bosmon> https://github.com/amb26/kettle/blob/KETTLE-32/tests/DataSourceTests.js#L59
2015-10-28T14:52:31 <Bosmon> Believe me, this blasted thing has been implemented properly at long last : P
2015-10-28T14:52:40 <Bosmon> That only took a mere 7 years since the Engage days......
2015-10-28T14:53:17 <Justin_o> thanks for the test example.
2015-10-28T14:53:38 <avtar> colinclark: i was catching up on irc logs and saw this https://botbot.me/freenode/fluid-work/2015-10-27/?msg=52883890&page=8
2015-10-28T14:53:42 <Justin_o> :) it\'s been 7 years, but we haven\'t be working on these types of interactions for all that time
2015-10-28T14:53:51 <Bosmon> On and off
2015-10-28T14:53:58 <Bosmon> It\'s still not perfectly right, but at least the user API is correct now
2015-10-28T14:54:21 <Bosmon> It needs to be refactored one stage further so that the "original source" just looks like another transform element
2015-10-28T14:54:40 <Bosmon> In this case, a transform which transforms NOTHING into the required payload : P
2015-10-28T14:54:40 <Justin_o> Bosmon:  cool :) could we also split this off from kettle later, so we could have the requests but not the rest of the kettle infrastructure
2015-10-28T14:54:45 <avtar> particularly how you\'re installing node-pre-gyp https://github.com/colinbdclark/osc.js/pull/34/files#diff-d6d618aa6069c63a6811c544dffdc9d2R28
2015-10-28T14:55:00 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, this will eventually be amalgamated with your long-mouldering Infusion pull request
2015-10-28T14:55:32 <Justin_o> Bosmon: this one https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/566 ?
2015-10-28T14:55:46 <Bosmon> Justin_o yes, that one
2015-10-28T14:55:47 <avtar> listing it using nodejs_app_npm_packages https://github.com/idi-ops/ansible-nodejs/blob/master/defaults/main.yml#L18 will let you do that as well
2015-10-28T14:56:03 <avtar> like how you\'re installing gcc-c++
2015-10-28T14:56:30 <Justin_o> Bosmon: it\'ll be great when we get all this in
2015-10-28T14:56:46 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes
2015-10-28T14:56:55 <Bosmon> In the meantime, I have lots of documentation to fix : P
2015-10-28T14:57:59 <Justin_o> :)
2015-10-28T14:58:47 <colinclark> avtar: this is great
2015-10-28T14:59:00 <colinclark> I shouldn\'t have to install node-pre-gyp like this at lal
2015-10-28T14:59:02 <colinclark> all
2015-10-28T14:59:11 <Bosmon> NODE-PRE-GYP!!!!
2015-10-28T14:59:21 <colinclark> but for whatever reason, in the Vagrant environment it simply refused to recognize it unless it was globally installed
2015-10-28T14:59:23 <colinclark> which is idiotic
2015-10-28T14:59:57 <colinclark> avtar: You think that it should be visible if in install it as part of the nodejs_app_npm_packages phase of box provisioning?
2015-10-28T15:01:17 <avtar> colinclark: yes, it should be
2015-10-28T15:01:20 <colinclark> ok, cool
2015-10-28T15:01:21 <colinclark> I\'ll try that
2015-10-28T15:01:42 <avtar> like so https://github.com/avtar/linux/blob/GPII-1258/provisioning/vars.yml#L39-L40
2015-10-28T15:01:53 <colinclark> cool
2015-10-28T15:02:03 <colinclark> so you\'ve seen this sort of thing before, avtar :)
2015-10-28T15:02:11 <colinclark> does node-gyp include node-pre-gyp?
2015-10-28T15:02:19 <colinclark> I guess probably not
2015-10-28T15:02:26 <avtar> i\'m not sure to be honest
2015-10-28T15:02:36 <kasparnet> jhernandez, Bosmon: are you up for doing the architecture meeting one hr. early today?
2015-10-28T15:02:39 <avtar> i was playing around until i got to that point
2015-10-28T15:02:45 <colinclark> kasparnet: EARLY!
2015-10-28T15:02:47 <colinclark> I can\'t
2015-10-28T15:02:54 <kasparnet> this would be the regular time for you
2015-10-28T15:03:03 <colinclark> I assumed we were keeping it pegged to EURO TIME
2015-10-28T15:03:11 <kasparnet> oh ok -- lets keep it like that
2015-10-28T15:03:12 <colinclark> and michelled is leading a Floe planning meeting at the usual time
2015-10-28T15:03:16 <colinclark> sorry :(
2015-10-28T15:03:22 <Bosmon> At the USUAL TIME
2015-10-28T15:03:26 <kasparnet> yeah
2015-10-28T15:03:31 <kasparnet> what does that mean colin?
2015-10-28T15:03:45 <kasparnet> so we should have it 1 hour late in canada
2015-10-28T15:03:48 <colinclark> WE ARE IN DIFFERENT TIME STREAMS
2015-10-28T15:03:49 <Bosmon> So Fish is having Floe planning 1 hour from now?
2015-10-28T15:03:56 <kasparnet> regular time for us europeans?
2015-10-28T15:03:57 <colinclark> YOU ARE STILL IN YOUR USUAL TIME
2015-10-28T15:03:58 <colinclark> WE ARE NOT
2015-10-28T15:04:04 <colinclark> help us
2015-10-28T15:04:07 <Bosmon> No we are not
2015-10-28T15:04:11 <Bosmon> It is YOU who are in your usual time!
2015-10-28T15:04:18 <colinclark> oh
2015-10-28T15:04:19 <colinclark> yes
2015-10-28T15:04:19 <kasparnet> I totally agree with Bosmon
2015-10-28T15:04:23 <kasparnet> :D
2015-10-28T15:04:24 <colinclark> YOU ARE NOT IN YOUR USUAL TIME
2015-10-28T15:04:36 <Bosmon> WELCOME TO THE TWO STREAMS FACILITY
2015-10-28T15:04:38 <colinclark> Well no wait
2015-10-28T15:04:40 <Bosmon> THIS IS A *KINDNESS*
2015-10-28T15:04:43 <avtar> kasparnet: any chance you were able to verify what i\'m seeing here http://piratepad.net/c4a-arch-21-10-2015 starting at line 46
2015-10-28T15:04:46 <colinclark> THE NEW TIME IS THE NEW USUAL
2015-10-28T15:04:49 <colinclark> I\'m so confused
2015-10-28T15:04:54 <colinclark> and need to stop typing in capitals
2015-10-28T15:04:57 <Bosmon> sgithens ^
2015-10-28T15:05:26 <colinclark> Anyway, let\'s all pretend we\'re in Europe
2015-10-28T15:05:29 <colinclark> I certainly wish I was
2015-10-28T15:05:54 <colinclark> and in Europe, THE ARCHITECTURE MEETING IS ALWAYS AT 18:00
2015-10-28T15:06:11 <colinclark> Of course, in Europe I have slept in really really late
2015-10-28T15:06:13 <colinclark> but that\'s okay
2015-10-28T15:06:25 <colinclark> Bosmon does that all the time from his little outpost island off the coast of EUROPE
2015-10-28T15:06:30 <Bosmon> Yes
2015-10-28T15:06:33 <Bosmon> Sometimes I visit EUROPE
2015-10-28T15:06:35 <Bosmon> Like I did on Sunday
2015-10-28T15:07:49 <kasparnet> avtar: including the vagrant stuff?
2015-10-28T15:08:00 <avtar> kasparnet: yes
2015-10-28T15:08:12 <colinclark> Did you visit the Spotted Ox Hotel while you were there, Bosmon?
2015-10-28T15:08:16 <colinclark> Hostel
2015-10-28T15:08:22 <kasparnet> so should I be in linux, or could I be in any env?
2015-10-28T15:08:28 <Bosmon> I didn\'t
2015-10-28T15:08:39 <Bosmon> There were no SOWSIDGES
2015-10-28T15:08:57 <kasparnet> and do I need to run the regular install process, or do I just download and do vagrant up, and magic shit happens
2015-10-28T15:09:25 <avtar> kasparnet: any environment as long as you address these requirements https://github.com/avtar/linux/blob/GPII-1258/README.md#requirements
2015-10-28T15:09:37 <avtar> kasparnet: shit will happen
2015-10-28T15:12:29 <kasparnet> A Vagrant environment or target machine is required to run this
2015-10-28T15:12:29 <kasparnet> command. Run `vagrant init` to create a new Vagrant environment. Or,
2015-10-28T15:12:29 <kasparnet> get an ID of a target machine from `vagrant global-status` to run
