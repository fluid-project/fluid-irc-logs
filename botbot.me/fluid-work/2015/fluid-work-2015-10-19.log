b'2015-10-19T23:24:23 <Bosmon7> Is there a way we can see the logs from the provisioning operations?
2015-10-19T23:26:19 <Bosmon7> Where are the provisioning operations actually encoded.......
2015-10-19T23:34:41 <avtar> Bosmon, Bosmon7: sorry i was afk, by the windows 7 test machine
2015-10-19T23:34:47 <avtar> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/e7af837f3d2e4ad0eedb
2015-10-19T23:36:04 <avtar> i\'ll poke around for logs
2015-10-19T23:36:05 <avtar> one sec
2015-10-19T23:42:08 <avtar> Bosmon7: you can try this command from your cygwin host\'s side
2015-10-19T23:42:59 <avtar> vagrant ssh -c \'sudo PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 ansible-playbook -v /home/vagrant/sync/provisioning/playbook.yml --tags="install,configure,deploy"\'
2015-10-19T23:43:05 <avtar> http://pastie.org/pastes/10494043/text
2015-10-19T23:43:25 <avtar> it won\'t look pretty btw
2015-10-19T23:44:12 <avtar> but for the last task i see "Running \\"dedupe-infusion\\" task\\u001b[24m\
\\u001b
2015-10-19T23:44:12 <avtar> [32m>> \\u001b[39mFound 1 infusions\
\
\\u001b[32mDone, without errors."
2015-10-19T23:53:20 <avtar> Bosmon7, Bosmon
2015-10-19T23:53:27 <avtar> just thought of something
2015-10-19T23:53:39 <avtar> could you please share the contents of your vars/requirements.yml file?
2015-10-19T23:53:54 <avtar> err sorry

2015-10-19T23:55:28 <avtar> i thought i might have pointed you to the wrong branch but that looks fine as well
2015-10-19T23:55:28 <avtar> hmm
2015-10-19T23:55:41 <Bosmon> Just running the command you sent earlier
2015-10-19T23:55:43 <Bosmon> very slowly
2015-10-19T23:56:25 <Bosmon> Can\'t I just log into the damn thing?
2015-10-19T23:56:30 <Bosmon> What\'s the vagrant password
2015-10-19T23:57:01 <avtar> i was thinking of what might be different on the win7 box i have access to but at this point it\'s not even a windows issue since the tasks are being run in the vm
2015-10-19T23:57:05 <avtar> the password is vagrant
2015-10-19T23:57:12 <Bosmon> It didn\'t accept it
2015-10-19T23:57:24 <Bosmon> So I got the output from the dedupe command, it says that there is only 1 infusion
2015-10-19T23:58:05 <Bosmon> But then it runs it a 2nd time
2015-10-19T23:58:09 <Bosmon> and finds 4 infusions
2015-10-19T23:58:27 <Bosmon> ok
2015-10-19T23:59:08 <Bosmon7> Deleted a bunch from paths like /tmp/first-discovery-server-build-dir/node_modules/gpii-express/node_modules/infusion
2015-10-19T23:59:35 <Bosmon7> It seems for some reason you decided to use rsync for your copy operation
2015-10-19T23:59:38 <Bosmon7> You must be unusually fond of it : P
2015-10-19T23:59:51 <avtar> i tried cp first :)
2015-10-19T23:59:58 <Bosmon7> The problem was?

2015-10-19T20:36:22 <avtar> colinclark: could you try spinning up the vm using this vars.yml? https://gist.githubusercontent.com/avtar/60e50f59cc7bf256b730/raw/04fb2509a3c136d12099462c90dc6a9d8dd24746/gistfile1.txt
2015-10-19T20:36:34 <avtar> it adds a c++ compiler
2015-10-19T20:36:54 <avtar> and fixes the ssh issue by using /home/vagrant/sync as the app\'s directory
2015-10-19T20:37:15 <avtar> i\'ll make the path a default so that this doesn\'t happen again
2015-10-19T20:37:39 <colinclark> aha, yes
2015-10-19T20:37:58 <colinclark> I didn\'t imagine there was a linux distro out there that ships without a C++ compiler
2015-10-19T20:38:07 <colinclark> but I guess our box is VERY SLEEK
2015-10-19T20:38:09 <Bosmon> avtar - I would love to, but I realise this would mean rebooting my machine for that BIOS setting........
2015-10-19T20:38:14 <Bosmon> I guess I can try it on my laptop
2015-10-19T20:38:21 <colinclark> as gtirloni says, WE\'RE SMALLER THAN COREOS
2015-10-19T20:38:22 <Bosmon> Which hugely increases the risk of npm thrashing issues anyway
2015-10-19T20:38:30 <colinclark> Bosmon: Have you been using OS/2 recently?
2015-10-19T20:38:42 <Bosmon> colinclark - no, I haven\'t started my OS/2 image for a while
2015-10-19T20:39:00 <Bosmon> Although I did recently look over the github repo for a torrent client that proudly advertised its OS/2 support :)
2015-10-19T20:39:00 <avtar> Bosmon: please be sure to \'vagrant destroy -f\' before testing
2015-10-19T20:39:41 <Bosmon> What is it with you ops types and destruction
2015-10-19T20:40:21 <avtar> Bosmon: everything that rises passes away
2015-10-19T20:40:53 <Bosmon> Yes
2015-10-19T20:41:00 <colinclark> Offered without comment: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/8c33cd430943c964fb3e5e6a0b971f74bd83be4a/src/framework/core/js/Fluid.js#L1344
2015-10-19T20:41:10 <Bosmon> He flees LIKE A SHADOW and CONTINUES NOT
2015-10-19T20:41:31 <gtirloni> we\'re 123MB smaller than coreos, just sayin...
2015-10-19T20:41:45 <gtirloni> oops, 103MB only
2015-10-19T20:41:47 <Bosmon> Well, you see.... all this does is NOTATES destruction :)
2015-10-19T20:42:10 <alanharnum> this seems like a good time to share my important project: https://github.com/waharnum/silverbullet
2015-10-19T20:42:18 <Bosmon> crikey
2015-10-19T20:42:27 <alanharnum> speaking of destruction
2015-10-19T20:42:30 <Bosmon> WAHARNUM has created that which Brooks has proved is impossible

2015-10-19T20:43:06 <Bosmon> Yes
2015-10-19T20:43:14 <Bosmon> Sadly my system is mostly immune to your bullet
2015-10-19T20:43:28 <alanharnum> i regret to say that this probably won\'t work on Windows
2015-10-19T20:43:33 <alanharnum> though it might in Cygwin!
2015-10-19T20:43:52 <alanharnum> Windows support is on the roadmap
2015-10-19T20:43:52 <Bosmon> Well, I think it wouldn\'t end up deleting very much in the end
2015-10-19T20:44:14 <Bosmon> Probably just the little fake bit of "root filesystem" and the mount points : P
2015-10-19T20:44:22 <Bosmon> It might delete a lot of cygwin itself
2015-10-19T20:44:25 <colinclark> alanharnum, can you come over and help me with my computer?
2015-10-19T20:44:32 <colinclark> I ran your awesome new project
2015-10-19T20:44:36 <colinclark> and now the screen is black
2015-10-19T20:44:50 <Bosmon> How can you even observe the screen
2015-10-19T20:45:02 <Bosmon> If the project were even working properly, that should have been deleted too
2015-10-19T20:45:07 <Bosmon> You\'ve seen the SELF video......
2015-10-19T20:46:07 <gtirloni> alanharnum: it\'d be nice if the road map included erasing the bios flash

2015-10-19T20:50:19 <colinclark> This Philip Larkin reading rules
2015-10-19T20:50:20 <Bosmon> If only they could
2015-10-19T20:50:35 <Bosmon> Sadly their perpetually rotting corpse will be reanimated endlessly by Ellison
2015-10-19T20:51:22 <Bosmon> Ah yes, VAPPORIZE :)
2015-10-19T20:57:33 <colinclark> ah, avtar, serious progress
2015-10-19T20:57:50 <colinclark> So is there a way I can make this box run an npm command instead of "node"
2015-10-19T20:58:00 <colinclark> I\'m encountering the dreaded Infusion dedupe issue
2015-10-19T20:58:08 <colinclark> which if I run "npm test" is taken care of for me
2015-10-19T20:58:50 <colinclark> and provision runs for me again-totally awesome
2015-10-19T20:59:14 <gtirloni> colinclark: check provisioning/vars.yml -- the nodejs_app_commands list
2015-10-19T20:59:50 <colinclark> aha, ok
2015-10-19T20:59:53 <gtirloni> https://github.com/idi-ops/ansible-nodejs/blob/master/defaults/main.yml#L101-L103
2015-10-19T21:00:37 <colinclark> thanks
2015-10-19T21:00:56 * sepidehshahi has left the channel
2015-10-19T21:01:21 <colinclark> and if, speculatively, I\'d want to make a thing that ran, say, "electron" instead of "node," I\'d actually have to produce a new ansible role to do so, is that correct?
2015-10-19T21:04:39 <avtar> hmm we didn\'t take electron into account :/
2015-10-19T21:04:42 <avtar> https://github.com/idi-ops/ansible-nodejs/blob/master/vars/RedHat.yml#L2
2015-10-19T21:06:36 <avtar> i think it might be possible to use the role for the most part if that nodejs_executable variable to defaults/main.yml
2015-10-19T21:06:39 <avtar> gtirloni: thoughts?
2015-10-19T21:07:04 <colinclark> I\'m not suggesting that you should have taken electron into account
2015-10-19T21:07:13 <colinclark> I\'m just trying to understand the "space" of these tools
2015-10-19T21:08:01 <colinclark> I guess there are probably projects out there that typically start their apps using something like "npm start" for example
2015-10-19T21:08:17 <colinclark> but maybe that\'s sufficient to require a new role
2015-10-19T21:08:29 * kasparne_ has quit
2015-10-19T21:09:13 <colinclark> gtirloni or avtar, my other question is whether there\'s a way to control the version of node used by the box?
2015-10-19T21:09:14 <gtirloni> electron would be for GUI apps, right?
2015-10-19T21:09:17 <colinclark> is there a parameter I\'m missing
2015-10-19T21:09:20 <colinclark> gtirloni: yes
2015-10-19T21:09:23 <colinclark> it\'s a bit of a stretch
2015-10-19T21:09:33 <colinclark> I do run it headless on a linux box
2015-10-19T21:09:42 <colinclark> but I don\'t think most sane people will do this :)
2015-10-19T21:09:52 <gtirloni> colinclark: you can pick any version as long as it\'s 0.10.36, 0.10.40 or 4.2.0 :) https://github.com/idi-ops/ansible-nodejs/blob/master/vars/RedHat.yml#L10-L13
2015-10-19T21:10:10 <colinclark> hahaha
2015-10-19T21:10:32 <colinclark> I love how I can choose between two apparently interchangeable versions of 0.10.x :)
2015-10-19T21:10:39 <colinclark> That\'s choice!
2015-10-19T21:11:05 <gtirloni> yeah, 0.10.36 (what centos ship and we\'ve been using for a while) and the less buggy version 0.10.40 now that we use nodesource
2015-10-19T21:11:26 <colinclark> gtirloni: So I would specify a "nodejs_centos_rpms" variable in my vars.yml file?
2015-10-19T21:11:57 <gtirloni> colinclark: nodejs_version instead (https://github.com/idi-ops/ansible-nodejs/blob/master/defaults/main.yml#L7)
2015-10-19T21:12:05 <colinclark> ah, got it
2015-10-19T21:12:05 * yzen is now known as yzen_
2015-10-19T21:12:28 <colinclark> thanks--I\'m asking dumb questions and should just read through the main.yml file :)
2015-10-19T21:12:55 <gtirloni> no worries
2015-10-19T21:13:32 <gtirloni> re: electron and this role... if changing nodejs_executable works, but.. right now we take care of installing node from a packaged/trusted source, i don\'t know how mature electron packages are
2015-10-19T21:13:41 <gtirloni> (or if they exist)
2015-10-19T21:17:05 * anastasiac has quit
2015-10-19T21:22:24 <colinclark> Can I override any variable?
2015-10-19T21:22:54 <avtar> as long as it\'s in defaults/main.yml
2015-10-19T21:22:54 <colinclark> Can I just be all wicked and override nodejs_executable if I wanted to?
2015-10-19T21:23:02 <colinclark> ok
2015-10-19T21:23:03 <avtar> the ones in vars/* not so much
2015-10-19T21:23:06 <colinclark> got it
2015-10-19T21:24:02 <colinclark> avtar: I\'m having a new issue...
2015-10-19T21:24:07 <avtar> gtirloni: speaking of nodesource packages
2015-10-19T21:24:13 <colinclark> It\'s pretty clear that something during "npm install" is failing
2015-10-19T21:24:23 <colinclark> but I don\'t see anything in the console about it while provisioning
2015-10-19T21:24:24 <avtar> what are your thoughts re: building them using idi\'s jenkins instance?
2015-10-19T21:24:36 <colinclark> but shouldn\'t I?
2015-10-19T21:25:02 <avtar> colinclark: yes you should see something
2015-10-19T21:25:21 <avtar> i was able to see errors when g++ wasn\'t found
2015-10-19T21:25:25 <colinclark> hmm
2015-10-19T21:25:31 <colinclark> I\'m not sure I ever saw those before, either
2015-10-19T21:26:07 <avtar> what happens if you remove that gcc-c++ change and then try provisioning?
2015-10-19T21:27:38 <avtar> https://gist.githubusercontent.com/anonymous/b57c8acd8ceecd4990d5/raw/720988de06c0638ba9526bd20d40dcbbed7c0f77/gistfile1.txt
2015-10-19T21:27:42 <colinclark> destroy the box and reprovision?
2015-10-19T21:27:47 <avtar> colinclark: ^ that is what i saw
2015-10-19T21:27:57 <colinclark> man, you\'re so lucky!
2015-10-19T21:28:11 <gtirloni> avtar: it\'d be nice to build them ourselves yes
2015-10-19T21:29:18 <avtar> gtirloni: the only reason i mention it is because nodesource didn\'t seem super committed to supporting fedora releases
2015-10-19T21:29:29 <avtar> more so debian and ubuntu
2015-10-19T21:29:31 <colinclark> avtar: silence

2015-10-19T22:40:52 <Bosmon> Hi there avtar - relatively good news
2015-10-19T22:41:06 <Bosmon> Your vagrant box seems to NEARLY work on my crappy Win 7 machine
2015-10-19T22:41:31 <Bosmon> Unfortunately the dedupe-infusion step didn\'t run properly, but hopefully this is just a matter of you not having updated from Justin_o\'s version of the tool
2015-10-19T22:45:10 <Bosmon> hmm
2015-10-19T22:45:15 <Bosmon> Well, maybe not
2015-10-19T22:45:21 <Bosmon> Your scripts should actually be working....
2015-10-19T22:46:08 <Bosmon> https://github.com/avtar/first-discovery-server/blob/FLOE-423/provisioning/vars.yml#L7
2015-10-19T22:46:14 <Bosmon> Not clear that this is actually running
2015-10-19T22:49:50 <Bosmon> Well, it seems to be running from the vagrant console trace
2015-10-19T22:49:57 <Bosmon> But the logs in the machine show that startup failed
2015-10-19T23:01:48 <avtar> Bosmon: hmm
2015-10-19T23:02:10 <avtar> and this is on a brand new vm? after \'vagrant destroy\'?
2015-10-19T23:02:13 <Bosmon> I\'ll tinker a bit further, it\'s not really clear what happened
2015-10-19T23:02:16 <Bosmon> Yes, brand new vm
2015-10-19T23:02:50 <avtar> i\'ll try it again on the win 7 machine here
2015-10-19T23:22:39 <Bosmon7> avtar - yes, everything seems ok, but the dedupe just hasn\'t run
2015-10-19T23:22:47 <Bosmon7> I guess your copy commands aren\'t quite correct
2015-10-19T23:23:04 <Bosmon7> Oct 19 23:22:23 first-discovery-server nodemon[4337]: 23:22:23.922:  FATAL ERROR: Uncaught exception: Object Error loading infusion - infusion has already been loaded from the path

2015-10-19T17:07:59 <anastasiac> cindyli: regarding the FD tool prefs server integration: the new docs mention a token panel: Is that code in master yet? If not, which branch would I find it in, to try it out?
2015-10-19T17:23:51 <Bosmon> Thanks, Justin_o - fresh round of feedback for you

2015-10-19T17:41:19 <cindyli> anastasiac: the code for the token panel is already in the master. to see that, launch this demo: demos/prefsServerIntegration/. It\'s specifically for integrating the first discovery tool and the preferences server
2015-10-19T17:42:07 <anastasiac> ah, ok. cindyli, Justin_o: Should the FD tool/prefs server integration demo be added to the build site?
2015-10-19T17:43:33 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks,  if only I could spell correctly, i\'d have half as many changes to make :(
2015-10-19T17:44:02 <Bosmon> Justin_o - an IDE with a spell checker? : P
2015-10-19T17:44:49 <Justin_o> Bosmon: sadly it mine does have one :(
2015-10-19T17:45:35 <Justin_o> anastasiac: i think it could be, for now you\'ll get an error message instead of the token though
2015-10-19T17:45:39 <Justin_o> cindyli: what do you think?
2015-10-19T17:46:32 <anastasiac> cindyli, Justin_o: Is the fd tool master not deployed to the build site automatically? the prefsServerIntegration demo isn\xe2\x80\x99t there\xe2\x80\xa6
2015-10-19T17:46:34 <anastasiac> http://build.fluidproject.org/first-discovery/demos/prefsServerIntegration/
2015-10-19T17:49:56 <Justin_o> anastasiac: i\'m not sure, maybe gtirloni knows?

2015-10-19T17:54:55 <gtirloni> anastasiac Justin_o: this is what the fd tool build creates and gets deployed - http://pastie.org/10493442
2015-10-19T17:55:44 <gtirloni> more complete listing - http://pastie.org/10493443
2015-10-19T17:56:27 <anastasiac> gtirloni: is this controlled by something specific? There\xe2\x80\x99s a new demo in the demos folder, \xe2\x80\x9cprefsServerIntegration\xe2\x80\x9d, that should probably be deployed as well
2015-10-19T17:57:54 <gtirloni> the last time a build for first-discovery was triggered was Sept 28, when was this added?
2015-10-19T17:58:25 <anastasiac> gtirloni: \xe2\x80\x9c20 days ago\xe2\x80\x9d which isn\xe2\x80\x99t helpful without some mental math :-)
2015-10-19T17:59:18 <anastasiac> hm. 20 day is after the 28th, i.e. the 29th
2015-10-19T17:59:21 <gtirloni> i triggered a build manually and it the demo is there now
2015-10-19T17:59:32 * michelled joined the channel
2015-10-19T17:59:45 <anastasiac> excellent, gtirloni. Any idea why it didn\xe2\x80\x99t work on the last commit?
2015-10-19T18:00:01 <gtirloni> Justin_o: could you double check fluid-project/first-discovery\'s webhook?
2015-10-19T18:00:11 <michelled> colinclark, jessm: would you like to meet in my vidyo room?
2015-10-19T18:00:21 <jessm> michelled: sure \xe2\x80\x94 be there in 2 minutes?
2015-10-19T18:00:27 <michelled> sounds good
2015-10-19T18:06:59 <Justin_o> gtirloni: well that\'s another issue
2015-10-19T18:07:18 <Justin_o> gtirloni: the first-discovery repo has been moved to the GPII github space today
2015-10-19T18:07:24 <Justin_o> gtirloni: so i don\'t have access to check
2015-10-19T18:07:35 <Justin_o> Bosmon, kasparne_ : can either of you help gtirloni
2015-10-19T18:08:42 <avtar> gtirloni: the first-discovery jjb config will need to be changed as well
2015-10-19T18:09:07 <avtar> to include the repo\'s new url
2015-10-19T18:10:06 <gtirloni> i\'ve updated it today, but it seems this commit was done 20 days ago so i\'m wondering why it hasn\'t triggered a build

2015-10-19T18:25:07 <colinclark> I assumed you\'d be off today
2015-10-19T18:25:22 <michelled> I mostly am :)
2015-10-19T18:26:07 <colinclark> I am getting Vidyo errors
2015-10-19T18:26:21 <colinclark> "Failed to establish connection with the router (error 1003)"
2015-10-19T18:27:03 <michelled> oh no!
2015-10-19T18:27:13 <michelled> that happened to me before and I restarted my machine
2015-10-19T18:27:18 <michelled> and then it all worked
2015-10-19T18:27:19 <Bosmon> gtirloni - what is a webhook? : P
2015-10-19T18:27:26 <michelled> I think I had that issue when I upgraded

2015-10-19T18:54:47 <gtirloni> since it points to jira :)
2015-10-19T18:54:53 <gtirloni> maybe there are other webhooks
2015-10-19T19:00:08 <Justin_o> Bosmon, gtirloni: there may be multiple hooks and some of them might be configured in different ways.
2015-10-19T19:00:48 <Justin_o> Bosmon: also, i don\'t have access to the settings for the first-discovery repos on gpii, maybe you have to be an owner
2015-10-19T19:00:53 <Bosmon> Yes there\'s one pointing to https://ci.fluidproject.org/github-webhook/
2015-10-19T19:00:57 <Bosmon> Ok, I\'ll add permissions
2015-10-19T19:02:03 <Bosmon> Ok Justin_o you should be admin now
2015-10-19T19:02:20 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks :)
2015-10-19T19:03:39 <Justin_o> gtirloni: did you want me to send a test request from the web hook?

2015-10-19T19:05:07 <gtirloni> Justin_o: yes please

2015-10-19T19:09:06 <Justin_o> gtirloni: i updated the url and sent a test
2015-10-19T19:09:18 <gtirloni> looks like it\'s working
2015-10-19T19:09:18 <gtirloni> INFO: Received POST for https://github.com/GPII/first-discovery
2015-10-19T19:12:26 <Justin_o> gtirloni: cool
2015-10-19T19:12:38 <Justin_o> should all of our web hooks be updated to use ci-int?
2015-10-19T19:12:43 <Justin_o> gtirloni: ^
2015-10-19T19:12:53 <gtirloni> yep
2015-10-19T19:18:18 <Justin_o> gtirloni: okay i\'ll try to check the rest
2015-10-19T19:36:13 <Justin_o> gtirloni: is it an issue to add this web hook to repos that aren\'t yet being built by jenkins?
2015-10-19T19:37:02 <gtirloni> i don\'t think so. if any notification arrives, jenkins will reject it for repositories it doesn\'t know
2015-10-19T19:37:06 <gtirloni> so it\'s okay
2015-10-19T19:37:25 <Justin_o> gtirloni: cool thanks, i think i\'ll just add it to everything if it isn\'t already there
2015-10-19T19:37:59 <Justin_o> Bosmon: can you make me an admin on first-discovery-server too
2015-10-19T19:38:44 <Bosmon> Justin_o - done

2015-10-19T20:22:16 <Bosmon> Hello there AVVTTAR
2015-10-19T20:22:42 <avtar> how are things?
2015-10-19T20:27:29 <Bosmon> avtar - they are sort of reasonable
2015-10-19T20:27:37 <Bosmon> Although I have been in a DOCKUMENTATION HELL for some weeks now
2015-10-19T20:28:18 <colinclark> Bosmon: This fix is INCORRECT: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/643/files#diff-04c6e90faac2675aa89e2176d2eec7d8R4
2015-10-19T20:28:23 <Bosmon> !!!!!!!
2015-10-19T20:28:38 <Bosmon> colinclark - why so?
2015-10-19T20:28:41 <colinclark> That is, your fix to the em dash
2015-10-19T20:28:43 <colinclark> NO SPACES
2015-10-19T20:28:48 <colinclark> ABSOLUTELY NO SPACES
2015-10-19T20:28:49 <Bosmon> no spaces where?
2015-10-19T20:29:13 <colinclark> between sides of the em dash
2015-10-19T20:29:27 <colinclark> unless, apparently, you work for a newspaper
2015-10-19T20:29:30 <Bosmon> Well it\'s better to have them at least the same on either side of the em-dash :)
2015-10-19T20:29:37 <Bosmon> Rather than one with and one without
2015-10-19T20:29:59 <avtar> Bosmon: if you want you could distract yourself from documentation tasks by checking out my fork and branch of fds https://github.com/avtar/first-discovery-server/tree/FLOE-423
2015-10-19T20:30:14 <Bosmon> ok, avtar
2015-10-19T20:30:14 <colinclark> Yes, you can at least claim you are following the Associated Press Style Guide, Bosmon
2015-10-19T20:30:22 <avtar> i confirmed that the changes work on linux and windows 7 hosts
2015-10-19T20:30:23 <Bosmon> Well that is something :)
2015-10-19T20:30:25 <colinclark> indeed
2015-10-19T20:30:35 <Bosmon> I\'m also happy for the spaces to be removed
2015-10-19T20:30:39 <Bosmon> As long as both of them are removed : P
2015-10-19T20:31:07 <colinclark> hahaha
2015-10-19T20:31:23 <colinclark> It\'s really not a big deal, I\'m just being silly
2015-10-19T20:31:36 <colinclark> but I will remove both spaces as part of my editorial privilege :)
2015-10-19T20:34:24 <colinclark> avtar: Did you detect any stupid mistakes in my osc.js branch related to Vagrant?
2015-10-19T20:34:46 <avtar> colinclark: just finished checking

2015-10-19T13:40:23 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks, i just misread that

2015-10-19T14:13:38 <colinclark> Bosmon: hey
2015-10-19T14:13:57 <Bosmon> Hey there colinclark
2015-10-19T14:14:42 <colinclark> So yesterday we had that edifying chat about how Node modules and Infusion IoC could be integrated
2015-10-19T14:14:47 <colinclark> which was great
2015-10-19T14:14:50 <Bosmon> Yes, we did
2015-10-19T14:15:06 <colinclark> I had initially asked about the "fluid.store" micromodule for a somewhat different reason
2015-10-19T14:15:10 <Bosmon> aha
2015-10-19T14:15:23 <colinclark> I\'m starting to look at making an "optimized" version of Bergson
2015-10-19T14:15:37 <colinclark> suitable for being integrated directly into Flocking\'s sample block generation function
2015-10-19T14:15:44 <colinclark> which runs at around 700 Hz, as you know
2015-10-19T14:16:00 <colinclark> and it immediately got me thinking about how terribly factored Flocking\'s unit generators are
2015-10-19T14:16:20 <colinclark> there\'s very little support for sharing code amongst unit generator implementations, for example
2015-10-19T14:16:27 <colinclark> which leads to a lot of duplication, etc.
2015-10-19T14:16:37 <colinclark> so just to clarify my thinking, I did some very quick sketching
2015-10-19T14:17:09 <colinclark> imagining what a tiny bit of support for "functions and state" caveperson-style programming would look like
2015-10-19T14:17:30 <colinclark> and of course it became very clear, nearly immediately, that it was a small subset of Infusion
2015-10-19T14:17:41 <colinclark> particularly fluid.defaults and the options merging system
2015-10-19T14:17:48 <Bosmon> yes
2015-10-19T14:17:54 <colinclark> perhaps some init function-style stuff from the old days
2015-10-19T14:18:14 <colinclark> I guess my question now is, how should I look at using Infusion to support this?
2015-10-19T14:18:30 <colinclark> Rather than rolling separate infrastructure for Flocking as I have in the past
2015-10-19T14:18:42 <Bosmon> Well, I guess the first answer is, by ripping off those 212 lines of code that I linked last time : P
2015-10-19T14:18:49 <Bosmon> Just before the discussion started to go off the rails
2015-10-19T14:18:53 <colinclark> Can I, for the time being, use them as is?
2015-10-19T14:19:10 <Bosmon> You could even put in some vestigial support for "invokers" too - if you were happy with fixed signatures, which you almost certainly are
2015-10-19T14:19:11 <colinclark> i.e. until I have an actual "other universe" in a worker, I can just use Infusion
2015-10-19T14:19:14 <colinclark> since it is already there
2015-10-19T14:19:26 <Bosmon> It could consume the subset of our dialect that we already support for where the argument list is not modified
2015-10-19T14:19:30 <colinclark> yeah, I\'m happy with fixed function signatures
2015-10-19T14:19:36 <Bosmon> Well, I guess "semi-fixed"
2015-10-19T14:19:46 <Bosmon> THat is, supporting references which are either {that} or {arguments}.n
2015-10-19T14:19:57 <Bosmon> Which can all both be accommodated very fast
2015-10-19T14:20:29 <Bosmon> THat would be much better than bringing back init functions
2015-10-19T14:20:39 <colinclark> interesting, yes
2015-10-19T14:20:49 <Bosmon> Then you can say that "micro-Infusion perfectly supports a profile of Infusion"
2015-10-19T14:21:04 <Bosmon> And then a bunch of Infusion configuration can be statically scanned to see if it falls in that profile or not
2015-10-19T14:21:57 <colinclark> that\'ll be quite interesting
2015-10-19T14:22:16 <Bosmon> This would basically be "Infusion without arbitrary IoC references" or indeed the notion of a "component tree" at all
2015-10-19T14:22:25 <colinclark> right
2015-10-19T14:22:47 <Bosmon> Although I guess in practice you might want the ability to instantiate subcomponents of various very simple kinds
2015-10-19T14:23:10 * anastasiac joined the channel
2015-10-19T14:23:25 <Bosmon> But no gingerness, no context resolution other than {that} or to locally available data, no distributeOptions
2015-10-19T14:23:46 <Bosmon> It\'ll basically be what Infusion 1.3 would have been had we designed it to be forwardly compatible with the Infusion we have today

2015-10-19T15:13:22 <cindyli> kasparnet, do you have some time to fork the first dicovery repos into gpii? two of them - https://github.com/fluid-project/first-discovery/, https://github.com/fluid-project/first-discovery-server/
2015-10-19T15:14:58 <cindyli> Bosmon: we want to move the first discovery server repo into gpii, can the pending pull request https://github.com/fluid-project/first-discovery-server/pull/2 go in now?
2015-10-19T15:15:25 <cindyli> if not, we can file the pull request against the gpii repo after the repo is moved
2015-10-19T15:16:15 <Bosmon> cindyli - I think we are still waiting on some fixes from avtar to enable the vagrant build to work on Windows
2015-10-19T15:16:25 <Bosmon> I guess it will be relatively easy to refile the pull
2015-10-19T15:16:41 <cindyli> ok. cool
2015-10-19T15:16:57 <cindyli> Bosmon: can you help to fork those repos into gpii?
2015-10-19T15:17:36 <kasparnet> cindyli: hey cindyli
2015-10-19T15:17:48 <kasparnet> sure, I can fork those
2015-10-19T15:18:06 <kasparnet> https://github.com/GPII/first-discovery-server
2015-10-19T15:18:10 <cindyli> thanks, kasparnet
2015-10-19T15:18:14 <Bosmon> Is it a fork?
2015-10-19T15:18:19 <avtar> cindyli: i should have the fixes ready in a couple of hours
2015-10-19T15:18:20 <Bosmon> I thought we could "transfer ownership"
2015-10-19T15:18:42 <kasparnet> Bosmon: I thought that required a fork
2015-10-19T15:18:47 <Bosmon> kasparnet: https://help.github.com/articles/transferring-a-repository/
2015-10-19T15:18:47 <cindyli> that\'s true
2015-10-19T15:19:03 <Bosmon> Read, mark, learn and inwardly digest
2015-10-19T15:19:47 <kasparnet> lol
2015-10-19T15:20:12 <cindyli> kasparnet: have u forked both repos? only see "first-discovery-server" gets forked.
2015-10-19T15:20:14 <kasparnet> ok - I guess something like this line: "The target account must not have a repository with the same name, or a fork in the same network." hints against forking
2015-10-19T15:20:23 <Bosmon> kasparnet - indeed
2015-10-19T15:21:37 <kasparnet> ok, cindyli, I\'ll delete the fork and then you\'ll have to transfer ownership from the fluid-project org to the GPII org
2015-10-19T15:21:55 <kasparnet> then I can approve once you make the transfer ownership request
2015-10-19T15:22:04 <cindyli> cool
2015-10-19T15:22:14 <kasparnet> hold on a sec though
2015-10-19T15:22:21 <kasparnet> will do the deletion of fork first
2015-10-19T15:22:24 * yzen joined the channel
2015-10-19T15:22:25 <Bosmon> I think I will need to do it
2015-10-19T15:22:36 <Bosmon> It claims that the user who does it needs to have admin rights in both orgs
2015-10-19T15:22:57 <cindyli> yay!! thanks, Bosmon
2015-10-19T15:23:41 <kasparnet> cheers, Bosmon
2015-10-19T15:23:56 <Bosmon> Is your fork deleted?
2015-10-19T15:24:27 <kasparnet> Bosmon: yup - fork is deleted
2015-10-19T15:24:27 <kasparnet> https://github.com/GPII/first-discovery-server
2015-10-19T15:26:29 <Bosmon> Looks like it is now transferred over, with pull request still in place too
2015-10-19T15:27:29 <cindyli> that\'s great
2015-10-19T15:27:29 <kasparnet> Bosmon: there is this one as well https://github.com/GPII/first-discovery
2015-10-19T15:27:30 <Bosmon> I\'ve added cindyli and Justin_o manually as collaborators, let me know if I should add anyone else
2015-10-19T15:27:37 <Bosmon> ok
2015-10-19T15:28:12 <Justin_o> Bosmon: what does that mean in terms of access rights?
2015-10-19T15:28:49 <Bosmon> Justin_o - it means that you will have push access, as far as I can see
2015-10-19T15:29:12 <Justin_o> Bosmon: cool thanks
2015-10-19T15:32:42 * alanharnum has quit
2015-10-19T15:40:30 <Bosmon> fluid-everyone - all the first-discovery repos are now transferred. I also transferred https://github.com/GPII/docs-first-discovery although it seems to be empty and has no pull requests
2015-10-19T15:40:38 * anastasiac has quit
2015-10-19T15:40:39 <Bosmon> I see that anastasiac and cindyli have forks

2015-10-19T15:47:58 <anastasiac> Bosmon, thanks for moving the docs-first-discovery repo. I\xe2\x80\x99m hoping to have a pull request for it this week :-)
2015-10-19T15:48:07 <Bosmon> anastasiac - awesome
2015-10-19T15:48:34 <cindyli> thanks for the help, Bosmon
2015-10-19T15:48:46 <Bosmon> anastasiac - in the meantime, I\'d appreciate any comments on this arriving monster pull: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/pull/77
2015-10-19T15:49:03 <anastasiac> I\xe2\x80\x99ll have a look this week, Bosmon
