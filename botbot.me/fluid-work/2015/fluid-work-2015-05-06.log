2015-05-06T14:22:24 <danaayotte> Justin_o sorry just in P4A meeting now - do you want to ping me the question and I can try to answer
2015-05-06T14:23:46 <Justin_o> danaayotte: would you be able to chat with cindyli and I over vidyo when you are finished the meeting?
2015-05-06T14:23:53 <danaayotte> for sure

2015-05-06T14:56:36 <Justin_o> cindyli, Bosmon: the FLOE-299 pull request is ready for more review. https://github.com/fluid-project/first-discovery/pull/39
2015-05-06T14:56:58 <cindyli> thanks, Justin_o
2015-05-06T14:58:08 <cindyli> Bosmon: the pull request for FLUID-5599: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/598 is also ready for another review
2015-05-06T14:58:16 <Bosmon> Thanks
2015-05-06T14:58:25 <Bosmon> Justin_o - did we decide we could remove this "liveOnly" specification? https://github.com/fluid-project/first-discovery/pull/39/files#diff-26794e4ed40159aa6d1304abaceeadb2R185
2015-05-06T15:03:56 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i tried, it didn\'t work :(
2015-05-06T15:04:30 <Bosmon> Justin_o - well, that\'s worth noting by itself : P
2015-05-06T15:04:32 <Bosmon> How didn\'t it work?
2015-05-06T15:04:59 <Justin_o> Bosmon: hmm one second i have to try again, i made a bunch of changes afterwards so can\'t quite remember
2015-05-06T15:08:09 <Justin_o> Bosmon: hmm.. perhaps my other changes fixed the problem i was seeing.. it seems to work now with that removed
2015-05-06T15:08:14 <Bosmon> cool
2015-05-06T15:08:20 <Justin_o> i\'ll see if i can simplify it
2015-05-06T15:11:15 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i\'ve removed that, and used the simplified syntax for the model relay
2015-05-06T15:13:11 <danaayotte> Justin_o cindyli: talk now?
2015-05-06T15:13:19 <Justin_o> danaayotte: sure
2015-05-06T15:13:21 <cindyli> sure
2015-05-06T15:13:45 <Justin_o> danaayotte, cindyli: you can join my room
2015-05-06T15:13:50 <cindyli> sure
2015-05-06T15:14:20 <danaayotte> looks like it\'s locked Justin_o
2015-05-06T15:14:37 <Justin_o> cindy is in
2015-05-06T15:14:40 <Justin_o> did you want to try again?
2015-05-06T15:15:10 <danaayotte> can you invite me Justin_o

2015-05-06T16:22:59 <jhernandez> avtar: sorry, saw your ping this morning
2015-05-06T16:23:58 <jhernandez> I left a comment for you here https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/327#issuecomment-99408731
2015-05-06T16:24:26 <avtar> jhernandez: no worries

2015-05-06T16:29:28 <avtar> jhernandez: kasper was making changes to his fork of universal during review3
2015-05-06T16:29:36 <avtar> https://github.com/kaspermarkus/universal/tree/review3
2015-05-06T16:30:35 <avtar> that branch has the Dockerfile living with universal as opposed to a separate repo like the gpii-ops/docker-universal one
2015-05-06T16:30:50 <jhernandez> yup
2015-05-06T16:31:31 <jhernandez> in fact, we have a review3 branch of GPII/universal
2015-05-06T16:31:33 <jhernandez> https://github.com/GPII/universal/tree/review3
2015-05-06T16:31:45 <avtar> i would vote for following that approach in gpii/universal
2015-05-06T16:32:42 <jhernandez> sorry, I\'ve got lost
2015-05-06T16:33:09 <colinclark> avtar: Is it safe to assume that you\'ll, at some point, migrate our PiratePad for the P4A QI plan into the wiki? http://piratepad.net/kAn01WV3Gl
2015-05-06T16:33:14 <jhernandez> by "that approach" do you mean having the dockerfile in certain branches?
2015-05-06T16:33:16 <colinclark> so that we don\'t lose our Phase 1 plan?
2015-05-06T16:33:45 <avtar> colinclark: yes
2015-05-06T16:33:50 <colinclark> thanks!
2015-05-06T16:34:49 <avtar> jhernandez: i meant having the dockerfile in the master branch
2015-05-06T16:35:21 * michelled has quit
2015-05-06T16:37:07 <avtar> i can add some details to https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/README.md as well
2015-05-06T16:37:27 <jhernandez> avtar: ok, got it
2015-05-06T16:38:26 <jhernandez> and yeah, it would be great to add some details in our README file (if you have time)
2015-05-06T16:40:02 <avtar> i should also mention that as part of the p4a quality infra work we\'ll be revisiting how container image builds and testing info is specified in project repositories (like gpii\'s universal), something along the lines of how travis does it https://github.com/travis-ci-examples/node.js/blob/master/.travis.yml
2015-05-06T16:40:41 <avtar> but i\'ll open a separate pull request for that when we\'re ready along with updated docs :)
2015-05-06T16:42:37 <avtar> brb
2015-05-06T16:44:18 <jhernandez> avtar: no prob, I\'m about to leave
2015-05-06T16:45:08 <jhernandez> so in resume, you\'ll provide us with some very basic literature with references in our README.md as a separate pull request
2015-05-06T16:46:58 <jhernandez> just confirm to me whether you think that it\'s worth to merge ASAP or not, and that if the literature can wait a little bit more

2015-05-06T17:45:39 <cindyli> Bosmon: i\'m having an interesting problem with locale
2015-05-06T17:46:25 <cindyli> basically i\'m using my latest branch in the first discovery tool. the issue seems from the initial default value "en" for defaultLocale in fluid.prefs.prefsEditorLoader
2015-05-06T17:46:49 <Bosmon> Hi cindyli
2015-05-06T17:47:02 <cindyli> in the case that locale and defaultLocale have the same value "en", all rendering fails
2015-05-06T17:47:16 <cindyli> if they have different values, things work fine
2015-05-06T17:47:51 <cindyli> well, incomplete sentence: "using my latest branch for FLUID-5599"
2015-05-06T17:48:50 <cindyli> of course, if we don\'t set the default value for defalutLocale, things will work but of course that\'s just to hide the bug
2015-05-06T17:50:11 <cindyli> Bosmon: if you wanna see this issue, here\'s the first discovery branch - https://github.com/cindyli/first-discovery/tree/FLOE-314
2015-05-06T17:50:33 <cindyli> when the rendering faiils, the loading of templates and message bundles are completely fine
2015-05-06T17:50:54 <Bosmon> cindyli - seems odd
2015-05-06T17:51:01 <cindyli> agree
2015-05-06T17:51:11 <Bosmon> I\'ve just added a unit test to cover this, but I don\'t see a problem
2015-05-06T17:51:17 <Bosmon> Ok, I\'ll check out your branch
2015-05-06T17:53:10 <cindyli> thanks, Bosmon, you will see the failure by directly runing demos/index.html. to see things being rendered, change this line https://github.com/cindyli/first-discovery/blob/FLOE-314/src/schemas/schemas.js#L117 to "default": "fr"
2015-05-06T17:53:38 <Bosmon> Thanks, cindyli
2015-05-06T17:53:48 <cindyli> thank YOU, Bosmon!
2015-05-06T17:57:47 <Bosmon> cindyli - ok.... it appears that the fetchResources call for the loader never returns
2015-05-06T18:01:26 <cindyli> did you find out what\'s causing it, Bosmon
2015-05-06T18:01:45 <cindyli> oh, the loader. checking...
2015-05-06T18:02:30 * michelled has left the channel
2015-05-06T18:03:06 <Bosmon> Well, a bug is causing it :)
2015-05-06T18:03:11 <cindyli> the loader looks fine
2015-05-06T18:03:16 <Bosmon> It\'s fine
2015-05-06T18:03:27 <Bosmon> Nonetheless, the fetchResources call is not firing
2015-05-06T18:09:06 <Bosmon> cindyli - ok, I can reproduce the issue in a test case
2015-05-06T18:09:20 <Bosmon> It results from specifying forceCache with the two URLs the same
2015-05-06T18:13:49 <cindyli> ah ha. great you found it!

2015-05-06T18:34:44 <cindyli1> that\'s fast. thanks, Bosmon. trying out
2015-05-06T18:39:30 <cindyli1> Bosmon: in ur pull request, does tests/framework-tests/core/html/FluidRequests-test.html pass? it hangs for me at "Localisation Tests"

2015-05-06T18:40:04 <Bosmon> oh
2015-05-06T18:40:05 <Bosmon> damn
2015-05-06T18:40:06 <Bosmon> Sory
2015-05-06T18:40:38 <cindyli1> np, for loading ../data/messages4_en.json
2015-05-06T18:41:17 <Bosmon> cindyli1 - pull updated now
2015-05-06T18:41:21 <cindyli1> sure
2015-05-06T18:46:12 <cindyli1> Bosmon: your pull request works perfectly!!
2015-05-06T18:46:19 <cindyli1> thanks
2015-05-06T18:47:02 <Bosmon> cindyli1 - np.... sorry that this terrible code is still lying around from 2009
2015-05-06T18:47:17 <Bosmon> It really doesn\'t do anything useful
2015-05-06T18:47:37 * avtar joined the channel
2015-05-06T18:47:44 <Bosmon> Really, the simplest thing would just have been to eliminate "forceCache" entirely since it isn\'t doing any good at all in any of our current projects
2015-05-06T18:47:56 <Bosmon> But it seemed best to fix the code before it is all swept away
2015-05-06T18:48:18 <cindyli1> we\'ll get there gradually ;)

2015-05-06T19:43:46 <cindyli> also, Bosmon, my pull request for FLUID-5599 (https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/598) is up to date and ready for another look
