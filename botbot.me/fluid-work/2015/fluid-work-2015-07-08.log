2015-07-08T18:11:56 <colinclark> apparently someone from this company wants to have a hyper-converged coffee with avtar this week
2015-07-08T18:12:22 <alanharnum> i\'m jealous
2015-07-08T18:12:32 <colinclark> no no
2015-07-08T18:12:33 <alanharnum> i\'ve been interested in hyper-convergence for like literally years
2015-07-08T18:12:34 <colinclark> you\'re invited!
2015-07-08T18:12:40 <alanharnum> is it going to help us synergize new paradigms?
2015-07-08T18:12:47 <colinclark> you can hyper-converge WITH avtar
2015-07-08T18:13:05 <alanharnum> alas i am hyper-converging in whitby thursday and friday
2015-07-08T18:13:08 <colinclark> oh yes
2015-07-08T18:13:10 <colinclark> yes yes
2015-07-08T18:13:11 <colinclark> sorry
2015-07-08T18:13:35 <alanharnum> "turnkey appliance" sounds like a great replacement for Nebula!
2015-07-08T18:13:38 <colinclark> indeed
2015-07-08T18:13:45 <colinclark> if only we can figure out how to pronounce their company\'s name
2015-07-08T18:13:51 <alanharnum> "Breakwater"
2015-07-08T18:14:04 <colinclark> Bosmon could probably pronounce it really good
2015-07-08T18:14:47 <alanharnum> you guys have seen http://tiffzhang.com/startup/ right?
2015-07-08T18:14:50 <Bosmon> Justin_o will be further interested in the connection between Whitby and 666 :)
2015-07-08T18:15:03 <Justin_o> lol
2015-07-08T18:18:23 <gtirloni> colinclark, have they cold called avtar?
2015-07-08T18:20:57 <gtirloni> their pitch: https://angel.co/breqwatr/deck
2015-07-08T18:25:02 <colinclark> this is their founder\'s third company
2015-07-08T18:25:33 <colinclark> gtirloni: I think our vendor referred them to avtar
2015-07-08T18:25:35 <colinclark> but I\'m not certain
2015-07-08T18:25:54 <gtirloni> they look exactly like nebula, even use arista.. i wonder what they think it\'s different about them
2015-07-08T18:26:03 <colinclark> yep, exactly
2015-07-08T18:26:21 <colinclark> or how they intend to stay in business past their current round of VC

2015-07-08T19:05:12 <cindyli1> jhung: in terms of showing/hiding side bar for doc-base, when users switch to another html page, should the previous selection be persistent?
2015-07-08T19:06:10 <cindyli1> or go back to the whatever initial state?
2015-07-08T19:07:05 <jhung> what do you mean previous selection cindyli1? Do you mean does it stay closed / open if you\'re moving to a different page?
2015-07-08T19:07:18 <cindyli1> yes, jhung
2015-07-08T19:07:48 <jhung> The sidebar should maintain its state within the session cindyli1.
2015-07-08T19:07:55 <cindyli1> ok, jhung
2015-07-08T19:08:00 <jhung> thanks!
2015-07-08T19:08:38 <cindyli1> np
2015-07-08T19:11:50 <Justin_o> cindyli1: I think some of our UIO docs are out of date. Did you update them with the change for the template and message prefixes?
2015-07-08T19:13:44 <cindyli1> Justin_o: the docs are updated with the new introduction of "terms" block. other than that, I\'m not aware of other changes for the template and message prefixes

2015-07-08T20:18:45 <Bosmon> Working sample of the PPIG example application: https://github.com/amb26/papers/tree/master/ppig-2015/example
2015-07-08T20:19:15 <Bosmon> Note that the view code here doesn\'t resemble that in the paper, since the only working standalone data binding system that we have is the one written recently by the-t-in-rtf
2015-07-08T20:19:26 <Bosmon> So I lashed that together with a modified version of the view grades in order to make the sample work
2015-07-08T20:20:04 <Bosmon> alanharnum pasted - "sequential intention considered harmful!" which is completely true
2015-07-08T20:20:34 <Bosmon> But we have recently incarnated an even more extreme version of the slogan - "computation considered harmful!" : P

2015-07-08T20:27:25 <alanharnum> I am informed that "Rich lemon defrauds" is a suggested anagram of "Consider harmful".
2015-07-08T20:27:43 <alanharnum> I think "rich lemon defrauds" describes many of my experiences working with systems, so seems appropriate.

2015-07-08T20:36:10 * yzen has quit
2015-07-08T20:37:15 <colinclark> One gets the distinct sense that Karma isn\'t really set up to easily support what we want to do...
2015-07-08T20:37:28 <colinclark> i.e. to have an ordinary HTML test file that can simply be run in a browser
2015-07-08T20:37:32 <colinclark> and then also run that using Karma
2015-07-08T20:38:30 <colinclark> I haven\'t yet read its documentation, but I have this impression that it thinks its job is to synthesize an HTML from pointers to dependencies and a "javascript test file"

2015-07-08T21:37:48 <colinclark> avtar: this one is barely comprehensible, but I think also illustrates the problem https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/karma-users/Bae1BAGAe00
2015-07-08T21:38:26 <colinclark> And this seals the deal: https://github.com/karma-runner/karma-qunit/issues/18
2015-07-08T21:39:08 <colinclark> It\'s clear there\'s simply no way to integrate Karma with a standard QUnit workflow
2015-07-08T21:39:16 <colinclark> thus many of the Infusion tests will never pass
2015-07-08T21:39:25 <colinclark> since the rely on the fact that there are actually elements in the DOM
2015-07-08T21:40:14 <colinclark> and on QUnit\'s feature of cleaning up and reinjecting the qunit-fixture element
2015-07-08T21:40:27 <colinclark> And the Karma author\'s response to all this is to say
2015-07-08T21:40:28 <colinclark> "Well just create the DOM element."
2015-07-08T21:42:51 <colinclark> I\'m bummed out
2015-07-08T21:43:51 <colinclark> Is there anything interesting in https://www.npmjs.com/package/testee ?

2015-07-08T16:37:03 <colinclark> you
2015-07-08T16:37:09 <avtar> Bosmon, slim: https://conf.inclusivedesign.ca/flex.html?roomdirect.html&key=rkSs1zg5mxxnMMcppnBLaWAl2o
2015-07-08T16:37:09 <slim> :)
2015-07-08T16:37:30 <colinclark> slim: In terms of your question on the tiger team list...
2015-07-08T16:37:35 <colinclark> we don\'t have any requirement to rebase pull requests
2015-07-08T16:37:45 <slim> is that going to be the same every week? I could change the calendar
2015-07-08T16:37:49 <colinclark> but in general, we recommend that pull requests not contain commits that are spurious
2015-07-08T16:37:56 <colinclark> slim: We have no plans to change
2015-07-08T16:38:01 <colinclark> unless GTM continues to be broken
2015-07-08T16:38:05 <slim> cool! All my commits are spurious :)
2015-07-08T16:38:37 <slim> Perhas GTM went way of American Airlines and stock exchange
2015-07-08T16:38:46 <Bosmon> Vidyo seems very little better
2015-07-08T16:38:52 <slim> Connecting, please wait...
2015-07-08T16:38:58 <Bosmon> Connecting is extremely flaky
2015-07-08T16:39:04 <Bosmon> I got a few seconds of audio from Simon
2015-07-08T16:39:07 <Bosmon> And then the call dropped
2015-07-08T16:39:11 <Bosmon> Same again a 2nd time now
2015-07-08T16:39:34 <slim> no connection for me :(
2015-07-08T16:39:49 <Bosmon> Now I got "General error: try again"
2015-07-08T16:39:55 <Bosmon> Also sgithens has never used Vidyo
2015-07-08T16:39:59 <Bosmon> Any chance we can move the meeting to Skype?
2015-07-08T16:40:02 <colinclark> no
2015-07-08T16:40:02 <clown> dang those general errors...
2015-07-08T16:40:13 <colinclark> it\'s too late Bosmon and we\'re in the middle of discussions
2015-07-08T16:40:21 <Bosmon> ok, no problem
2015-07-08T16:40:23 <slim> bloody vidyo keeps grabbing focus as I type
2015-07-08T16:40:34 <slim> guys - carry on without me -
2015-07-08T16:40:40 <slim> good luck Bosman
2015-07-08T16:40:53 <colinclark> Bosmon: sgithens______ should have no problem clicking avtar\'s link above
2015-07-08T16:41:01 <colinclark> and use the web client if he doesn\'t want to install the native client
2015-07-08T16:41:07 <colinclark> as for you, i\'m not sure what\'s up
2015-07-08T16:41:36 <slim> the only thing I found with web was no chant but thts not a problem for you as using IRC
2015-07-08T16:41:47 <colinclark> NO CHANTING ALLOWED
