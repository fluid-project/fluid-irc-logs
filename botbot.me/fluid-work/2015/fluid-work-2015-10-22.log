2015-10-22T14:40:38 <slim_> well, knock me down with a feather - http://blogs.msdn.com/b/powershell/archive/2015/10/19/openssh-for-windows-update.aspx
2015-10-22T14:41:28 <alanharnum> slim_: interesting
2015-10-22T14:41:46 <alanharnum> not a lot of details but i\'m wondering if this is a first step towards making Windows better compatible with modern CI tools
2015-10-22T14:41:52 <slim_> Yeah, and it\'s on git hub.
2015-10-22T14:42:02 <slim_> alanharnum: almost certainly!
2015-10-22T14:42:58 <slim_> as long as you use Azure :)
2015-10-22T14:44:27 <slim_> alanharnum:  little more here from Scott  http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ItsHappeningOpenSSHForWindowsfromMicrosoft.aspx
2015-10-22T14:44:51 <alanharnum> "Given our changes in leadership and culture, we decided to give it another try and this time, because we are able to show the clear and compelling customer value, the company is very supportive."
2015-10-22T14:45:05 <slim_> alanharnum: heh
2015-10-22T14:45:17 <alanharnum> translation: once Balmer evacuated and the VP who ran their only really successful cloud offering was put in charge
2015-10-22T14:45:43 <slim_> +1
2015-10-22T14:46:25 <slim_> talking of CI I just got a copy of the Continuous Delivery book. It\'s great but a long read ahead

2015-10-22T14:49:22 <slim_> alanharnum: oops, forgot the link. The Thoughtworks one - http://www.amazon.co.uk/Continuous-Delivery-Deployment-Automation-Addison-Wesley/dp/0321601912/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1445525207&sr=8-1&keywords=continuous+delivery

2015-10-22T14:52:14 <alanharnum> slim_: oh yeah, great book
2015-10-22T14:53:19 <alanharnum> http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030355.do is really interesting as well (also by Jez Humble) - more about the organizational culture side and structuring of working that way, but great on the human factors side of a CD approach

2015-10-22T14:55:03 <alanharnum> the regular O\'Reilly ebook sales are my kryptonite
2015-10-22T14:55:19 <alanharnum> not even getting into being able to get stuff free off Safari Bookshelf :P
