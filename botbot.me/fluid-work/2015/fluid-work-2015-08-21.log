2015-08-21T00:43:23 <gtirloni> jira is back, now running on the new server..
2015-08-21T00:47:05 <Bosmon> Cheers, gtirloni
2015-08-21T00:47:14 <Bosmon> Looks like there is some form of HTTPS certificate problem
2015-08-21T00:48:19 <Bosmon> "Mismatched URL scheme" notification on the dashboard
2015-08-21T00:52:46 <gtirloni> hmm let me check this
2015-08-21T00:53:05 <Bosmon> When I try to edit an issue I then get a "Communications Breakdown
2015-08-21T00:53:06 <Bosmon> The JIRA server could not be contacted. This may be a temporary glitch or the server may be down.
2015-08-21T00:53:06 <Bosmon> Close this dialog and press refresh in your browser"
2015-08-21T00:53:59 <gtirloni> it works here.. I forced a cache cleanup on the server side and, by habit, cleaned my local cache too
2015-08-21T00:54:15 <gtirloni> what JIRA are you trying to edit?
2015-08-21T00:54:27 <Bosmon> https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-4336
2015-08-21T00:54:51 <gtirloni> can you see my comment there?
2015-08-21T00:55:03 <Bosmon> yes
2015-08-21T00:56:45 <Bosmon> Do you not see the "potential problem" message on the dashboard?
2015-08-21T00:56:51 <Bosmon> https://issues.fluidproject.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa
2015-08-21T00:58:14 <Bosmon> I tried it in Firefox and it is even worse
2015-08-21T00:58:17 <gtirloni> I saw it the first time I started JIRA ... it had a "dot" at the end of the url.. but i asked it update it
2015-08-21T00:58:26 <gtirloni> i\'m using firefox 40 only here
2015-08-21T00:58:58 <gtirloni> did you use to get good performance out of jira 5.2? it was always sluggish for me
2015-08-21T00:59:07 <Bosmon> It wasn\'t brilliant
2015-08-21T00:59:44 <Bosmon> On Firefox I get a bizarre notification that the site is trying to operate a Java plugin
2015-08-21T01:00:03 <gtirloni> now i see the url mismatch warning after i logged out.. hmm..
2015-08-21T01:00:20 <Bosmon> I also get the "Communications Breakdown" issue when trying to edit the issue in Firefox
2015-08-21T01:00:29 <Bosmon> It all seems seriously buggered
2015-08-21T01:01:03 <Bosmon> I get an "Insecure content" warning in both browsers
2015-08-21T01:01:11 <Bosmon> Lots of content in the page is trying to be served over plain HTTP
2015-08-21T01:01:34 <gtirloni> okay, i know what that might be. one sec
2015-08-21T01:02:54 <Bosmon> I also get a 401 going by on this URL: https://issues.fluidproject.org/rest/hipchat/integrations/1.0/configuration/status?_=1440118940593
2015-08-21T01:02:57 <Bosmon> No idea what "hipchat" is : P
2015-08-21T01:03:12 <gtirloni> it\'s atlassian\'s chat product, much like Slack, etc.
2015-08-21T01:03:18 <gtirloni> we don\'t have that
2015-08-21T01:05:26 <Bosmon> So it looks like there really is some Java on the page....
2015-08-21T01:05:32 <Bosmon> The top element of the document is this: <embed hidden="true" type="application/java-deployment-toolkit" id="deployJavaPlugin">
2015-08-21T01:41:47 <gtirloni> the http/https issues should be solved now
2015-08-21T01:41:57 <Bosmon> Hey yes gtirloni - looking much better
2015-08-21T01:42:59 <gtirloni> with confluence, i can run it in http mode and put nginx in front of it.. terminating TLS at nginx
2015-08-21T01:43:08 <Bosmon> The "communications failure" problem has gone away too
2015-08-21T01:43:11 <gtirloni> the same should work with jira.. but it doesn\'t
2015-08-21T01:43:37 <gtirloni> with jira 5.2 i had to run jira in https mode, otherwise it would be using http url\'s in one place, https in other places..
2015-08-21T01:43:49 <gtirloni> it seems this has not been solved :/ i\'ll open a request with atlassian
2015-08-21T01:44:07 <gtirloni> it\'s a bit wasteful to run jira in https, then also terminate TLS at nginx..
2015-08-21T01:44:20 <gtirloni> i\'ll perform re-index now
2015-08-21T01:45:06 <gtirloni> also, all the hipchat stuff should be gone :)
2015-08-21T01:45:51 <Bosmon> awesome
2015-08-21T01:45:58 <Bosmon> THanks for beavering away on this late into the night, gtirloni
2015-08-21T01:46:17 <gtirloni> thank you for helping test the beast!!!
2015-08-21T01:46:29 <gtirloni> it\'s much later for you than for me, 22:46 here :)
2015-08-21T01:48:21 <gtirloni> re-indexing done too
2015-08-21T02:06:32 <Bosmon> Yes
2015-08-21T02:06:38 <Bosmon> Seems significantly more snappy now

2015-08-21T13:32:05 <simonjb> Bosmon, would you have any time for a GPII/infusion design question?
2015-08-21T13:35:02 * anvk joined the channel
2015-08-21T13:44:31 <Bosmon> Sure, simonjb
2015-08-21T13:46:43 <simonjb> great, thanks Bosmon; I\'m wondering what the best way is to retrieve the user privacy settings for the hybrid flow manager; like for our oauth2 endpoint, I\'m extending gpii.request.flowManager.matchMakingRequest
2015-08-21T13:48:17 <simonjb> for the oauth2 endpoint, we retieve the selectedPreferences right at the start and then fire off events for userToken and deviceContext https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/src/CloudBasedFlowManager.js#L234-L249
2015-08-21T13:50:12 <simonjb> I can also follow the approach, but I\'m thinking that in the future, once we have couchdb, the retrieval of privacy settings will be async and so I\'m wondering if another approach would be to use an event for privacySettingsReady or such and extend the required events for match making as defined in https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/src/FlowManager
2015-08-21T13:50:12 <simonjb> Utilities.js#L142-L154
2015-08-21T13:51:00 <Bosmon> simonjb - yes, that\'s perfectly reasonable
2015-08-21T13:51:13 <Bosmon> To extend the "boiled event set" that onReadyToMatch depends on
2015-08-21T13:52:01 <simonjb> Bosmon: what is the notation for doing that?
2015-08-21T13:52:13 <Bosmon> simonjb - that is what you see right there
2015-08-21T13:52:32 <Bosmon> Curretnly onReadyToMatch is a boiled event which depends on 3 base events
2015-08-21T13:52:38 <simonjb> Bosmon: do I override the whole event spec?
2015-08-21T13:52:44 <Bosmon> And you will add a 4th
2015-08-21T13:52:56 <simonjb> that is duplicate what is there and add my 4th?
2015-08-21T13:52:58 <Bosmon> simonjb - I\'d just rewrite it
2015-08-21T13:53:09 <Bosmon> I imagine we\'ll always want to have some kind of privacy filtering stage
2015-08-21T13:53:16 <Bosmon> Even if in some situations it is just a noop
2015-08-21T13:53:46 <Bosmon> Unless you find that there are other things in matchMakingRequest that you need to factor off
2015-08-21T13:53:51 <simonjb> Bosmon: so add ready to do privacy filtering into the base
2015-08-21T13:54:07 <Bosmon> simonjb - if that makes sense dependency-wise, yes
2015-08-21T13:54:21 <Bosmon> I think it does, doesn\'t it
2015-08-21T13:54:25 <simonjb> modify gpii.request.flowManager.matchMakingRequest?
2015-08-21T13:54:39 <Bosmon> It\'s just that the workflow after onReadyToMatch that is different in the hybrid case
2015-08-21T13:54:42 <Bosmon> Is that right?
2015-08-21T13:57:23 <simonjb> Bosmon: yes, here\'s what it currently looks like (with hardcoded privacy settings "selectedPreferencesMap")
2015-08-21T13:57:28 <simonjb> https://github.com/simonbates/universal/blob/GPII-1224/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/src/CloudBasedFlowManager.js#L125-L166
2015-08-21T13:58:21 <Bosmon> simonjb - cool
2015-08-21T13:58:59 <Bosmon> Oddly I was having a conversation about a similar issue with colinclark a couple of days ago, re what you could call "inheritance"
2015-08-21T13:59:21 <Bosmon> Since he had some code in "bergson" which got broken by the "arabic grade fix" that was merged yesterday... or rather which required the fix
2015-08-21T13:59:47 <Bosmon> Relating to a "partially factored design" vs a "completely factored design"
2015-08-21T14:00:01 * clown joined the channel
2015-08-21T14:00:02 <Bosmon> So you could say that in a "completely factored design", there is never any overriding
2015-08-21T14:00:27 <Bosmon> In that as soon as there is more than one implementation for an operation, you make that operation abstract and push all of the implementations out into subgrades
2015-08-21T14:00:40 <simonjb> and compose?
2015-08-21T14:01:01 <Bosmon> But of course OO, and also Infusion itself, offer support for "partially factored designs" where you imagine that there is a "base behaviour" which makes sense in itself, and you then derive from the base and override it
2015-08-21T14:01:10 <simonjb> or you mean each subgrade fills in its specialization
2015-08-21T14:01:13 <Bosmon> So you could say that what is developing in matchMakingRequest is one of those situations
2015-08-21T14:01:38 <Bosmon> It\'s perfectly reasonable to just override the listener which occurs on this line: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/src/FlowManagerUtilities.js#L163
2015-08-21T14:01:49 <Bosmon> To express the fact that you are processing matchMaking remotely rather than locally
2015-08-21T14:02:10 <Bosmon> And there are always costs to i) the factoring itself, and ii) having one more artefact in the system than you did previously
2015-08-21T14:02:28 <Bosmon> So it\'s always completely arguable when the design tensions involved recommend that you move towards a more full factoring
2015-08-21T14:02:56 <simonjb> what are your thoughts in this case?
2015-08-21T14:03:36 <Bosmon> But you could say that in theory now, matchMakingRequest is ripe for being factored into 3 .... something like a "matchMakingRequisites" base grade, and then a "localMatchMakingRequest" and "remoteMatchMakingRequest" derived grades
2015-08-21T14:04:00 <Bosmon> matchMakingRequisites then becomes abstract in that it can\'t completely process a request any more - but then it never really could completely process one
2015-08-21T14:04:25 <Bosmon> simonjb - well personally I always like to factor things :)
2015-08-21T14:04:33 <Bosmon> But often these isn\'t always time
2015-08-21T14:05:22 <Bosmon> My feeling that in this case is that it would be worthwhile in clarifying the design, and not be terribly expensive
2015-08-21T14:05:27 <Bosmon> But it would also be perfectly reasonable not to do it
2015-08-21T14:05:33 <simonjb> in terms of local vs remote, https://github.com/simonbates/universal/blob/GPII-1224/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/src/CloudBasedFlowManager.js#L125-L166 is the remote side
2015-08-21T14:06:10 <Bosmon> simonjb - cool
2015-08-21T14:06:33 <Bosmon> So yes, our only point of contact is the processMatch listener
2015-08-21T14:07:05 <Bosmon> Well, on the remote side, yes
2015-08-21T14:07:28 <simonjb> yes
2015-08-21T14:07:36 <simonjb> this is the local side: https://github.com/simonbates/universal/blob/GPII-1224/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/src/UntrustedFlowManager.js

2015-08-21T14:09:55 <Bosmon> simonjb - ok then, it looks like we indeed do have a useful refactoring opportunity here
2015-08-21T14:10:09 <Bosmon> Since your local side shares a fair amount of material with the original UserLogin request
2015-08-21T14:10:17 <Bosmon> https://github.com/simonbates/universal/blob/GPII-1224/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/src/UserLogin.js#L58
2015-08-21T14:10:48 <Bosmon> Wow, I just finished a GIANT cup of tea without even realising it : P
2015-08-21T14:11:31 <simonjb> Bosmon: yes, agreed
2015-08-21T14:12:02 <simonjb> Bosmon: ok, so a good avenue of exploration looks like refactoring gpii.request.flowManager.matchMakingRequest
2015-08-21T14:12:47 <Bosmon> simonjb - yes, in conjunction with refactoring "kettle.requests.request.handler.userLogin"
2015-08-21T14:12:51 <simonjb> to be used for 1) existing local login 2) hybrid local login 3) cloud based flow 4) remote hybrid cloud based flow
2015-08-21T14:13:03 <Bosmon> You\'ll be glad to know that this silly name has been abolished in NEW KETTLE : P
2015-08-21T14:14:12 <simonjb> thanks Bosmon, I will start on some refactoring now
2015-08-21T14:14:21 <Bosmon> simonjb - that\'s awesome, thanks for that!
