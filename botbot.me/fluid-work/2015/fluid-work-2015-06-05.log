2015-06-05T20:02:10 <Justin_o> simonjb: thanks
2015-06-05T20:02:15 <Justin_o> for filing that..
2015-06-05T20:02:19 <Justin_o> it's rather unfortunate
2015-06-05T20:02:29 <Justin_o> anastasiac: how do you think that will affect our demos
2015-06-05T20:03:05 <anastasiac> Justin_o, I\xe2\x80\x99m not worried about it. We never planned for these two \xe2\x80\x98context\xe2\x80\x99 demos to be something we hand to the participants to play we. We will do a quick demo, that\xe2\x80\x99s it
2015-06-05T20:03:16 <anastasiac> We should clean them up
2015-06-05T20:03:28 <anastasiac> but not urgently for the workshop
2015-06-05T20:37:39 <jhung> anastasiac, Justin_o, simonjb, cindyli - I'm heading off. If there are any fires to put out, send an email and I can help on Monday.
2015-06-05T20:38:00 <simonjb> have a great weekend jhung

2015-06-05T20:46:27 <anastasiac> ?
2015-06-05T20:46:56 <Jess_> anastasiac: yes, i RSVP\xe2\x80\x99d to Leah earlier
2015-06-05T20:47:18 <anastasiac> ok, so if we don\xe2\x80\x99t see you before then, at least we\xe2\x80\x99ll see you then
2015-06-05T20:47:40 <Jess_> you betcha
2015-06-05T20:47:48 <Jess_> Justin_o: anastasiac: have fun walking the mall!

2015-06-05T21:11:33 <Jess_> anastasiac: would be cool if we had something that whet their appetite for what was to come throughout the day
2015-06-05T21:11:40 <Jess_> something that shows a glimpse of what they\xe2\x80\x99ll see
2015-06-05T21:11:43 <Jess_> what do you think?
2015-06-05T21:12:09 <anastasiac> Jess_: what kind of think were you thinking? screenshots? the session is immediately before the breakout, no?
2015-06-05T21:12:22 <Jess_> screenshots
2015-06-05T21:12:26 <Jess_> just glimpses
2015-06-05T21:12:53 <Jess_> page 8 seems small
2015-06-05T21:12:55 <Jess_> but we\xe2\x80\x99ve done so much!
2015-06-05T21:13:12 <Jess_> slide 9 let\xe2\x80\x99s also beef it up with next steps?
2015-06-05T21:13:23 <Jess_> and contextualization?
2015-06-05T21:13:27 <anastasiac> maybe we can just say we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to spoil it by showing them things in advance
2015-06-05T21:13:28 <Jess_> and integration
2015-06-05T21:13:34 <Jess_> that\xe2\x80\x99s fine
2015-06-05T21:13:43 <Jess_> i\xe2\x80\x99m also a fan of keep it simple
2015-06-05T21:14:24 <anastasiac> I\xe2\x80\x99ll add another slide for next steps. slide 9 is about the actual day of the workshop, only
2015-06-05T21:14:33 <Jess_> ok
2015-06-05T21:14:46 <Jess_> well, we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about integration so maybe add that to slide 8?
2015-06-05T21:14:51 <Jess_> i don\xe2\x80\x99t think it matters much
2015-06-05T21:15:02 <Jess_> we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be talking through them \xe2\x80\x94 so the slides don\xe2\x80\x99t have to say everything
2015-06-05T21:15:15 <anastasiac> 8 is about what we\xe2\x80\x99ve created already

2015-06-05T12:58:42 <Justin_o> i also have some tablets here if you want to test on those after the desktop
2015-06-05T12:58:59 <Justin_o> i don\'t think the tablets are high priority right now, but it\'d probably be good to surface the issues in jiras

2015-06-05T14:49:42 <jhung> michelled: not really. I had some free time yesterday so I got started on some documentation.
2015-06-05T14:50:57 <michelled> ah, cool
2015-06-05T14:52:36 <michelled> jhung: can you start drafting new sections for the ILDH based on the work you\'ve done with PhET since the last time we updated ILDH?
2015-06-05T14:52:44 <michelled> when you have time, of course
2015-06-05T14:52:49 <michelled> it needs to be there for July
2015-06-05T14:53:25 <michelled> it might just be updating the epub 3 section and talking about ideas around sonification
2015-06-05T14:53:49 <michelled> it might be worth doing it in the wiki first, and then getting some community feedback before putting it into the ILDH
2015-06-05T14:54:54 <jhung> michelled: sounds good. I suspect this will be a new section apart from EPUB since it\'s more about making inclusive simulations. EPUB is just one of the delivery formats.
2015-06-05T14:57:53 <michelled> sounds good

2015-06-05T17:11:23 <simonjb> will do, thanks Justin_o
2015-06-05T17:11:23 <jhung> ok Justin_o. I will file one for the issue I found on Android.
2015-06-05T17:11:24 <anastasiac> yay!!
2015-06-05T17:11:34 <Justin_o> jhung: thanks
2015-06-05T17:21:47 <jhung> Justin_o, anastasiac: Would you consider this a blocker? https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLOE-384?src=confmacro
2015-06-05T17:22:20 <anastasiac> jhung, is this present in all version of the tool? or only the voting demo?
2015-06-05T17:22:30 <jhung> voting anastasiac
2015-06-05T17:22:57 <anastasiac> then I\xe2\x80\x99d say no, not a blocker. That demo is not really intended for the workshop participants to actually play with. They might, but...

2015-06-05T17:37:02 <jhung> Justin_o - in Safari in Voting demo, I can\'t seem to click the "Settings" link at the end. Can you?
2015-06-05T17:41:30 <jhung> Also, it looks like the icons for the community links on the fluid build site are no longer being centered. Could it be that whoever added the FD links accidentally modified something else?
2015-06-05T17:44:24 <jhung> Justin_o: ignore my comment about the Settings link not working. For some reason by having the Inspector open I couldn\'t click the link. It seems to be working now.
2015-06-05T17:45:02 <Justin_o> jhung: that\'s strange
2015-06-05T17:45:08 <Justin_o> maybe there was a break point or something

2015-06-05T17:46:48 <Justin_o> jhung: yah, we only have full translations for english and spanish
2015-06-05T17:46:52 <jhung> ok. thanks. Just checking anastasiac
2015-06-05T17:47:08 <anastasiac> jhung, the tool should fall back to english. If it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t, let us know!
2015-06-05T17:47:31 <jhung> yeah. it falls back on English. All good anastasiac.
