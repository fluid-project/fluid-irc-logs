2015-08-31T14:01:49 <cindyli> anastasiac: i\'d like to hear ur advice of a better name for this - https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLOE-406
2015-08-31T14:02:20 <cindyli> as it said, what needs to be express is "the index of the top language button to display on the panel"
2015-08-31T14:04:43 <cindyli> indexOfTopLangToDisplay?

2015-08-31T14:10:59 <anastasiac> cindyli: what does \xe2\x80\x9ctop\xe2\x80\x9d mean in this context?
2015-08-31T14:11:04 <anastasiac> the first in the list?
2015-08-31T14:11:11 <anastasiac> or the one to be selected by default?
2015-08-31T14:11:13 <anastasiac> or something else?
2015-08-31T14:11:38 <simonjb> hey Bosmon, I was wondering if you might have some time this week to chat about the hybrid/untrusted Flow Manager?
2015-08-31T14:13:10 <cindyli> anastasiac: as u know, users can use arrow keys to move thru language buttons. at that time, we need to scroll the button div to make sure the focus button can be seen but not selected meaning not switching to that languge
2015-08-31T14:13:18 <Justin_o> cindyli: when you have a chance, could you please review this pull request https://github.com/fluid-project/first-discovery/pull/95
2015-08-31T14:13:36 <cindyli> the "top" is the first button on the viewed list, anastasiac
2015-08-31T14:13:47 <cindyli> sure, Justin_o
2015-08-31T14:14:45 <anastasiac> ah, cindyli, I see \xe2\x80\x93 the first in whatever is currently visible as the list scrolls. ok, hm\xe2\x80\xa6 <thinking>
2015-08-31T14:16:38 <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks

2015-08-31T15:00:25 <anastasiac> cindyli, regarding a new name for \xe2\x80\x9cdisplayLangIndex\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 something with \xe2\x80\x9cviewport\xe2\x80\x9d in it? \xe2\x80\x9cviewportTopIndex\xe2\x80\x9d? \xe2\x80\x9cviewportStartIndex\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9cviewportIndex\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cfirstViewportLang\xe2\x80\x9d
2015-08-31T15:01:16 <Justin_o> cindyli, anastasiac: do you know what has replaced fluid.demands in infusion master
2015-08-31T15:02:23 <anastasiac> Justin_o: not in particular, but I\xe2\x80\x99m going to guess that it might be the new context-awareness stuff

2015-08-31T20:09:01 <michelled> cindyli: maybe getting the sonification stuff tied up? otherwise, perhaps looking into Kaye\'s pull requests for UIO
2015-08-31T20:09:31 <michelled> Bosmon: were you going to be updating Kaye\'s UIO pull requests?
