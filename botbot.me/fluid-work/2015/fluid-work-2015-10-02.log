2015-10-02T13:05:18 <cindyli> kasparnet: do you know the length of a gpii token? is it a fixed length?
2015-10-02T13:10:52 <kasparnet> nope - I believe it can be any length
2015-10-02T13:10:59 <kasparnet> cindyli: ^
2015-10-02T13:11:23 <cindyli> ok. thanks, kasparnet
2015-10-02T13:13:46 <cindyli> kasparnet: is there a plan for the maximum length?

2015-10-02T13:20:07 * sepidehshahi joined the channel
2015-10-02T13:25:27 <kasparnet> cindyli: not as far as I know -- I think the general idea is that we\'d be using UUIDs
2015-10-02T13:25:31 <kasparnet> which are a fixed length
2015-10-02T13:26:12 <kasparnet> ... but I guess things like NFC tag and URL limits could be another limitation
2015-10-02T13:26:15 <kasparnet> cindyli: ^
2015-10-02T13:28:51 <cindyli> kasparnet: so, UUID method is used, a gpii token would be 32 hex digits + 4 dashes
2015-10-02T13:29:17 <kasparnet> yup, that sounds correct
2015-10-02T13:31:50 <cindyli> kasper, does the current preferences server already return UUIDs? or it returns another format?
2015-10-02T13:34:19 * jhernandez joined the channel
2015-10-02T13:37:10 <cindyli> anastasiac: do we have a document about how to integrate UI Options into a website, such as using em instead of px?
2015-10-02T13:38:02 <anastasiac> cindyli: check if this page has what you need: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/docs/Working+With+A+Preferences+Editor+On+Your+Site
2015-10-02T13:40:00 <cindyli> yes, it helps. thanks, anastasiac
2015-10-02T13:45:12 * jhung is now known as jhung_away
2015-10-02T13:52:51 <anastasiac> cindyli, I\xe2\x80\x99ve issued a small docs pull request, doing some reorganization: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/pull/76  Might you have a bit of time to look at it?
2015-10-02T13:53:03 <cindyli> sure, anastasiac
2015-10-02T13:57:48 * clown joined the channel
2015-10-02T13:58:00 <alanharnum> cindyli: expanding on my comment on pie scaling in the FLOE-412 pull request, would we want the drawn pie to respond dynamically to changes in text size from UIO?
2015-10-02T13:58:15 <alanharnum> (I think that\'s a rhetorical question, since I know the answer is "yes"...)
2015-10-02T13:58:54 * simonjb joined the channel
2015-10-02T13:58:55 <cindyli> alanharnum: probably not in this pull request. as you said, that can be addressed in FLOE-414
2015-10-02T13:59:17 <cindyli> i\'m replying ur comment too
2015-10-02T14:01:25 <simonjb> kasparnet: I can take a look at https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/395/files today -- is that still helpful?
2015-10-02T14:01:49 <kasparnet> simonjb: yeah, that would be great!
2015-10-02T14:02:20 <simonjb> kasparnet: ok, will take a look now

2015-10-02T14:39:49 <cindyli> anastasiac: i merged ur pull request for FLUID-5783. but i don\'t know how to deploy it to the docs site
2015-10-02T14:40:42 <anastasiac> oh, wonderful, cindyli, thanks. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think deployment is urgent. I expect more re-organization soon, with the prefs tutorial work I\xe2\x80\x99m doing, so I suggest we not worry about deploying yet. What do you think?
2015-10-02T14:41:00 <anastasiac> there\xe2\x80\x99s no new information or corrections
2015-10-02T14:41:06 <cindyli> cool
2015-10-02T15:11:48 <simonjb> kasparnet: I\'m making some progress on GPII-1286
2015-10-02T15:12:01 <simonjb> I\'ve got a small change that I think fixes
2015-10-02T15:12:33 <simonjb> but I don\'t yet fully understand yet why the breakage happens and why the fix fixes it
2015-10-02T15:12:33 * jhung joined the channel
2015-10-02T15:12:54 <simonjb> I\'m going to keep digging to understand in more detail what\'s happening
2015-10-02T15:13:54 <simonjb> kasparnet: the fix is gpii.tests.cloud.easit4all.testDefs = fluid.copy(require("./AcceptanceTests_easit4all_testDefs.json"));
2015-10-02T15:14:11 <simonjb> kasparnet: in AcceptanceTests_easit4all.js
2015-10-02T15:15:01 <simonjb> it looks like AcceptanceTests_easit4all.js and AcceptanceTests_easit4all_oauth2_filtering.js are modifying the same data structure
2015-10-02T15:15:44 <simonjb> and the added fluid.copy will ensure we get a separate instance of the loaded data -- not the one cached by node
2015-10-02T15:16:30 <simonjb> or rather, we will make a copy of the one cached by node before we modify it
2015-10-02T15:22:42 * jhung1 joined the channel
2015-10-02T15:31:27 <cindyli> simonjb: in case you didn\'t see the chat kasparnet and I had earlier today regarding the length of gpii tokens. kasparnet said, the general idea is that we\'d be using UUIDs
2015-10-02T15:36:08 <cindyli> but I\'m not sure if the prefs server already has UUID return implemented
2015-10-02T15:39:50 * alanharnum joined the channel
2015-10-02T15:40:09 <simonjb> ok, thanks cindyli
2015-10-02T15:40:16 <cindyli> np
2015-10-02T15:55:15 <colinclark> fluid-everyone: I\'m sorry I missed standup today; I\'ve been in meetings all morning. Here\'s a brief update: I met with David Bobier and Deb Fels about the Bodies In Translation proposal and how we\'ll be involved. Met with Kasper to start planning our approach to and needs for the Big Project. This afternoon I will mostly work on the BiT proposal.
2015-10-02T15:55:50 <anastasiac> so, colinclark, how will we be involved in the Bodies in Translation project? What is it?
2015-10-02T15:56:15 <colinclark> Good question, anastasiac :)
2015-10-02T15:56:32 <colinclark> It\'s a project about disability art, culture, and technology
2015-10-02T15:57:16 * clown joined the channel
2015-10-02T15:58:17 <anastasiac> and how will we be involved, colinclark?
2015-10-02T15:59:12 <colinclark> sorry, i\'m in a call
2015-10-02T15:59:17 <colinclark> so typing slowly, anastasiac :)
2015-10-02T15:59:31 <colinclark> we will co-lead a research stream with the Vibrafusion lab related to access to the arts via technology
2015-10-02T15:59:38 <anastasiac> oh, don\xe2\x80\x99t worry about it, colinclark, I\xe2\x80\x99m just curious
2015-10-02T15:59:48 <anastasiac> neat
2015-10-02T16:01:11 <colinclark> So I\'ll be proposing that we work in a co-design situation with a few artists to help take some of the tools we have in Floe and beyond (sonification, our video player, and some of the creative tools I\'ve been working on such as Flocking and Aconite) and adapt them for creative projects
2015-10-02T16:01:20 <colinclark> My hope is that it will be focused on performance
2015-10-02T16:01:48 <colinclark> so perhaps we will have some concerts, installations, or theatre performances that combine sound, visuals, and textual alternatives
2015-10-02T16:02:15 <colinclark> It\'s not much funding, so we\'ll try to keep it simple and connect it as much as possible to Floe and other active projects
2015-10-02T16:02:34 <anastasiac> very neat
2015-10-02T16:02:35 <anastasiac> thanks
