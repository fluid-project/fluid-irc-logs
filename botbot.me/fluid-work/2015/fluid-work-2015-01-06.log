2015-01-06T22:17:32 <Bosmon> simonjb - did you supply the OS option required to the /settings endpoint?
2015-01-06T22:18:10 <Bosmon> wait, sorry....
2015-01-06T22:18:23 <simonjb> Bosmon: we don't need that anymore, right?
2015-01-06T22:18:33 <Bosmon> right, ignore that
2015-01-06T22:18:36 <Bosmon> I am just unconfusing myself
2015-01-06T22:18:44 <simonjb> :)
2015-01-06T22:22:56 <simonjb> Bosmon: how much longer are you working? if a little longer, can we chat on skype?
2015-01-06T22:22:57 <Bosmon> ah yes
2015-01-06T22:23:01 <Bosmon> We just default to user web
2015-01-06T22:23:11 <Bosmon> simonjb - sure, I am working until this issue is resolved : P
2015-01-06T22:23:29 <Bosmon> I mean, OS web...

2015-01-06T19:37:45 <simonjb> Bosmon: here is a dataStore with Easit4All test users and client configured: https://github.com/simonbates/gpii-oauth2/blob/master/gpii-oauth2-datastore/src/DataStoreWithSampleData.js
2015-01-06T19:38:46 * michelled has quit
2015-01-06T19:38:48 <Bosmon> That\'s great, simonjb - thanks
2015-01-06T19:38:54 <Bosmon> Are the gpiiToken values there useful to them?
2015-01-06T19:39:02 <simonjb> Bosmon: yes
2015-01-06T19:39:15 <Bosmon> Ok
2015-01-06T19:39:55 <simonjb> Bosmon: we can get rid of the "util.format" calls
2015-01-06T19:40:13 <simonjb> and references to the config object
2015-01-06T19:41:01 <simonjb> Bosmon: we can use these values: https://github.com/simonbates/gpii-oauth2/blob/master/config.js
2015-01-06T19:41:07 * clown is now known as clown_mtg
2015-01-06T19:41:10 <Bosmon> simonjb - Yes, that would be great
2015-01-06T19:41:16 <simonjb> Bosmon: want me to prepare the file and send to you?
2015-01-06T19:41:27 <Bosmon> simonjb - sure, thanks
2015-01-06T19:41:40 <simonjb> Bosmon: will do
2015-01-06T19:58:35 <simonjb> Bosmon: I just emailed you a dataStore with the Easit4All test data
2015-01-06T19:59:15 <Bosmon> Thanks, simonjb - got it!
2015-01-06T19:59:33 <simonjb> Bosmon: it\'s a modified version of https://github.com/simonbates/universal/blob/GPII-17/examples/gpii-oauth2-sample-data/src/DataStoreWithSampleData.js
2015-01-06T20:00:08 <simonjb> Bosmon: which I guess we could just replace and use in your new config?
2015-01-06T20:00:39 <Bosmon> sure - although I\'m not sure of the values of having a top-level config employ sample data
2015-01-06T20:00:45 <Bosmon> Perhaps the config itself could go into samples as well
2015-01-06T20:01:42 <simonjb> Bosmon: yes, that\'s maybe a good idea -- this config will be temporary and will be replaced once we have CouchDB persistence implemented
2015-01-06T20:18:42 <Justin_o> Bosmon: do you have a couple minutes to chat?
2015-01-06T20:18:50 <Justin_o> i have to leave in about 10 min though

2015-01-06T21:23:13 <simonjb> hi Bosmon, how\'s it going with the CBFM config?
2015-01-06T21:24:04 <Bosmon> simonjb - not too bad
2015-01-06T21:24:12 <Bosmon> Just trying to construct a standalone driver file for it
2015-01-06T21:24:20 <Bosmon> I expect to be done shortly
2015-01-06T21:24:26 <simonjb> Bosmon: cool
2015-01-06T21:25:25 * cindyli has quit
2015-01-06T21:42:31 <Bosmon> simonjb - ok, I think I have it working
2015-01-06T21:42:39 <Bosmon> Do you happen to know if we have a headline JIRA for the EASIT integration?
2015-01-06T21:43:15 <simonjb> Bosmon: I don\'t believe that we do
2015-01-06T21:43:28 <Bosmon> ok
2015-01-06T21:43:34 <Bosmon> I\'ll just add it to my existing GPII-17 branch then
2015-01-06T21:43:40 <simonjb> Bosmon: cool
2015-01-06T21:46:44 * anvk has quit
2015-01-06T21:46:59 * clown joined the channel
2015-01-06T21:47:23 <Bosmon> simonjb - ok, it\'s up at https://github.com/amb26/universal/tree/GPII-17
2015-01-06T21:47:31 <Bosmon> Would you like to check it out to see if it seems basically sane?
2015-01-06T21:47:51 <Bosmon> You can start the whole thing up from the dedicated driver held at examples/easit-oauth-integration/driver.js
2015-01-06T21:48:23 <simonjb> Bosmon: awesome, will take a look now
2015-01-06T21:48:30 <Bosmon> I\'m not sure if you can think of a quick way of checking that the endpoint actually works, but there seems to be reasonable evidence that it will
2015-01-06T21:48:43 <Bosmon> I verified that the new datastore starts up, and that there is an endpoint at /settings which returns a 401
2015-01-06T21:49:13 <simonjb> Bosmon: I can test with one of our sample clients
2015-01-06T21:49:25 <Bosmon> Ah cool
2015-01-06T21:49:32 <simonjb> Bosmon: does it start up a preferences server too?
2015-01-06T21:49:41 <Bosmon> perhaps you could add some details of how to do that to my README file
2015-01-06T21:49:53 <Bosmon> simonjb - yes, it starts up the development configuration with the integrated preferences server
2015-01-06T21:49:59 <simonjb> Bosmon: cool
2015-01-06T21:50:13 <Bosmon> So it will host the contents of the testData/preferences directory
2015-01-06T21:50:44 <Bosmon> So this will be read-only, naturally - but I believe that this is all that will be exercised for the review demo
2015-01-06T21:52:47 <simonjb> Bosmon: in that case, I think we\'d want to have the users specified in https://github.com/amb26/universal/blob/14bda30c48760fd73abf3615436215030403baa5/examples/easit-oauth-integration/EasitTestOauthDatastore.js to have gpiiTokens for which we have preferences
2015-01-06T21:53:00 <Bosmon> simonjb - yes
2015-01-06T21:53:14 <Bosmon> This is why i was asking initially about the particular values of the gpiiTokens ....
2015-01-06T21:53:28 <simonjb> like maybe we leave the easit ones alone and change alice and bob to 2 of our typical test users
2015-01-06T21:54:02 <simonjb> Bosmon: or more than 2
2015-01-06T21:54:32 <Bosmon> simonjb - sure
2015-01-06T21:54:47 <simonjb> Bosmon: regarding the test31, test32, test33 those were given to me by Barcelona so let\'s leave those
2015-01-06T21:55:14 <simonjb> Bosmon: but we can replace the others with some of our \'standard\' test users
2015-01-06T21:55:35 <simonjb> Bosmon: then we should be able to retrieve the preferences, right?
2015-01-06T21:55:40 <Bosmon> yes, should be
2015-01-06T21:56:16 <simonjb> Bosmon: awesome, shall I get it running here and then make the changes? what users should I use?
2015-01-06T21:57:03 <Bosmon> simonjb - I guess one of the users we use in the cloud4chrome tests might make sense
2015-01-06T21:57:20 * anastasiac has quit
2015-01-06T21:57:23 <Bosmon> I guess we should advise them that they can just dump extra users in the testData/preferences directory in their branch if they need
2015-01-06T21:57:46 <simonjb> Bosmon: yes, for sure
2015-01-06T22:00:28 <Bosmon> Simply creating new drivers like this might be a good approach for what avtar needs for deployment in any case
2015-01-06T22:00:45 <Bosmon> Since we could, for example, arrange to incorporate whatever environment variables it turns out that he needs
2015-01-06T22:00:55 <Bosmon> The process is a little bit crabby at the moment but it is not too bad

2015-01-06T22:08:06 <simonjb> Bosmon: but unfortunately not a lot of info on what is going wrong
2015-01-06T22:08:06 <Bosmon> simonjb - what does it say?
2015-01-06T22:08:41 <Bosmon> ok
2015-01-06T22:08:46 <Bosmon> Can you tell me what I can do to reproduce?
2015-01-06T22:11:07 <simonjb> Bosmon: sorry my bad -- I had misconfigured -- I\'m now getting a response from /settings
2015-01-06T22:12:28 <Bosmon> oh cool - what kind of misconfiguration was it?
2015-01-06T22:13:22 <simonjb> Bosmon: it was in my sample client -- I forgot I had 2 port numbers: one for auth and one for resource -- I had updated the auth but not the resource
2015-01-06T22:14:04 <Bosmon> ah ok
2015-01-06T22:14:05 <simonjb> Bosmon: I set up user sammy but am getting an empty "{}" response from /settings -- investigating
2015-01-06T22:14:55 <Bosmon> simonjb - it may be that none of those preferences correspond to settings when converted to OS "web"
2015-01-06T22:15:04 <simonjb> ah, yes
2015-01-06T22:15:20 <Bosmon> Try with user "chrome_high_contrast" for example
2015-01-06T22:15:35 <simonjb> Bosmon: will do
