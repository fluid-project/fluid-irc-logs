2015-09-02T13:05:27 <cindyli> hi simonjb
2015-09-02T13:05:58 <Justin_o> simonjb: hello
2015-09-02T13:06:12 <simonjb> let\'s meet in my room on vidyo
2015-09-02T13:06:15 <cindyli> ok
2015-09-02T13:08:06 <Justin_o> okay

2015-09-02T13:16:41 <anastasiac> Justin_o, cindyli: I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to understand the difference (if any) between \xe2\x80\x9c{context-name}\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c${context-name}\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d  Can you advise?
2015-09-02T13:17:22 <Justin_o> i think the $ syntax is supposed to be used in the prototree, if that\'s where you are seeing it
2015-09-02T13:18:56 <anastasiac> ah, that does seem to be the case, Justin_o. Would you be able to explain why it\xe2\x80\x99s there, what it means, what\xe2\x80\x99s the difference?
2015-09-02T13:19:09 <anastasiac> is it doing something different, specifically?
2015-09-02T13:19:18 <Justin_o> I can\'t quite remember, but it may have to do with valuebinding
2015-09-02T13:19:50 <anastasiac> ok, thanks, Justin_o
2015-09-02T13:20:10 <Justin_o> sorry, it was from when yzen was still here, so it\'s been a while :(

2015-09-02T13:29:32 <anastasiac> Bosmon, I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to understand the difference between \xe2\x80\x9c{context-name}\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c${context-name}\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d  I know the latter is used in prototrees, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not clear to me why - what does it signify? How would you explain it to someone?
2015-09-02T13:31:54 * yzen joined the channel
2015-09-02T13:49:34 * anastasiac joined the channel
2015-09-02T13:54:52 <alanharnum> anastasiac cindyli: if I find instances in the First Discovery API documentation linking to https://wiki.fluidproject.org should I relink them to the corresponding page on http://docs.fluidproject.org/ if it exists?
2015-09-02T13:55:11 <anastasiac> oh, yes, thank you alanharnum, that would be great
2015-09-02T13:55:31 <alanharnum> anastasiac: thanks

2015-09-02T14:26:54 <alanharnum> anastasiac: another thing i\'ve noticed - the "Still need help?" panel goes to http://fluidproject.org/mailman/listinfo/infusion-users (a 404) - I think this should be http://lists.idrc.ocad.ca/mailman/listinfo/infusion-users instead?
2015-09-02T14:27:30 <anastasiac> ah, yes alanharnum, good catch, thanks. I think that should be fixable in a single included file (i.e. shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t require multiple fixes)
2015-09-02T14:27:50 <alanharnum> anastasiac: yeah I\'m looking at that now - I think it\'s a macro
2015-09-02T14:28:13 <alanharnum> i don\'t understand Confluence terribly well but hopefully just an in-one-place replacement (I\'ll try that now)
2015-09-02T14:31:53 <alanharnum> anastasiac: doesn\'t look like it\'s an included file - I changed it via the editor on https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/First+Discovery+API+Documentation but that didn\'t cascade
2015-09-02T14:33:04 <alanharnum> is there a trick i\'m missing to easier global or in-page search and replace with Confluence? I suspect not, googling around a bit, but here\'s hoping :(

2015-09-02T14:54:44 <anastasiac> ah, shoot, alanharnum, you\xe2\x80\x99re right. I had centralized that in the infusion-docs-specific wiki space, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not that way here :-( And no, I know of no easy way to change something on many pages; that\xe2\x80\x99s why I used the incuded page for stuff like this!

2015-09-02T15:14:57 <cindyli> Bosmon and kasparnet, i start working on using couchdb for saving authentication related data for the OAuth security server - https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-1274, GPII prefs server seems already using couchDB for production. do you have some best practice notes or examples of using couchDB that i can refer to
2015-09-02T15:17:07 <cindyli> the prefs server seems using "kettle.dataSource.CouchDB", should i use the same component as the underlying layer?
