2015-06-23T14:42:43 <Justin_o> that\'s so sad
2015-06-23T14:42:48 <Bosmon> No worries :)
2015-06-23T14:47:07 <Justin_o> Bosmon: thanks for the help though.. https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/612 is ready for another round of review.. so is https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/566
2015-06-23T14:47:30 <Bosmon> Cheers, Justin_o
2015-06-23T14:49:55 <Justin_o> michelled: I\'m going to make a new repo for the chart authoring stuff.. do you think this should be called chartAuthoringTool, sonification, or something else?
2015-06-23T14:52:02 <michelled> good question Justin_o. I suppose we will eventually have two things - a sonificaiton framework and a chart authoring tool
2015-06-23T14:52:07 <michelled> that uses it

2015-06-23T16:42:20 <murilocrivellari> Justin_o: no problem! By the way, I suppose we should ask michelled on the textures...
2015-06-23T16:44:29 <Justin_o> murilocrivellari: oh yes, good point
2015-06-23T16:45:00 <Justin_o> michelled: danayo, murilocrivellari and I were chatting a bit about whether to do the textures or greyscale for the first pass on the chart.
2015-06-23T16:45:57 <danayo> i was concerned that grey scale is not accessible to many users and wondered if adding or replacing it with textures would add much more work
2015-06-23T16:46:12 <danayo> wondered what you thought michelled
2015-06-23T16:46:27 <michelled> I\'m interested in getting a first slice of the tool available to show people as soon as possible
2015-06-23T16:46:47 <michelled> so I\'d like to constrain to the absolute minimum and then add features
2015-06-23T16:46:54 <michelled> what that absolute minimum is, I\'m open to
2015-06-23T16:47:17 <danayo> ok. i guess the question is - would implementing textures take more time than grey scale?
2015-06-23T16:47:39 <danayo> and if yes is it too much time

2015-06-23T17:08:24 <Justin_o> jhung: do you have a thought on that ^
2015-06-23T17:12:35 * avtar has quit
2015-06-23T17:16:10 <jhung> Justin_o, danayo, murilocrivellari: textures may not be all that hard to do. We can use a background image and repeat the pattern. We can use an SVG or even standard bitmap (though it won\'t scale as nicely, but maybe that\'s acceptable?).
2015-06-23T17:16:40 <jhung> It is a bit more work but it\'ll be more accessible than using greys.
2015-06-23T17:17:08 <jhung> Alternatively, we can go with alternating black and white slices on the pie, and just label the slices directly.
2015-06-23T17:17:45 <Justin_o> jhung: that might be an issue if we have an odd number of slices
2015-06-23T17:18:23 <jhung> Justin_o: yes. I was thinking in that case we can introduce a gap between those slices?
2015-06-23T17:18:42 <jhung> not a big gap\xe2\x80\xa6 just enough to distinguish the two
2015-06-23T17:19:01 * avtar joined the channel
2015-06-23T17:19:46 <danayo> how about grey scale with labels (if no textures)
2015-06-23T17:20:24 <danayo> and borders?
2015-06-23T17:21:16 <danayo> jhung, Justin_o?
2015-06-23T17:21:39 <jhung> danayo: I think labels in general are a great idea regardless of how we decide to colour in the chart.
2015-06-23T17:22:19 <Justin_o> danayo, jhung: yes to labels of some sort
2015-06-23T17:22:28 <jhung> We can go with grey for now. We\'d have to take care to choose good WCAG 2.0 compliant greys that alternate shades properly if you get what I mean danayo
2015-06-23T17:22:35 <Justin_o> i guess we might also need to see what the charting tool we land on provides us
2015-06-23T17:22:45 * the-t-in-rtf joined the channel
2015-06-23T17:23:26 <Justin_o> jhung, danayo: I think WCAG 2.0 is only concerned with the text and it\'s background colour..
2015-06-23T17:23:58 * michelled has quit
2015-06-23T17:24:19 <jhung> yes. In this case we would treat on slice like text and another as background. So when placed side-by-side there\'s sufficient contrast. I think we\'d alternate between dark and light greys?

2015-06-23T17:29:01 <danayo> i\'m thinking that alternating (B/W or dark/light) with an odd number of slices and a gap might be a bit confusing - jhung you said you thought textures wouldn\'t be much more work? can we try it?
2015-06-23T17:32:32 <jhung> danayo: How polished does this have to be? Perhaps a grey-scale version is sufficient for short term? For the textures, we\'d have to do a little research into possible implementations. Ideally we\'d want one that scales nicely and is easily customizable using CSS.
2015-06-23T17:35:21 <danayo> I\'m not sure jhung. I guess a labelled grey scale would be ok for first pass
2015-06-23T17:37:45 <jhung> danayo: I guess we\'ll have to make sure to file a jira for investigating the use of textures and implement when there\'s time. I\'d be interested in doing some research into this when I have time. It sounds like fun.
