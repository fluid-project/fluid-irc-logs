2015-05-01T15:35:36 <Bosmon7> Hi there Justin_o
2015-05-01T15:47:30 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: hello
2015-05-01T15:48:25 <Bosmon7> Given this is a question about the renderer, I will at the outset try to forestall problems by saying....
2015-05-01T15:48:28 <Bosmon7> I\'M VERY SORRY : P
2015-05-01T15:48:48 <Bosmon7> I will be able to start work on the new one just as soon as colinclark has the monster pull in the bag :)
2015-05-01T15:49:18 <colinclark> lol
2015-05-01T15:49:20 <colinclark> eek
2015-05-01T15:49:22 <colinclark> no pressure, colinclark
2015-05-01T15:49:34 <colinclark> Is the FD tool using the monster pull request at the moment?
2015-05-01T15:49:37 <Bosmon7> no
2015-05-01T15:49:42 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: So basically what I was trying to do with the renderer yesterday, is working. But i wanted to clean some more things up. I had been using styling to hide and show an element, but I think this makes more sense to be just handled by the renderer by not including it in the prototree. However, how do i go about showing the element when all i want is for
2015-05-01T15:49:42 <Justin_o> it to be there, but nothing else to happen, since it is rendered by a subcomponent
2015-05-01T15:49:44 <Bosmon7> I don\'t think we will update it before the demo
2015-05-01T15:49:48 <Bosmon7> Well, we could
2015-05-01T15:49:55 <Bosmon7> If we think we have "cash in hand".....
2015-05-01T15:49:58 <colinclark> whatever costs the least :)
2015-05-01T15:50:04 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: also i appreciate your proactive apologies :)
2015-05-01T15:50:41 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - can\'t you just wire up the standard show/hide listener to a model field?
2015-05-01T15:51:42 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: i could, we had used styling to using visibililty: hidden so things wouldn\'t jump around as much, but i think there have been some other changes along the way that will cause that anyways
2015-05-01T15:52:21 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: but it would also mean that i\'d have to render out the markup just to hide it, since in those rendering states it is never shown
2015-05-01T15:52:32 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - I see
2015-05-01T15:52:40 <Bosmon7> I think it\'s a small price to pay
2015-05-01T15:53:01 <Bosmon7> Browsers these days tend to batch up DOM manipulations into fairly chunky transactions these days anyway
2015-05-01T15:53:04 <Bosmon7> As colinclark will attest
2015-05-01T15:53:09 <colinclark> don\'t even remind me
2015-05-01T15:53:29 <colinclark> Justin_o: I had a case where I had a whole series of show/hide behaviour happening
2015-05-01T15:53:42 <colinclark> and Chrome just kindly decided that I didn\'t actually want some of those operations :P
2015-05-01T15:54:20 <Justin_o> colinclark: really?
2015-05-01T15:54:29 <colinclark> yeah, it was awful
2015-05-01T15:54:33 <Justin_o> colinclark: how did you convince it
2015-05-01T15:54:37 <colinclark> it involved all kinds of voodoo
2015-05-01T15:54:46 <colinclark> putting things in setTimeouts and the like
2015-05-01T15:54:52 <Bosmon7> Yes... I think you can generally expect that any manipulations you do on the same stack will resolve in the browser as a single unit
2015-05-01T15:54:57 <colinclark> in the end I did a fairly massive restructuring and the issue just "disappeared"
2015-05-01T15:55:06 <Bosmon7> So it\'s unlikely the user will see any "jank" resulting from a DOM element which is rendered and then immediately hidden
2015-05-01T15:55:24 <colinclark> yes, that\'s quite likely the case in my experience
2015-05-01T15:55:42 <colinclark> Chrome was obviously intentionally trying to avoid what it thought were redundant DOM operations
2015-05-01T15:56:02 <colinclark> Justin_o: So it was one of those classic cases where my code would run when I had a breakpoint set in it, but not otherwise
2015-05-01T15:56:18 <Justin_o> colinclark: those are really annoying
2015-05-01T15:56:54 <Bosmon7> I think it\'s not worth trying to address such a marginal issue until we have the "new renderer" in which case one would hope it would just be handled automatically
2015-05-01T15:57:43 <Bosmon7> colinclark and I had an interesting time a couple of weeks ago looking over the code for "react.js" to see the kinds of things that are expected of a modern rendering system : P
2015-05-01T15:57:43 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: i\'m hoping for a lot from the new renderer :)
2015-05-01T15:58:28 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - well, you\'ve waited long enough for it :)
2015-05-01T16:00:07 <Bosmon7> My sense is that a huge part of its visible implementation will consist of a new configuration area named "relayComponents" or so
2015-05-01T16:00:25 <Bosmon7> Unless you\'d prefer a better name : P
2015-05-01T16:00:42 <Bosmon7> Which will lead to that thing named "dynamicComponents" also being deprecated
2015-05-01T16:01:03 <Bosmon7> But the idea is that you would point each "relayComponents" area at a path in a model which holds some material that you would like "relayed into components"
2015-05-01T16:02:31 <Bosmon7> Of which, I imagine, there would be special support for booleans and arrays, primarily
2015-05-01T16:02:52 <Bosmon7> Anything else would just behave quite similarly to a conventional subcomponent

2015-05-01T16:09:57 <Justin_o> Bosmon: cool
2015-05-01T16:19:33 <Justin_o> Bosmon: can we have a way for modelListeners to only fire if the values are true or false
2015-05-01T16:19:50 <Justin_o> i seem to have lots of cases were we just want to fire on one condition or the other
2015-05-01T16:20:10 * anastasiac has quit
2015-05-01T16:20:23 <Justin_o> and an easy way to change a model value between true and false would be awesome too
2015-05-01T16:31:00 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes
2015-05-01T16:31:09 <Bosmon> This will result from the REDUCED EXPRESSION PARSER : P
2015-05-01T16:31:24 <Bosmon> Another thing I was looking at with colinclark yesterday....
2015-05-01T16:31:26 <Justin_o> i don\'t think i\'ve heard of that before
2015-05-01T16:31:39 <Bosmon> For example, under the head of the SHUNTING YARD ALGORITHM : P
2015-05-01T16:31:41 <Bosmon> http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Parsing/Shunting-yard_algorithm#JavaScript
2015-05-01T16:32:18 <Bosmon> I\'m not sure about your "modelListeners firing only on one condition or the other" case though
2015-05-01T16:32:29 <Bosmon> It sounds like this should be dealt with either by relay or in the "materialisation strategy"...
2015-05-01T16:33:25 * colinclark has quit
2015-05-01T16:36:50 <Justin_o> "materialisation strategy"?
2015-05-01T16:39:52 <Bosmon> Well, you know
2015-05-01T16:40:00 <Bosmon> "Anything which is connected to a modelListener which is not a model" : P
2015-05-01T16:42:56 * michelled has quit
2015-05-01T16:43:23 <Justin_o> Bosmon: ah i see
2015-05-01T16:44:25 <Justin_o> i guess we\'re already using that strategy
