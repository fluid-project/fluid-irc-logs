2015-02-03T18:17:32 <simonjb> Bosmon: I was just trying to run the universal/tests/web/html/all-tests.html and they appear to get stuck on the first test (CanopyMatchMakerTest.html); I\'m running the tests on my GPII-17 branch and see this in both FF and Chrome
2015-02-03T18:18:33 <Bosmon> Hi - that\'s odd, simonjb
2015-02-03T18:18:39 <Bosmon> They run ok in my instance of the branch
2015-02-03T18:18:58 <Bosmon> Do you see any errors in the console?
2015-02-03T18:20:28 * yzen is now known as yzen_
2015-02-03T18:23:00 <simonjb> Bosmon: "Error: Permission denied to access property \'QUnit\'"
2015-02-03T18:23:28 <Bosmon> Very odd
2015-02-03T18:23:35 <Bosmon> What I imagine is that this is a cross-iframe protection issue
2015-02-03T18:23:47 <Bosmon> Could you try running them mounted from a local HTTP server?
2015-02-03T18:24:06 <simonjb> Bosmon: yes, good idea -- I\'m running from the filesystem
2015-02-03T18:24:27 <simonjb> Bosmon: when they work for you, are you running from a web server?
2015-02-03T18:26:00 <Bosmon> Well, no.... but I notice that they do actually fail in Chrome for me too - if I run into this problem either I use the peculiar command-line switch or else an HTTP server
2015-02-03T18:26:04 <Bosmon> They do run fine for me in FF though
2015-02-03T18:26:17 <Bosmon> Since this has traditionally been a bit more humane about FS permissions
2015-02-03T18:27:30 <Bosmon> Wow
2015-02-03T18:27:39 <Bosmon> I just accidentally Googled for "Netscape Options"
2015-02-03T18:27:46 <Bosmon> Talk about Freudian Slip : P
2015-02-03T18:27:47 <simonjb> Bosmon :)
2015-02-03T18:28:07 <simonjb> Bosmon: configuring my web server now, will let you know
2015-02-03T18:28:43 <Bosmon> simonjb - I imagine that the security policy in question is the same one described on this wiki page
2015-02-03T18:28:45 <Bosmon> http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Browser+settings+to+support+local+Ajax+calls
2015-02-03T18:29:00 <Bosmon> And that therefore the reason they run for me in FF is that I have this option enabled
2015-02-03T18:40:57 <simonjb> Bosmon: yep, they run fine on both FF and Chrome when served from a web server

2015-02-03T20:15:25 <Justin_o> cindyli1: could you take  look at my latests pull request that addresses the dependency file issue https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/584
