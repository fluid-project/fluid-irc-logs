2015-12-16T18:54:04 <colinclark> I will be in about 20 minutes
2015-12-16T18:55:02 <simonjb> colinclark: how about in an hour?
2015-12-16T18:55:27 <colinclark> I have a 4 pm meeting over at Ryerson
2015-12-16T18:56:33 <colinclark> but I can meet until 3:45 pm
2015-12-16T18:57:03 <simonjb> colinclark: ok, great, I hope it will be short
2015-12-16T18:57:29 <simonjb> I\'m having dinner with my parents in about 20 mins and will ping you after
2015-12-16T18:57:37 <simonjb> michelled: does that work for you?

2015-12-16T20:49:30 <simonjb> sepidehshahi: I spent today investigating what would be needed to integrate AsTeRICS and my feeling is that it is probably our best choice in the short term
2015-12-16T20:50:40 <sepidehshahi> I totally agree
2015-12-16T20:51:21 <simonjb> I think that in the time that we have before the demo, I\'d like to focus on AsTeRICS
2015-12-16T20:51:45 * Yan_Hu1 joined the channel
2015-12-16T20:51:47 <simonjb> I\'ve started to make some progress and I think it makes sense to continue on with it
2015-12-16T20:52:40 <simonjb> we had arranged to meet again tomorrow to discuss the demo and the Nexus but I\'m thinking that we could delay that further discussion to January
2015-12-16T20:53:05 <simonjb> I\'d like to focus tomorrow on making more progress with the Nexus and with AsTeRICS
2015-12-16T20:53:19 <sepidehshahi> for sure. I think you have a very practical plan, please let us know how else we could help out if you needed anything
2015-12-16T20:53:41 <simonjb> thanks very much, I will
2015-12-16T20:57:35 <danayo> ok simonjb
2015-12-16T20:57:40 <danayo> sounds like a good plan
2015-12-16T20:57:48 <simonjb> danayo: ok, awesome
2015-12-16T20:58:55 <simonjb> danayo, sepidehshahi: so let\'s reconnect about the demo in January and in the immediate term, I will focus on integrating AsTeRICS
2015-12-16T20:59:41 <sepidehshahi> sounds good to me. talk to you in January then
2015-12-16T20:59:52 <danayo> ok simonjb sepidehshahi
2015-12-16T21:00:23 <simonjb> great, have a good rest of the day -- I\'m going to sign off now

2015-12-16T21:59:19 <Bosmon7> Hi anastasiac - I have a pull ready for the "storeType" issue at https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/660/files
2015-12-16T21:59:46 <anastasiac> Bosmon7, wonderful, thanks! I\xe2\x80\x99ll try out my sample code with it
2015-12-16T22:00:19 <Bosmon7> It looks like this code path had rotted completely away in the meantime - since we had a test implementation of the store that wouldn\'t even instantiate
2015-12-16T22:00:25 <Bosmon7> So I guess we had never tried : P

2015-12-16T14:35:11 * sepidehshahi has quit
2015-12-16T14:36:23 <Bosmon7> So anastasiac, cindyli - this section in Builder.js needs to be axed: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/preferences/js/Builder.js#L76
2015-12-16T14:36:47 <Bosmon7> Here are the ContextAwareness docs: http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/ContextAwareness.html
2015-12-16T14:37:31 <Bosmon7> The code in Builder.js needs to be replaced to simply read type: "fluid.prefs.globalSettingsStore" and then to apply the storeType in a distribution rather than as a direct grade name
2015-12-16T14:38:16 * cindyli joined the channel
2015-12-16T14:38:20 <anastasiac> Bosmon7: Would you be able to file a jira and a pull request?
2015-12-16T14:39:09 <Bosmon7> anastasiac - here\'s the contextAwareness block that the distribution needs to hit: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/preferences/js/Store.js#L34
2015-12-16T14:39:22 <anastasiac> and any associated updates to the prefs framework documentation, in particular this page: http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/PreferencesEditor.html ?
2015-12-16T14:40:38 <Bosmon7> anastasiac - So I\'m interested that this test passes: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/tests/framework-tests/preferences/js/BuilderTests.js#L656
2015-12-16T14:40:45 <Bosmon7> Are you able to square this with what you saw yesterday?
2015-12-16T14:41:10 <Bosmon7> anastasiac - we shouldn\'t need to make any change to the docs
2015-12-16T14:41:38 <anastasiac> Bosmon7: so the storeType option to fluid.prefs.create would work, with your proposed change?
2015-12-16T14:42:03 <Bosmon7> anastasiac we can keep that, no need for gratuitous API incompatibility
2015-12-16T14:42:22 <anastasiac> that would be good, since it\xe2\x80\x99s an easier approach for integrators
2015-12-16T14:42:26 <Bosmon7> I\'m guessing that perhaps this functionality has never worked as we intended?
2015-12-16T14:42:33 <Bosmon7> Since our tests are still passing
2015-12-16T14:42:44 <anastasiac> Bosmon7: we haven\xe2\x80\x99t found any actual implementations that actuall use that option
2015-12-16T14:42:57 <Bosmon7> That would be a "yes" then :)
2015-12-16T14:43:07 <anastasiac> ;_)
2015-12-16T14:44:17 <Bosmon7> I guess the docs are actually faulty
2015-12-16T14:44:39 <Bosmon7> Since "fluid.prefs.globalSettingsStore" should be nothing of interest to the integrator
2015-12-16T14:44:51 <Bosmon7> We can keep the same option name, but just make it do something actually useful
2015-12-16T14:45:02 <Bosmon7> That is, allow them to configure the type of store that the system uses : P
2015-12-16T14:45:26 <Bosmon7> anastasiac - out of interest, what kind of store are we trying to integrate here, and where is the code for it?

2015-12-16T14:47:27 <Justin_o> michelled: came across a bug today with the first discovery tool integration https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-1539
2015-12-16T14:50:48 <Justin_o> michelled: any thoughts on how critical that is.. I\'m planning on working on it when I have spare time from the FLOE-430 work
2015-12-16T14:51:58 * yzen joined the channel
2015-12-16T14:52:53 <michelled> that seems reasonable Justin_o - although you will probably want to prioritize updating the docs for the PGA team
2015-12-16T14:53:21 <Justin_o> michelled: yah, i have those written up now. anastasiac has been looking over them.
2015-12-16T14:54:15 <michelled> great!
2015-12-16T14:56:18 * the-t-in-rtf joined the channel
2015-12-16T15:01:50 <anastasiac> Bosmon7: sorry, I stepped away from my desk. Regarding your question \xe2\x80\x9cwhat kind of store are we trying to integrate here?\xe2\x80\x9d At the moment, I\xe2\x80\x99m just trying to substitute anything successfully, so that I can document how to do it. Using the contextAwareness worked, but the option didn\xe2\x80\x99t.
2015-12-16T15:02:16 <anastasiac> The PGA IBM team is investigating how they will store prefs for the pilots, so they will likely be wanting to do this
2015-12-16T15:02:27 <anastasiac> they haven\xe2\x80\x99t yet decided how the prefs will be stored
2015-12-16T15:02:37 <anastasiac> so I don\xe2\x80\x99t yet know exactly what will be implemented
2015-12-16T15:02:52 <Bosmon7> Ok
2015-12-16T15:03:12 <Bosmon7> anastasiac - so we never yet produced a "gpii prefs server aware" store for UIO?
2015-12-16T15:03:35 <anastasiac> Bosmon7: to my knowledge, no, but cindyli or Justin_o might be in a better position to answer
2015-12-16T15:03:52 <anastasiac> it\xe2\x80\x99s a good question, since I believe that task is coming up soon
2015-12-16T15:04:21 <Bosmon7> Presumably it is actually THIS task
2015-12-16T15:04:58 <Justin_o> anastasiac, Bosmon7: not in the traditional sense anyways, We do save preferences to the prefs server though, but not through this exact workflow. cindyli could probably elaborate more
2015-12-16T15:05:21 <anastasiac> Justin_o, cindyli: UIO saves to the prefs server?
2015-12-16T15:05:56 <Justin_o> anastasiac: not UIO sorry, first discovery, but they are both instances of a prefs editor
2015-12-16T15:05:59 * clown joined the channel
2015-12-16T15:06:15 <Bosmon7> Justin_o - ok - and presumably then you are not using this "storeType" option to configure the store
2015-12-16T15:06:23 <Bosmon7> I wonder what you are using, and how it relates to our docs
2015-12-16T15:06:24 <Justin_o> in terms of UIO we having been going through the designs at the design crit for how it will look, as it involves integration with the security server and etc.
2015-12-16T15:06:31 <cindyli> anastasiac, Bosmon7, Justin_o, we implemented a gpii store for exploration tool a couple of years ago - https://github.com/GPII/prefsEditors/blob/master/src/explorationTool/js/GpiiStore.js
2015-12-16T15:06:37 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: no, still use the cookie store

2015-12-16T15:06:52 <cindyli> but i don\'t think it\'s using the schema version by passing in a storeType
2015-12-16T15:07:15 <cindyli> still looking up
2015-12-16T15:07:17 <Bosmon7> It does seem to use exactly the same option though
2015-12-16T15:07:26 <Bosmon7> Perhaps this has not been tested since the framework upgrade?
2015-12-16T15:07:49 <Bosmon7> Or perhaps FD never made it to the framework upgrade yet

2015-12-16T15:08:53 <Justin_o> Bosmon7: i believe the FD is using the framework upgrade, but the exploration tool may not. It\'s also in the GPII space though, so you may have looked at it with your recent work, not sure.
2015-12-16T15:09:30 <Bosmon7> I don\'t know what the distinction is between FD and the "exploration tool"
2015-12-16T15:09:47 <cindyli> Bosmon7, they are different projects
2015-12-16T15:10:09 <Bosmon7> Yes
2015-12-16T15:10:11 <cindyli> the exploration tool was using the grade version of prefs framework - https://github.com/GPII/prefsEditors/blob/master/demos/explorationTool/demo.js#L57
2015-12-16T15:10:26 <Bosmon7> I guess I have heard of one and not of the other... or at least, I don\'t seem to remember anything about this "exploration tool"
2015-12-16T15:10:32 <Bosmon7> Can you remind me a bit about the background?
2015-12-16T15:10:48 <michelled> here\'s the demo Bosmon7: http://build.fluidproject.org/prefsEditors/demos/explorationTool/
2015-12-16T15:11:02 <michelled> click \'doesn\'t make sense\' at the bottom
2015-12-16T15:11:19 <Bosmon7> Oh wow
2015-12-16T15:11:33 <Bosmon7> I really don\'t remember this at all
2015-12-16T15:11:56 <Bosmon7> But yes, it sounds like the "GpiiStore" has only ever been deployed against ancient versions of the prefs framework
2015-12-16T15:12:01 <Bosmon7> I\'ll issue a JIRA and PR later today, anastasiac
2015-12-16T15:12:06 <michelled> it was phase 1 of PGA
2015-12-16T15:12:24 <Bosmon7> phase 1 of PGA!
2015-12-16T15:12:46 <anastasiac> Bosmon7: that would be great, thanks. Once the fix is in Infusion, we can upgrade the FD tool\xe2\x80\x99s copy of Infusion, so that the IBM team will have access to the fixed code
