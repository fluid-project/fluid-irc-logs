b'2015-01-29T14:11:02 <Bosmon> That\'s a great point about the ginger reference to {pageEnhancer}
2015-01-29T14:11:05 <Justin_o> wow.. it\'s a super power
2015-01-29T14:11:17 <Bosmon> But I don\'t think we can do much about it during this work package
2015-01-29T14:11:37 <Justin_o> okay.. so just something i guess we\'ll need to document somewhere
2015-01-29T14:11:39 <Bosmon> The problem is you can\'t FORCE code to execute a var x = ..... statement before it has been seen
2015-01-29T14:11:52 <Bosmon> Once we have the ASYNCHRONOUS GINGER WORLD we\'ll be able to solve problems like this
2015-01-29T14:12:14 <Justin_o> i see, because we can wait around to see when it does get resolved?
2015-01-29T14:12:14 <Bosmon> Since we will get people used to the idea that components don\'t necessary construct at the point where var x = constuctor() call is seen
2015-01-29T14:12:24 <Bosmon> but that really will be a big and disruptive revolution
2015-01-29T14:13:00 <Bosmon> But yes, in future it will be possible for a component that has a visible demand, say, on a {pageEnhancer} to suspend until one arrives
2015-01-29T14:13:09 <Bosmon> This does though create the potential for new and peculiar ways for the system to fail
2015-01-29T14:13:30 <Bosmon> In that there needs to be a way to distinguish between "something which is not here now but will be here later" and "something which is not here now and will never arrive"
2015-01-29T14:13:59 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes.. i think we have that problem with testing events too.. how can we test that something doesn\'t happen
2015-01-29T14:14:07 <Bosmon> Which you may remember is a similar issue to one which we face i) with your DataSource filter work, and ii) with the issue of rendering in general, and components which may or may not have "containers" etc.
2015-01-29T14:14:27 <Bosmon> Well.... it\'s really a fundamental issue related to how "time" works in general
2015-01-29T14:14:55 <Bosmon> A priori there\'s no "cut and dried" way of distinguishing between "later" and "never" unless you create definite time points in your workflow by which you expect something to have happened
2015-01-29T14:15:48 <Justin_o> Bosmon: sadly you\'re right, we can\'t change how time is implemented
2015-01-29T14:15:53 <Bosmon> :)
2015-01-29T14:16:02 <Bosmon> Well, we can\'t change that, but we can start to give it NAMES
2015-01-29T14:16:18 <Justin_o> Bosmon: and those artificial time points can be brittle
2015-01-29T14:16:25 <Bosmon> I imagine there will be a new lifecycle point corresponding to "the system has now loaded all the code that it is expected to find"
2015-01-29T14:16:35 * the-t-in-rtf joined the channel
2015-01-29T14:16:42 <Bosmon> Of course that is rather hard to define in a stable way
2015-01-29T14:17:10 <Bosmon> Since we don\'t control the code discovery process
2015-01-29T14:17:14 <Bosmon> At least we don\'t, in a browser
2015-01-29T14:17:24 <Bosmon> We hope in the end to control it at least in node.js
2015-01-29T14:17:35 <Justin_o> right

2015-01-29T15:01:13 <jhung> Do you have time this morning to chat about next steps for P4A Developer Space?
2015-01-29T15:01:30 <Sepideh> yes, for sure
2015-01-29T15:01:42 <Sepideh> what time do you want to meet?
2015-01-29T15:02:05 <jhung> 11a okay for you Sepideh?
2015-01-29T15:02:17 <Sepideh> sounds good.

2015-01-29T15:03:15 <jhung> thanks Sepideh. danaayotte I was just talking to Sepideh. We\'re going to meet at 11a to talk about P4A Dspace. Join us if you\'re free.
2015-01-29T15:05:23 <michelled> jhung: I\'d like to join that as well
2015-01-29T15:05:37 <jhung> michelled: sure!
2015-01-29T15:05:56 <jhung> maybe Justin_o if you have time.
2015-01-29T15:07:37 <Justin_o> jhung: sure i\'ll listen in
2015-01-29T15:07:49 <jhung> thanks

2015-01-29T15:28:29 <Justin_o> Bosmon: is there a way to make the IoC testing framework wait longer than 500ms for an event?
2015-01-29T15:29:14 <Bosmon> Hi Justin_o - yes
2015-01-29T15:29:19 <Bosmon> Although actually it waits 5000ms = 5 seconds
2015-01-29T15:29:20 <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/tests/test-core/utils/js/IoCTestUtils.js#L29
2015-01-29T15:29:28 <Bosmon> You just need to override this option in your top-level testEnvironment
2015-01-29T15:29:42 <Bosmon> I\'d be a little worried if you have an event which legitimately takes longer than 5 seconds to arrive
2015-01-29T15:29:44 <Bosmon> What is it?
2015-01-29T15:30:46 <Justin_o> some text that is being read
2015-01-29T15:31:08 <Justin_o> i hope it isn\'t taking 5 seconds though but it could since it has to parse the the DOM and the actually say it
2015-01-29T15:31:15 <Bosmon> Oh I see
2015-01-29T15:31:17 <Bosmon> spoken aloud
2015-01-29T15:31:18 <Bosmon> Interesting
2015-01-29T15:31:23 <Justin_o> yes
2015-01-29T15:31:25 <Bosmon> Ok yes, feel free to use this configuration open
2015-01-29T15:31:27 <Bosmon> option
2015-01-29T15:31:47 <Justin_o> okay.. i\'ll see if shorter text helps.. could be an actual bug somewhere so i\'ll play around with things.. thanks for the pointer

2015-01-29T15:57:40 <cindyli> Bosmon: Justin_o and I had some chat yesterday regarding how to best use the prefs framework to implement the demo for the first discovery tool. its wireframe: http://wiki.fluidproject.org/download/attachments/40797428/First%20Discovery%20January%207%2015%20copy.pdf
2015-01-29T15:58:00 <cindyli> the difficult part that we think our prefs framework doesn\'t support yet is the navigation
2015-01-29T15:58:41 <cindyli> in this tool, only one panel get shown at a time. users can navigate around panels by using navigation bar or back / next buttons
2015-01-29T15:59:31 <cindyli> the ideal case is users can use the aux schema to define the order of panels and which navigation icon is associated with which panel
2015-01-29T16:00:41 <michelled> jhung: where are we meeting?
2015-01-29T16:01:31 <cindyli> those information can be passed and accessed at panel components level, but not the loader level that controls the communication of buttons, navigation bars and back/next buttons
2015-01-29T16:01:36 <Sepideh> michelled, I think we are gonna meet in the fluid standup
2015-01-29T16:04:07 <cindyli> Bosmon: what do you think? do we miss anything?
2015-01-29T16:11:50 <Justin_o> cindyli, michelled: I filed a pull request for the text to speech stuff https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/583
2015-01-29T16:11:54 <Justin_o> who should review that?
2015-01-29T16:14:22 <Justin_o> Bosmon: would you be able to review my pull request? ^

2015-01-29T17:22:09 <Sepideh> jhung: let\xe2\x80\x99s use this page to generate our usecases and personae. Later on we can modify the page\xe2\x80\x99s structure http://wiki.fluidproject.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=43024459
2015-01-29T17:26:32 <jhung> perfect Sepideh. Thanks!
2015-01-29T17:26:48 <jhung> anastasiac: you were mentioning something about namespace for the first discovery tool?
2015-01-29T17:28:56 <anastasiac> jhung, yes: we decided to use the \xe2\x80\x9cgpii\xe2\x80\x9d namespace for the FD tool. This means that all the selectors in the HTML and CSS need to change, from \xe2\x80\x9cfd-\xe2\x80\x9c to \xe2\x80\x9cgpii-\xe2\x80\x9c and from \xe2\x80\x9cfdc-\xe2\x80\x9c to \xe2\x80\x9cgpiic-\xe2\x80\x9c
2015-01-29T17:29:22 <anastasiac> Also, jhung, there was a request to move the \xe2\x80\x9cmute\xe2\x80\x9d button OUT of the prefsEditorContainer
2015-01-29T17:29:25 <jhung> ok got it. thanks anastasiac. Let me commit what I have. Have you made those changes?
2015-01-29T17:29:37 <anastasiac> no, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t, no time :-)
2015-01-29T17:29:45 <jhung> ok. I\'ll do that then.
2015-01-29T17:30:01 <jhung> ok to moving the mute button anastasiac.
2015-01-29T17:30:11 <anastasiac> thanks, jhung
2015-01-29T17:30:13 <jhung> But visually it stays where it is?
2015-01-29T17:31:44 <anastasiac> jhung, yes, visually it stays where it is
2015-01-29T17:31:51 <jhung> ok thanks

2015-01-29T18:17:33 <jhung> hi anastasiac, cindyli. I have an alternative to the progress element currently being used in the First Discovery tool. Is it okay to change this? Instead of <progress> I was going to use a CSS generated background colour that gets changed depending on the value of the input field.
2015-01-29T18:18:13 <jhung> The background would have the illusion of a volume level.
2015-01-29T18:18:48 <cindyli> sounds cool, jhung, no objection
2015-01-29T18:22:11 <anastasiac> jhung, when you say \xe2\x80\x9cCSS generated\xe2\x80\x9d, what do you mean?
2015-01-29T18:27:58 <jhung> it\'s a div with a background color that covers 100%. Then the background transparency (done through a background-gradient property) is moved. Thus we can give the illusion that a div is "fgoing up" or "going down" depending on the position of that transparency.
2015-01-29T18:27:59 <jhung> ^anastasiac
2015-01-29T18:28:34 <anastasiac> jhung, how will this work programmatically? What would the JS modify?

2015-01-29T18:29:31 * anastasiac joined the channel
2015-01-29T18:30:04 <jhung> the JS would modify the CSS anastasiac
2015-01-29T18:30:42 <anastasiac> jhung, it would add a class to the div? or set a specific style? what value would it change?
2015-01-29T18:31:12 <jhung> maybe easier to show you anastasiac?
2015-01-29T18:31:31 <anastasiac> sure, jhung
2015-01-29T18:32:29 <jhung> Let\'s use vidyo anastasiac.
2015-01-29T18:33:09 <anastasiac> all right, I\xe2\x80\x99m in your room, jhung

2015-01-29T13:04:06 <Bosmon> KASPARD DE LA TOP TOT DE LA APRES-MIDDI!!!
2015-01-29T13:04:10 <Bosmon> TROP TOT
2015-01-29T13:05:57 <kasparne_> Bonjour monseigneur docteur docteur Antvanique le Bass
2015-01-29T13:06:31 <kasparne_> We have a pull request: https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/304/files
2015-01-29T13:06:55 <Bosmon> I see it
2015-01-29T13:07:04 <Bosmon> We should just merge it
2015-01-29T13:07:08 <kasparne_> that involved a change in a production config (actually we have another one with adding a production config as well)
2015-01-29T13:07:13 <kasparne_> ok cool
2015-01-29T13:07:21 <kasparne_> and then wait with the testing part later?!
2015-01-29T13:07:30 <Bosmon> I mean, what can we do with changes to production config other than validate them in production
2015-01-29T13:07:31 <kasparne_> until we figure out how the hell to do it ;)
2015-01-29T13:07:35 <Bosmon> quite
2015-01-29T13:07:38 <kasparne_> cool
2015-01-29T13:08:19 <Bosmon> I mean that warning is still there next to it I see
2015-01-29T13:08:24 <Bosmon> So this is perfectly reasonable
2015-01-29T13:08:33 <kasparne_> cool
2015-01-29T13:09:23 <kasparne_> I\'ll add in the other production config as well (for installed GPII) along with a readme file
2015-01-29T13:09:38 <kasparne_> to the pull request, that is
2015-01-29T13:10:47 <kasparne_> thanks Bosmon
2015-01-29T13:38:39 <Bosmon> Hey Justin_o - look at this
2015-01-29T13:38:53 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf has been experimenting with integrated client + server tests using "ZZOMBBIE"
2015-01-29T13:38:55 <Bosmon> https://github.com/the-t-in-rtf/gpii-hb-helper/blob/master/src/tests/js/zombie-tests.js
2015-01-29T13:39:13 <Bosmon> This could be very useful for writing integrated fixtures against our OAuth interface, as well as many other use cases
2015-01-29T13:39:41 <Justin_o> Bosmon: that\'d be great.. i was just talking to simon about that earlier this week
2015-01-29T13:39:43 <Bosmon> Of course this doesn\'t take away the need to have decent client and server test fixtures issued separately :)
2015-01-29T13:39:44 <the-t-in-rtf> I will have another example in a few minutes that doesn\'t mix client-side and node-side tests.
2015-01-29T13:40:09 <Bosmon> But it plugs in a vital gap in our "integration testing" spectrum
2015-01-29T13:40:19 <Bosmon> As they say, "Fills a much-needed gap in the literature" : P
2015-01-29T13:42:13 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - you can just use "jqUnit.fail" on line 94
2015-01-29T13:42:22 <Bosmon> Rather than jqUnit.assertNull
2015-01-29T13:43:15 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yah.. this look really good.. we should make sure to let simon know about it too.. i think he\'ll be writing those tests for the Oauth2 work, and we should use this for the PMT/PCP integration tests too
2015-01-29T13:43:27 <Bosmon> Justin_o - absolutely
2015-01-29T13:43:29 <Justin_o> although i\'m not exactly sure where those should live since they are kind of separate from the rest of GPII right now
2015-01-29T13:43:31 <Bosmon> That is probably our most crucial use case
2015-01-29T13:43:41 <Bosmon> You may be aware that the PCP simply failed during our review last week
2015-01-29T13:43:47 <Justin_o> no
2015-01-29T13:43:50 <Bosmon> Since, as it turned out, it had never been tested
2015-01-29T13:43:50 <Justin_o> i didn\'t know about that
2015-01-29T13:43:57 <Justin_o> what happened?
2015-01-29T13:44:00 <Bosmon> It had to be removed from the demo scenario completely
2015-01-29T13:44:04 <Bosmon> Since it couldn\'t be made to work
2015-01-29T13:44:34 <Bosmon> The socket handling code, amongst others, was completely riddled with bugs
2015-01-29T13:44:39 <Justin_o> that\'s not good, but i believe it was sort of an extra piece, from what i recalled it was mentioned as being critical for the review so that could have been part of the problem.. i think most of the energy there was on the context stuff
2015-01-29T13:44:56 <Bosmon> Well, we managed to paper over it
2015-01-29T13:45:01 <Justin_o> that\'s good :)
2015-01-29T13:45:22 <Justin_o> the PCP was kind of an abrupt handoff  since we lost the resource who were working on it :(
2015-01-29T13:45:26 <Bosmon> It wasn\'t exactly "critical for the review" but the review did nonetheless require us to demonstrate all our deliverables
2015-01-29T13:45:40 <Bosmon> Yes
2015-01-29T13:45:55 <Bosmon> If he had been able to leave some test cases behind him, it might have been a bit less of a brutal handoff : P
2015-01-29T13:46:11 <Bosmon> Still, I think we will get some time to concentrate on our WebSockets infrastructure for Prosperity4All
2015-01-29T13:46:22 <Justin_o> Bosmon: but yah, lots of details to work out for PMT and PCP still, like where they live and how they are loaded and the integration is absolutely critical, so these tests would be awesome to ensure that
2015-01-29T13:46:39 <Justin_o> Bosmon: that\'s good
2015-01-29T13:46:41 <Bosmon> I had highlighted all of that code as a major risk and even tried to make a case for shelving WebSockets work completely until we had more time
2015-01-29T13:47:28 <Bosmon> Ah
2015-01-29T13:47:42 <Bosmon> The other crucial thing that the-t-in-rtf \'s ZOMBBIE could test is infuriating stuff like "CORS" support
2015-01-29T13:47:53 <Justin_o> really?
2015-01-29T13:48:00 <Bosmon> I insisted to yzen before he left that he write tests that this server implementation actually did anything that a client recognised
2015-01-29T13:48:01 <Justin_o> oh in the server because we can change the port?
2015-01-29T13:48:32 <Bosmon> It\'s all very well to verify that a server produces a certain set of headers to a certain request
2015-01-29T13:48:47 <Bosmon> but the point is that we need to know that they are the headers that the client actually plans to respond to : P
2015-01-29T13:48:53 <Bosmon> And we can\'t test that without actually having a client
2015-01-29T13:49:10 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes :) but do we know that for sure if we are testing with zombie since it isn\'t a real browser per se
2015-01-29T13:49:33 <the-t-in-rtf> @Bosmon: I want to have the error message displayed in the results, can jqUnit.fail() do that?
2015-01-29T13:50:01 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - yes, jqUnit.fail accepts a message just like all the other methods
2015-01-29T13:50:29 <Bosmon> Justin_o - ok, I see now
2015-01-29T13:50:31 <Bosmon> I hadn\'t realised this
2015-01-29T13:50:33 <the-t-in-rtf> Ah, so I would have to append the error to the message.  I guess I lazily liked that assertNotNull kept them separate.
2015-01-29T13:50:46 <Bosmon> I had assumed that zombie actually contained a real browser
2015-01-29T13:50:50 <Bosmon> That\'s awkward
2015-01-29T13:51:00 <Bosmon> It does at least support WebSockets though
2015-01-29T13:51:15 <Bosmon> Which was a big problem with things like "ghost", "phantom" etc.
2015-01-29T13:51:28 <Bosmon> They were based on such ancient back-level versions of their respective browsers that they had no usable HTML5 support
2015-01-29T13:53:25 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i didn\'t realize those didn\'t support HTML5
2015-01-29T13:53:44 <Bosmon> They were all based on versions of their browsers that were perhaps 3-5 years old
2015-01-29T13:53:59 <Bosmon> I found that they couldn\'t be used for issuing WebSockets fixtures
2015-01-29T13:54:16 <Bosmon> Which was another thing that paniced me when we were assessing our WebSockets situation back in August
2015-01-29T13:54:25 <Bosmon> We had no credible server-side tests
2015-01-29T13:54:33 <Bosmon> And it turned out we couldn\'t issue client-side tests either
2015-01-29T13:57:35 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I am starting work on abolishing the staticEnvironment today :)
2015-01-29T13:57:47 <Bosmon> It\'s great to be able to finally move the framework forward again
2015-01-29T13:58:14 <Justin_o> Bosmon: :)
2015-01-29T13:58:41 <Justin_o> Bosmon: how will the progressive enhancement stuff and page enhancer work
2015-01-29T13:58:57 * anvk joined the channel
2015-01-29T13:59:31 <Bosmon> Justin_o - they will just construct standard components :)
2015-01-29T13:59:46 <Bosmon> This will be a major change of architecture for the IoC system and all of infusion
2015-01-29T14:00:02 <Justin_o> Bosmon: how painful will it be?
2015-01-29T14:00:16 <Bosmon> Hopefully not painful at all... once it is finished
2015-01-29T14:00:17 <Bosmon> http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5249
2015-01-29T14:00:52 <Bosmon> The only user code that should need to change is anything that used to address the staticEnvironment
2015-01-29T14:01:08 <Bosmon> We\'ll need a bit of extra material within jqUnit that will prevent our test cases from endlessly accumulating components
2015-01-29T14:01:17 <Bosmon> But that shouldn\'t affect any user code
2015-01-29T14:01:48 <Bosmon> But in practice we have always had this leak
2015-01-29T14:01:50 <Bosmon> And we never noticed it
2015-01-29T14:03:37 * cindyli joined the channel
2015-01-29T14:03:44 * michelled joined the channel
2015-01-29T14:04:25 * the-t-in-rtf has quit
2015-01-29T14:04:50 <Justin_o> Bosmon: so all components that you create by directly invoking a component will actually be siblings of each other?
2015-01-29T14:05:10 <Justin_o> and visible to in each others IoC tree?
2015-01-29T14:06:24 <Bosmon> Justin_o - by default not visible
2015-01-29T14:06:36 <Bosmon> There will be a new grade called "fluid.resolveRoot" that you need to apply if you want them to become visible
2015-01-29T14:06:36 <Justin_o> that\'s the resolveRoot thing right, that makes it visible
2015-01-29T14:06:40 <Bosmon> yup
2015-01-29T14:06:58 <Justin_o> so the pageEnhancer would have that grade
2015-01-29T14:07:03 <Bosmon> Justin_o - right
2015-01-29T14:07:29 <Bosmon> Justin_o - although, to be clear - that visibility rule only applies to standard IoC expressions of the form {componentName}.thing
2015-01-29T14:07:35 <Justin_o> what happens with the "ginger world" stuff.. can i mention {pageEnhancer} before it has been instantiated to force it to be created?
2015-01-29T14:07:57 <Bosmon> We will create a new IoCSS term "/" which you can use to address anything from the root
2015-01-29T14:07:57 <Justin_o> Bosmon: that makes sense
2015-01-29T14:08:10 <Justin_o> cool
2015-01-29T14:08:39 <Bosmon> For example {/ viewComponent} will address ALL VIEWCOMPONENTS, EVERYWHERE : P
2015-01-29T14:09:23 <Justin_o> oh wow
2015-01-29T14:09:48 <Bosmon> Like the HUSNOCKS : P
2015-01-29T14:09:49 <Bosmon> http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Husnock
2015-01-29T14:09:50 <Justin_o> but only the ones in your own tree and external ones that have the resolveRoot great
2015-01-29T14:09:56 <Bosmon> No, ALL OF THEM!
2015-01-29T14:10:09 <Bosmon> Use of "/" will defeat the resolveRoot property
