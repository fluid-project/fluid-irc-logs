2015-07-01T10:15:01 <colinclark> jhernandez: I think ultimately the right way to build the new Chrome extension is with this: https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/runtime#method-connect
2015-07-01T10:15:29 <colinclark> It looks to me like extensions can mark themselves as externally connectable
2015-07-01T10:15:42 <colinclark> and then messages can be passed between content scripts and extensions
2015-07-01T10:16:03 <colinclark> we'd need to write a wrapper around it that web apps are expected to import
2015-07-01T10:19:16 <jhernandez> colinclark: yup
2015-07-01T10:45:04 <colinclark> options.components.requireRenderer.options.components.pageComponent.type
2015-07-01T10:45:20 <colinclark> dots, yo
2015-07-01T10:45:23 <colinclark> we have lots of dots

2015-07-01T13:31:42 <the-t-in-rtf> @all, we will be ordering lunch so that we can meet and eat shortly.
2015-07-01T13:31:56 <the-t-in-rtf> We are considering pizza, salad, etc.
2015-07-01T13:32:02 <the-t-in-rtf> please comment with requests for toppings, etc.
2015-07-01T13:32:23 <kasparnet> Bosmon, Bosmon7, colinclark, jhernandez, sgithens______
2015-07-01T13:32:33 <kasparnet> this is an option -> http://www.prontopizza3.dk/
2015-07-01T13:32:36 <kasparnet> right around the corner
2015-07-01T13:33:13 <kasparnet> if we want other stuff, there's the place we ate on sunday
2015-07-01T13:33:22 <kasparnet> or we could just find something on just-eat.dk
2015-07-01T13:33:34 <colinclark> zomg
2015-07-01T13:33:38 <colinclark> pizza's nice
2015-07-01T13:33:44 <the-t-in-rtf> The spinach pizzas look good, as does the veggie one.
2015-07-01T13:33:48 <colinclark> where did the two Bosmons go?
2015-07-01T13:34:03 <colinclark> I recognize this pizza place
2015-07-01T13:34:05 <the-t-in-rtf> for a walk, I think
2015-07-01T13:34:06 <colinclark> it's very close
2015-07-01T13:34:34 <the-t-in-rtf> The rucola salad and the pomodoro salad sound good.
2015-07-01T13:34:43 <the-t-in-rtf> Also, I would love a cola light.
2015-07-01T13:35:38 <colinclark> can a swedish speaker recommend a vegetarian pizza for sgithens______ and me?
2015-07-01T13:36:52 <colinclark> kasparnet: ^
2015-07-01T13:37:20 <the-t-in-rtf> I highlighted the two veggie options\xe2\x80\xa6 ;)
2015-07-01T13:37:40 <the-t-in-rtf> (after consultation with K)
2015-07-01T13:37:56 <the-t-in-rtf> For the meat eaters, the Torino sounds awesome
2015-07-01T13:38:20 <the-t-in-rtf> jalape\x0enos.
2015-07-01T13:38:54 <kasparnet> I can come down for some more translation to the non-meat crew
2015-07-01T13:39:04 <kasparnet> but are people ok with pizzas/sandwiches
2015-07-01T13:39:06 <kasparnet> ?*
2015-07-01T13:39:16 <kasparnet> if so, let's get an order in
2015-07-01T13:42:37 <the-t-in-rtf> We are talking about the two veggie options they have (spinach and gorgonzola, various veggies incl. artichoke), two meat, and two salads.
2015-07-01T13:43:11 <the-t-in-rtf> ah, there is a third option, with tomatoes, cheese and pesto.
