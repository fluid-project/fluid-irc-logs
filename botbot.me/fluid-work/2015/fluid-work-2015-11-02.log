b'2015-11-02T19:46:04 <Bosmon> By overriding these listeners with "fluid.identity"
2015-11-02T19:46:09 <clown> do I still have an account?  Should I sign up again?
2015-11-02T19:46:19 <Bosmon> And I\'ll improve the implementation in the meantime to make this more graceful
2015-11-02T19:47:49 <colinclark> I remember when these listeners were first introduced, along with the new priority system
2015-11-02T19:48:01 <Justin_o> Bosmon: cool thanks
2015-11-02T19:48:06 <Bosmon> Yes
2015-11-02T19:48:09 <Bosmon> At least they can now be removed
2015-11-02T19:49:09 <Justin_o> Bosmon: oh, before it only did JSON?
2015-11-02T19:49:21 <gtirloni> clown: i can\'t find your email address in the membership list. i think you should sign up again
2015-11-02T19:49:24 <Bosmon> Justin_o - it used to be all hardwired, yes
2015-11-02T19:49:43 <clown> gtirloni, okay.  thanks for looking

2015-11-02T20:46:06 <Justin_o> Bosmon: could you let avtar and I know when kettle, infusion, and etc. support node 4. Node inspector seems to want 0.11.13 or higher to run properly
2015-11-02T20:46:28 <Bosmon> Justin_o - they support them now
2015-11-02T20:46:40 <Justin_o> Bosmon: is that all in master already?
2015-11-02T20:46:44 <Bosmon> Infusion is
2015-11-02T20:46:47 <Bosmon> And Kettle is in my branch
2015-11-02T20:46:53 <Justin_o> oh okay, awesome
2015-11-02T20:46:59 <Justin_o> any idea about gpii-express?
2015-11-02T20:47:03 <Bosmon> But the version you are bound to already probably is new enough to support it
2015-11-02T20:47:03 <Justin_o> Bosmon: ^
2015-11-02T20:47:10 <Bosmon> Justin_o - that is a question for the-t-in-rtf
2015-11-02T20:47:18 <Justin_o> we\'re using 0.10.4 in the vm
2015-11-02T20:47:29 <Justin_o> my host is using a higher version
2015-11-02T20:49:25 <colinclark> I don\'t see any reason why you shouldn\'t be able to use at least 0.12.x, Justin_o
2015-11-02T20:50:10 <Bosmon> The only parts of our architecture that will break with 0.12.x are on Windows
2015-11-02T20:52:02 <colinclark> right
2015-11-02T20:54:53 <colinclark> It\'s nice that the-t-in-rtf has such a good test suite for gpii-express
2015-11-02T20:55:06 <colinclark> the tests, at least, run happily in Node 4.2.0

2015-11-02T21:05:21 <Justin_o> simonjb: https://github.com/node-inspector/node-inspector/issues/710#issuecomment-126274859
2015-11-02T21:10:01 <Justin_o> colinclark: ^
2015-11-02T21:10:42 <Bosmon> Justin_o - it shouldn\'t be necessary to run the processes in that arrangement
2015-11-02T21:10:55 <Bosmon> I imagine you should be able to run node-inspector from within the vagrant box rather than outisde
2015-11-02T21:11:23 <Bosmon> And then just run the browser on the outside
2015-11-02T21:12:37 <Bosmon> They do explicitly list "Remote debugging" amongst their "Cool stuff" after all : P
2015-11-02T21:13:14 <Bosmon> They just don\'t completely mean by it what we imagine - or rather, what it means for node.js itself
2015-11-02T21:13:21 <Bosmon> But it should still mean "effectively remote debugging"
2015-11-02T21:14:19 <Bosmon> There it is, explicitly: "Yes. Node Inspector must be running on the same machine, but your browser can be anywhere. Just make sure port 8080 is accessible."
2015-11-02T21:14:37 <Bosmon> Now you see why I wanted you to move off port 8080 :)
2015-11-02T21:15:14 <Justin_o> Bosmon: we tried that too, got this error Error: Cannot find module \'/usr/lib/node_modules/node-inspector/node_modules/v8-debug/build/debug/v0.5.4/node-v14-linux-x64/debug.node\'
2015-11-02T21:16:28 <Bosmon> Justin_o - my suspicion is that that will be an npm issue
2015-11-02T21:16:34 <Bosmon> But you should be able to get over it
2015-11-02T21:17:13 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i\'ll try to look into this again tomorrow, but if you have any ideas, please let me know
2015-11-02T21:17:15 <colinclark> Bosmon: Yeah, we discussed that
2015-11-02T21:17:22 <Bosmon> Justin_o: https://github.com/node-inspector/node-inspector/issues/678
2015-11-02T21:17:23 <colinclark> Running Chrome and node-inspector in the VM
2015-11-02T21:17:36 <colinclark> that will require us to download an X server and GNOME when provisioning the box
2015-11-02T21:17:38 <Bosmon> colinclark - Chrome outside the VM would be more helpful, I imagine
2015-11-02T21:17:39 <colinclark> which will make it slower
2015-11-02T21:17:42 <Bosmon> colinclark - see above
2015-11-02T21:18:55 <Bosmon> There seems to be reasonably clear reasons why node-inspector should be run on the same machine as node, since it needs to export some of node\'s code to the UI
2015-11-02T21:19:30 <Bosmon> But it should be no problem to run Chrome on the host OS as per our expected "external tools" dev model
2015-11-02T21:19:50 <Bosmon> Getting node-inspector installed correctly would be another incredibly valuable service that our Docker infrastructure would achieve :)
2015-11-02T21:20:15 <Bosmon> Er vagrant

2015-11-02T21:31:54 <simonjb> which I think is what we were doing?
2015-11-02T21:34:34 <avtar> simonjb: almost, except justin was running node-inspector in the vm as Bosmon described earlier
2015-11-02T21:35:41 <simonjb> avtar: like the second answer? http://stackoverflow.com/a/32066649
2015-11-02T21:37:31 <avtar> yup with that version of node as well
2015-11-02T22:18:27 <avtar> Bosmon, colinclark, Justin_o: exciting new development
2015-11-02T22:21:21 <avtar> we installed node-inspector in Justin_o\'s vm and then later upgraded node from 0.10.40 to 0.12.7 after seeing an error in the devtools console
2015-11-02T22:22:21 <avtar> also Justin_o\'s vm didn\'t have a c++ compiler installed and it looks like the node-inspector installation isn\'t performed correctly without a compiler even though the process doesn\'t error out
2015-11-02T22:22:43 <Bosmon> avtarr - amazing
2015-11-02T22:22:49 <avtar> installing a compiler, upgrading to node 0.12.7, and then installing node-inspector results in a working setup
2015-11-02T22:22:49 <Bosmon> And - does it actually.... .EXECUTE?
2015-11-02T22:22:53 <Bosmon> superb
2015-11-02T22:23:09 <Bosmon> And, it being VAGGRANT..... you can guarantee that NOONE FOLLOWING YOU NEED EVER SUFFER THIS HORROUR AGGAIN : P
2015-11-02T22:23:20 <avtar> yes
2015-11-02T22:23:36 <avtar> well
2015-11-02T22:23:59 <avtar> should we use a port that isn\'t 8080 for node-inspector?
2015-11-02T22:24:39 <Bosmon> I dunno.... I guess noone gets to see its startup message anyway, so it doesn\'t really matter if it doesn\'t customise it properly
2015-11-02T22:29:32 <avtar> port conflicts get managed by vagrant on the host side but in the vm it\'s a different story. node-inspector uses 8080 by default so that means another process in the vm can\'t use the same port
2015-11-02T22:29:37 <avtar> Bosmon ^
2015-11-02T22:30:53 <Bosmon> avtar - well, it would be slightly prudent to move that port, yes
2015-11-02T22:31:02 <Bosmon> Given you just have to do it once for all users

2015-11-02T19:40:26 <Justin_o> Bosmon: do you have some time to talk about kettle requests?
2015-11-02T19:40:49 <Bosmon> Hi there Justin_o
2015-11-02T19:41:11 <Justin_o> Bosmon: hello
2015-11-02T19:41:33 <Justin_o> i\'ve been having trouble getting the communication to the security server to work via a kettle datasource
2015-11-02T19:42:14 <Justin_o> i managed to track down the problem to a stray double quote, which was causing my client secret to be rejected
2015-11-02T19:42:28 <Bosmon> Justin_o - that\'s interesting
2015-11-02T19:42:29 <Justin_o> however, this stray quote seems to be the result of the kettle request machinery
2015-11-02T19:42:32 <Bosmon> Where is the quote?
2015-11-02T19:42:35 <Bosmon> Aha
2015-11-02T19:42:49 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I assume then that you didn\'t want the request body to be JSON-encoded
2015-11-02T19:43:08 <Justin_o> Bosmon: simonjb was helping me to debug this, it looks like what might be trying to stringify my string
2015-11-02T19:43:28 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes, i\'m sending something that uses this content type "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
2015-11-02T19:43:35 <Justin_o> and passing in a string as the body
2015-11-02T19:44:24 <Justin_o> from what we can tell with a makeshift server i\'ve implemented for debugging was that there server is receiving the body like "grant_type=client_credentials&scope=add_preferences&client_id=client_first_discovery&client_secret=client_secret_firstDiscovery"
2015-11-02T19:44:27 <Justin_o> instead of just grant_type=client_credentials&scope=add_preferences&client_id=client_first_discovery&client_secret=client_secret_firstDiscovery
2015-11-02T19:45:57 <Bosmon> Justin_o - what I suggest you do is inactivate the JSON processing of the dataSource
2015-11-02T19:45:57 <clown> gtirloni: hopefully quick question.  I requested my password from lists.gpii.net (the "Password reminder" section of http://lists.gpii.net/mailman/options/architecture).  I haven\'t received anything in about half an hour.
