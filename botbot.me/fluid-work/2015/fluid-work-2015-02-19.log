2015-02-19T21:08:52 <michelled> I suppose you could tweet it from fluid too
2015-02-19T21:10:16 <jhung> anastasiac, michelled - Justin_o merged my changes into master. Maybe get it published while I start on the next few tweaks?
2015-02-19T21:10:20 <michelled> anastasiac: I might have given jhung bad avice about updating the news article on the floe site to point to the new site - can you take a glance and see what makes sense?
2015-02-19T21:10:38 <michelled> basically we just want to guide people from the front page of floe to the sprint site
2015-02-19T21:11:00 <jhung> currently there's nothing on the main site leading to the sprint page.
2015-02-19T21:13:07 <anastasiac> it would be possible to update the news article to include a link to the site, and to update the \xe2\x80\x98blurb\xe2\x80\x99 at the bottom of the home page so that it includes the link\xe2\x80\xa6 but that would be at the bottom of th epage, michelled and jhung. Would that be ok? Other than that, I\xe2\x80\x99d appreciate design guidance.
2015-02-19T21:13:41 <jhung> looking now anastasiac
2015-02-19T21:13:54 <michelled> that seems fine to me, anastasiac
2015-02-19T21:15:11 <jhung> anastasiac: go with that for now. We can put something more obvious later when we have time.
2015-02-19T21:18:41 <michelled> jhung: the last thing is for tomorrow, but I don't want to forget. I need some help with compiling the resource list. I shared a google doc with you - could you help to fill it in? the information in there has been sent from different partners. I'm not certain all the links belong on a resources page, but I could be wrong. the ones that are clear, I've marked with a 'yes'. please mark other ones that you feel should be on as well as sta
2015-02-19T21:18:41 <michelled> to find URLs for the ones that are missing them and short descriptions,
2015-02-19T21:20:10 <jhung> ok I can help with that tomorrow michelled
2015-02-19T21:20:24 <michelled> thx jhung

2015-02-19T21:47:23 <jhung> to publish anastasiac, all I have to do is merge upstream/master to gh-pages branch and push to gh-pages branch, correct?

2015-02-19T17:43:52 <danaayotte> anastasiac, can you remind me if we came to any decision about having voice volume in the tool? I think we agreed we have to have volume adjustment, but that it's not a preference, it's just for the tool. Does that sound right?
2015-02-19T17:44:09 <danaayotte> Justin_o ^
2015-02-19T17:44:09 <anastasiac> danaayotte, yes, that sounds like what I remember
2015-02-19T17:44:21 <anastasiac> but danaayotte, that might not be technically possible
2015-02-19T17:44:42 <anastasiac> Justin_o can confirm, but I think the TTS engine we\xe2\x80\x99re working with doesn\xe2\x80\x99t support volume changes

2015-02-19T17:46:13 <Justin_o> anastasiac, danaayotte: it depends on the synthesizer. some support others don't. and for those that do, the range may be different
2015-02-19T17:46:34 * michelled has quit
2015-02-19T17:46:49 <anastasiac> Justin_o, do we have any control over \xe2\x80\x93 or at least knowledge of \xe2\x80\x93 the synthesizer?
2015-02-19T17:46:57 <Justin_o> the synthesizer depends on the platform and browser
2015-02-19T17:47:03 * michelled joined the channel
2015-02-19T17:47:48 <Justin_o> we can query the web speech api for a list of available synthesizers
2015-02-19T17:48:34 <Justin_o> but there is a bug with chrome where there is some delay before that list is available

2015-02-19T17:49:06 * michelled joined the channel
2015-02-19T17:49:26 <anastasiac> danaayotte, I suggest we just set the priority of a volume control to \xe2\x80\x9clow\xe2\x80\x9d given the bugs and issues, etc.
2015-02-19T17:49:51 <anastasiac> we can focus on other things that we know are critically important, like language and other preferences
2015-02-19T17:49:57 <danaayotte> sounds good anastasiac

2015-02-19T21:06:35 <michelled> when you get a chance, can you add the Floe logo to the bottom as well?
2015-02-19T21:06:51 <jhung> sure.
2015-02-19T21:07:17 <michelled> secondly, jhung, can you update the news item that mentions the sprint to link to the site?
2015-02-19T21:07:41 <jhung> gotcha.
2015-02-19T21:07:49 <michelled> it would be good to start pointing people to the site from the main Floe site
2015-02-19T21:08:21 <jhung> yeah. Anything else michelled?
2015-02-19T21:08:40 <michelled> anastasiac: when you have a few minutes, can you please write a news aritcle for IDI and IDRC that points to the new a11y sprint site?

2015-02-19T14:41:11 <simonjb> no, either is good for me
2015-02-19T14:42:50 <colinclark> Well, let\'s aim for after standup on Monday
2015-02-19T14:43:08 <simonjb> sounds good
2015-02-19T14:44:09 <colinclark> cool, thanks
2015-02-19T14:44:21 <danaayotte> sounds good colinclark simonjb
2015-02-19T14:44:27 <danaayotte> thanks
2015-02-19T14:46:34 <simonjb> colinclark, Bosmon: did you guys see this Lenovo story yet? http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/02/lenovo-pcs-ship-with-man-in-the-middle-adware-that-breaks-https-connections/
2015-02-19T14:47:05 <colinclark> I saw something about it on shaver\'s twitter account last night
2015-02-19T14:47:34 <colinclark> I guess it really does makes sense to always install a standard Windows fresh onto any OEM laptop
2015-02-19T14:47:49 <colinclark> I was pretty chagrined with all the, what do you call it...
2015-02-19T14:48:05 <colinclark> BoringWare that my Moonbook Pro shipped with from Lenovo
2015-02-19T14:48:14 <colinclark> useless antivirus software, plus all this other junk
2015-02-19T14:48:17 <colinclark> but I had no idea it was this bad
2015-02-19T14:49:58 <simonjb> I think there is more info to come out -- like on how many machines this Superfish adware was installed on -- but it\'s looking pretty bad
2015-02-19T14:50:28 <simonjb> and definitely more reason to always re-install your os when you buy a machine
2015-02-19T14:50:38 <colinclark> I should probably talk to Bert about getting a clean OS put on that Moonbook
2015-02-19T14:50:45 <colinclark> maybe it\'s time to upgrade to Windows 8.1 anyway
2015-02-19T14:50:52 <colinclark> since it\'s increasingly our GPII target
2015-02-19T14:51:42 <colinclark> Is this a typical thing, simonjb? Reinstalling the OS at purchase time?
2015-02-19T14:53:30 <simonjb> colinclark: I think it\'s typical in some environments, such as corporate, but not common, I would think, for "consumers"
2015-02-19T14:54:18 <colinclark> Monoculture or malware...
2015-02-19T14:54:28 <colinclark> such tough choices for consumers these days

2015-02-19T15:57:42 <Justin_o> jhung: okay, can you send me a link
2015-02-19T15:58:09 <Justin_o> danaayotte: I have a question about the workflow of the mute button and speak text adjuster
2015-02-19T15:59:02 <jhung> Justin_o: https://github.com/fluid-project/floeproject.org/pull/18
2015-02-19T16:00:20 <Justin_o> jhung: thanks
2015-02-19T16:00:30 <danaayotte> ok Justin_o. Still need to put in in the iteration plan too
2015-02-19T16:01:15 <danaayotte> I can do that now, or we can talk? or both
2015-02-19T16:01:21 <danaayotte> Justin_o^
2015-02-19T16:01:24 <Justin_o> danaayotte: thanks, that would be helpful. so my question is.. is it enough to just visit the speak text panel to prevent the mute button from affecting it anymore
2015-02-19T16:01:26 <Justin_o> ?
2015-02-19T16:03:12 <danaayotte> Justin_o: Yes. Once the user has made a selection on the voicing/speak text panel, muting/unmuting will not change their selection
2015-02-19T16:03:51 <danaayotte> ah you mean what if they visit it and don\'t make any selection right? it would still have to hold true
2015-02-19T16:04:02 <danaayotte> if they select next
2015-02-19T16:04:35 <danaayotte> because selecting next is a confirmation of that preference setting
2015-02-19T16:04:48 <danaayotte> so actually I guess the answer is no! :)
2015-02-19T16:04:53 <danaayotte> it\'s not enough to just visit the page
2015-02-19T16:05:16 * Bosmon8 joined the channel
2015-02-19T16:06:37 <danaayotte> does that answer your question Justin_o??
2015-02-19T16:07:17 <Justin_o> danaayotte: so if they hit back and then muted, and then hit next again they would see a different value?
2015-02-19T16:07:46 * the-t-in-rtf has quit
2015-02-19T16:07:56 * Bosmon7 has quit
2015-02-19T16:09:50 <danaayotte> yes Justin_o. if they haven\'t confirmed a selection yet, the default will change
2015-02-19T16:09:51 * kasparnet joined the channel
2015-02-19T16:13:07 <cindyli> Bosmon: the pull request for FLUID-5552 - https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/582 is ready for another review
2015-02-19T16:13:22 <cindyli> Bosmon or Bosmon8: ^
2015-02-19T16:13:51 <Justin_o> danaayotte: do you think that would be confusing? Especially since they won\'t be able to change it with the mute button later. It\'s probably an edge case, but just want to know what you think
2015-02-19T16:17:59 <danaayotte> Justin_o: it might be a little confusing, but the alternative would be to keep the default selection to Yes, which I think is worse. We will test it
2015-02-19T16:25:45 <Justin_o> danaayotte:  okay, thanks...

2015-02-19T16:49:18 <cindyli> danaayotte: if the user has made a selection on the voicing/speak text panel but hasn\'t clicked the next button, should the change on muting/unmuting still affect the panel selection?
2015-02-19T16:50:08 <danaayotte> cindyli, please take a look at the log - Justin_o and I just had this discussion
2015-02-19T16:50:24 <danaayotte> I\'m going to add the functionality to the iteration plan page shortly
2015-02-19T16:51:03 <Justin_o> danaayotte: i think cindyli means that while you\'re on the speak text panel, will muting and unmoving affect the panel.
2015-02-19T16:52:11 <danaayotte> ah sorry cindiyli Justin_o I see what you\'re asking
2015-02-19T16:52:16 <danaayotte> cindyli!
2015-02-19T16:53:16 <cindyli> thanks for the clarification, Justin_o ;)
2015-02-19T16:57:30 <cindyli> hi Bosmon or Bosmon8
2015-02-19T17:00:20 * slim_jim joined the channel
2015-02-19T17:00:36 <danaayotte> No, i don\'t think it should cindyli Justin_o.  In which case perhaps we should not have it affect the default at all. This way it would remain really clear that they are two different things. So in that case the default would always be yes, unless the user changes it. It\'s problematic for other reasons but I don\'t see a good way around it right now.  Any suggestions?
2015-02-19T17:00:47 <slim_jim> hey kasparnet
2015-02-19T17:05:27 <Justin_o> danaayotte: okay, so the mute button and speak text adjuster will not affect each other at all?
2015-02-19T17:07:27 <danaayotte> Justin_o: yes that would be true
2015-02-19T17:08:47 <Justin_o> danaayotte: okay, thanks.. lets start with that and if it needs changes later we can modify it
