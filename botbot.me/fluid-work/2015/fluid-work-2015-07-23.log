2015-07-23T13:11:14 <Justin_o> jessm: it seems that the P4A link on the fluidproject site is dead http://fluidproject.org/projects.html
2015-07-23T13:11:40 <Justin_o> do you know what the correct url should be? Is it this one http://gpii.net/Prosperity4All
2015-07-23T13:11:42 <jessm> Justin_o: that\xe2\x80\x99s not good!
2015-07-23T13:12:31 <jessm> Justin_o: either that or http://www.prosperity4all.eu/ is the main project site
2015-07-23T13:13:19 <Justin_o> jessm: thanks.. i\'ll see if i can file a pull request to fix that
2015-07-23T13:13:25 <Justin_o> and switch to the link you suggested
2015-07-23T13:14:36 <jessm> Justin_o: might not need a pull request \xe2\x80\x94 maybe just pull the trigger
2015-07-23T13:14:39 <jessm> broken links are :(
2015-07-23T13:15:02 <Justin_o> yah.. they are :(

2015-07-23T13:33:16 <jhung> Justin_o: yes. You\'d issue a pull request. Once merged someone runs the ghpages plugin from master. This should be documented in the readme.
2015-07-23T13:34:06 <Justin_o> jhung: okay.. so i can do that from my own branch.. or do i have to make a new clone directly from the project repo to do the ghpages deployment
2015-07-23T13:34:52 <jhung> It\'s the latter Justin_o. You clone directly from the project repo and run the ghpages command from there.
2015-07-23T13:38:10 <Justin_o> jhung: so the README says you need to change the url in the docpad.coffee.. is that actually needed?
2015-07-23T13:43:14 <jhung> Justin_o: it\'s been a while, but I think you do.
2015-07-23T13:44:35 <Justin_o> jhung: could you take a look at this pull request https://github.com/fluid-project/fluidproject.org/pull/6

2015-07-23T14:25:30 <anastasiac> Justin_o: I\xe2\x80\x99ve created some pull requests to minimize the infusion and vp files being used by the IDI site: https://github.com/inclusive-design/wordpress-fss-theme/pull/12, https://github.com/fluid-project/videoPlayer/pull/136 and https://github.com/inclusive-design/infusion-videoPlayer-wp-plugin/pull/6. Not sure who could review; they\xe2\x80\x99re pretty simple.
2015-07-23T14:26:06 <Justin_o> anastasiac: do we need to setup a wordpress instance to test that?
2015-07-23T14:26:27 <anastasiac> Justin_o: yes
2015-07-23T14:27:41 <Justin_o> anastasiac: i don\'t have wordpress on my machine.. i wonder if either jhung could review that part, or if I could just sit with you for that part. I could do the other parts of the review though
2015-07-23T14:30:03 <jhung> anastasiac - my wordpress isn\'t configured properly (something wrong with mySQL database). Could you two pair?
2015-07-23T14:30:52 <anastasiac> sure. any time, Justin_o. Maybe have a look at the pull requests first, then you can come with any questions.
2015-07-23T14:32:24 <Justin_o> anastasiac: sounds good
2015-07-23T14:34:57 <jhung> anastasiac, Justin_o: I created a pull request to update the README for the fluidproject.org. Hopefully the instructions are more clear. https://github.com/fluid-project/fluidproject.org/pull/7
