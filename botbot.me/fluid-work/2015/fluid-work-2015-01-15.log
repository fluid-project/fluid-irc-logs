2015-01-15T14:26:49 <Bosmon> hi there jessm
2015-01-15T14:26:52 <Bosmon> sorry autocomplete
2015-01-15T14:26:54 <Bosmon> Justin_o :)
2015-01-15T14:27:06 <jessm> oh :(
2015-01-15T14:29:05 <Justin_o> Bosmon: hello, sorry jessm
2015-01-15T14:29:19 <Justin_o> Bosmon: I have a couple questions related to filtering
2015-01-15T14:29:23 <Bosmon> It\'s ok jessm, I like to talk to you too :)
2015-01-15T14:29:32 <jessm> Bosmon: :)
2015-01-15T14:29:39 * yzen joined the channel
2015-01-15T14:30:04 <Bosmon> Also ZENE\'EVICH :)
2015-01-15T14:30:13 <Bosmon> yzen - how was your triumphant Birthday? : P
2015-01-15T14:30:35 <Justin_o> Bosmon: 1) for the privacy-flat.json file we have a key (lhs) "http://registry\\\\.gpii\\\\.net/common/invertColours"
2015-01-15T14:30:40 <yzen> heh pretty good :)
2015-01-15T14:31:12 <Justin_o> however this matches to two preferences.. or really the preference falls under two categories..
2015-01-15T14:31:15 <Bosmon> cool :)
2015-01-15T14:31:41 <Justin_o> "increase-size.magnifier.invert-colours" and "visual-styling.change-contrast.invert-colours"
2015-01-15T14:31:48 <Justin_o> is there a way to represent that in this file
2015-01-15T14:31:50 <Justin_o> ?
2015-01-15T14:31:56 <Bosmon> Justin_o - we\'ll need to pick just one of those
2015-01-15T14:32:09 <Bosmon> Presumably it appears in just one place in the UI
2015-01-15T14:32:28 <Justin_o> Bosmon: actually it appears no where in the UI :)
2015-01-15T14:32:37 <Bosmon> Justin_o - well ok, problem solved :)
2015-01-15T14:32:38 <Justin_o> at least not in terms of the security
2015-01-15T14:32:46 <Bosmon> As soon as it appears in one place in the UI, put it in that place in the ontology file
2015-01-15T14:33:10 <Justin_o> but it was already in the file so i assume it is used by one of the intregrations
2015-01-15T14:33:25 <Bosmon> As I mentioned yesterday, this ontology is used 100% for the benefit of your UI
2015-01-15T14:33:28 <Bosmon> Justin_o - assume nothing :)
2015-01-15T14:33:30 <Justin_o> so it would be picked up by having selected one of the parent preferences
2015-01-15T14:33:43 <Justin_o> okay :)
2015-01-15T14:33:58 <Justin_o> so i\'ll just delete it from the file completely...that would solve that problem
2015-01-15T14:34:01 <Bosmon> I just hacked the file together based on my "best guess" about what you might need
2015-01-15T14:34:08 <Justin_o> Bosmon: oh i see
2015-01-15T14:34:10 <Justin_o> okay.. thanks
2015-01-15T14:34:23 <Bosmon> Justin_o - you\'ll need to leave it in one place, otherwise the preference will never be transmitted to the user
2015-01-15T14:34:39 <Bosmon> If you\'re not sure where to put it, just leave it in the "uncategorized" tree for now
2015-01-15T14:34:49 <Bosmon> But to me the visual-styling tree seems like a natural place
2015-01-15T14:34:49 <Justin_o> okay
2015-01-15T14:35:20 <Justin_o> Bosmon: 2) is related to keyEcho and wordEcho for the mobile a11y integration
2015-01-15T14:36:45 <Justin_o> when we remove read-back (their parent) from the preferences selection in the privacy page, it still returns back the preference but with a value of "0"
2015-01-15T14:37:03 <Bosmon> Justin_o - this will be resulting from a fault in the solutions registry entry for that solution
2015-01-15T14:37:13 <Bosmon> I had worked with simonjb on Tuesday to remove a few of these
2015-01-15T14:37:30 <Bosmon> You should make sure that the "capabilitiesTransformation" entry for each setting makes no return when it is given no input
2015-01-15T14:37:57 <Justin_o> Bosmon: this thing? https://github.com/jobara/universal/blob/GPII-1066/testData/solutions/web.json#L379-L400
2015-01-15T14:38:16 <Bosmon> Justin_o exactly that thing, yes
2015-01-15T14:38:35 <Bosmon> You can ask cindyli1 for help in writing a better transformation rule
2015-01-15T14:38:39 <Bosmon> I suggest you use the valueMapper instead
2015-01-15T14:38:43 <Bosmon> Rather than nested conditionals
2015-01-15T14:39:08 <Bosmon> This has been the direction we have been drifting in in general with our relay rules - to try to make more use of the valueMapper rather than compound transforms
2015-01-15T14:39:30 <Justin_o> Bosmon: cool thanks
2015-01-15T14:39:36 <Justin_o> cindyli1: please help :)
2015-01-15T14:39:39 <Bosmon> You may remember similar issues coming up in our other projects, e.g. metadata editing etc.
2015-01-15T14:39:57 <cindyli1> looking into ...
2015-01-15T14:40:11 <Justin_o> cindyli1: we can pair up on it if you have time
2015-01-15T14:40:25 <cindyli1> sure, Justin_o
2015-01-15T14:40:41 <Bosmon> cindyli1 is now a master at writing transforms that don\'t return values when they don\'t need to, or returning special values representing no value when they need to : P
2015-01-15T14:41:17 * anastasiac joined the channel
2015-01-15T14:41:19 <Bosmon> One day we will produce a UI like this one https://www.regex101.com/
2015-01-15T14:41:29 <Bosmon> Which will help people in authoring their model transforms and explaining how they work
2015-01-15T14:41:47 <Bosmon> A UI like this one, only accessible :)
2015-01-15T14:44:14 <Justin_o> Bosmon: :) exactly
2015-01-15T14:44:48 <Bosmon> If I\'d had this tool 7 years ago, we wouldn\'t have had the debacle that we now have with our escaped EL parsing rules....
2015-01-15T14:45:05 <Bosmon> But at the time, "life was too short" to be spent writing regexps

2015-01-15T14:46:12 <Justin_o> simonjb: sent you a pull request for GPII-1066
2015-01-15T14:46:23 <cindyli1> Justin_o: where can i find the input structure for "access_commonprefs_editingkeyboardecho"?
2015-01-15T14:46:56 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i can\'t argue with that... they make my head hurt every time i come across one.
2015-01-15T14:47:29 <Justin_o> cindyli1: the simple answer to that is I have no idea
2015-01-15T14:47:34 <Bosmon> cindyli1 - you will have to deduce it from this transform :)
2015-01-15T14:50:13 <cindyli1> ah ha, more challenge, ah
2015-01-15T14:50:45 <Bosmon> Unfortunately our European partners do not have the same culture of writing test cases that we do

2015-01-15T18:10:20 <kasparne_> thanks for uploading it though
2015-01-15T18:13:19 <avtar> mediawiki seems to want 120w x 160h
2015-01-15T18:14:02 <avtar> resizing this image seems to squish things quite a bit so i\'m not sure if they\'re going to try something else
2015-01-15T18:14:38 <avtar> thanks for providing next week\'s schedule btw
2015-01-15T18:14:42 <avtar> that should work out fine
