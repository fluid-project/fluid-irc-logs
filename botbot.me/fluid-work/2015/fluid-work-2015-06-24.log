2015-06-24T13:44:51 <colinclark> the-t-in-rtf: Your modelized browser history state component is super awesome
2015-06-24T13:45:13 <colinclark> these are the kinds of components we should be including in Infusion as they bake
2015-06-24T13:47:04 <the-t-in-rtf> Thanks.  I namespaced it as "gpii.X", with the intention of moving it up when ready.
2015-06-24T13:47:27 <the-t-in-rtf> I have an open feature request for the CTR / PTD / WTF and will apply it there once I exercise it with the UL mileston.

2015-06-24T13:47:44 * jessm joined the channel
2015-06-24T13:48:00 <the-t-in-rtf> By that point it should be ready for review.
2015-06-24T13:48:19 <colinclark> it\'s really cool
2015-06-24T13:52:07 <the-t-in-rtf> In theory I just updated it to do as much as it can and no more in <= IE9 without throwing an errors, I will test once I wire it in to a real page.
2015-06-24T13:52:15 <the-t-in-rtf> any
2015-06-24T13:53:02 <Bosmon> For those following along, we\'re talking about ADTKINS new ChangeApplier-driven history handler committed at https://github.com/the-t-in-rtf/unified-listing/commit/b9b3bbf16f503ccc3a8d7832298ba1a6708a643a
2015-06-24T13:54:56 <the-t-in-rtf> I would point out that it\'s also transformation driven, i.e. you have total control over what is passed and what it\'s called at every stage.
2015-06-24T13:55:08 * danayo joined the channel
2015-06-24T13:55:42 <Bosmon> Well, this is pretty interesting
2015-06-24T13:58:36 <Bosmon> I\'m puzzled about the query string portion of the implementation
2015-06-24T13:58:39 <Bosmon> How is this meant to be used?
2015-06-24T13:59:23 <Bosmon> ah
2015-06-24T13:59:27 <Bosmon> I think I see
2015-06-24T13:59:34 <Bosmon> I\'m a bit of a pushState dinosaur, I\'m afrid
2015-06-24T13:59:37 <Bosmon> afraid
2015-06-24T14:00:07 <Bosmon> Such things were not to be trusted in 2009
2015-06-24T14:04:13 <the-t-in-rtf> That\'s one of the things I wanted feedback on, I\'m sure I reinvented at least one wheel in the query string handling.
2015-06-24T14:04:42 <Bosmon> Well, no wheels that we have committed anywhere in reviewed repositories
2015-06-24T14:05:03 <the-t-in-rtf> That\'s good, usually I just haven\'t found it yet.
2015-06-24T14:05:55 <Bosmon> I\'m a bit concerned about the special handling of "null" in your encoding, but I guess it\'s ok if we advertise that the state semantics of this component aren\'t quite the normal ones
2015-06-24T14:06:08 <Bosmon> Your current implementation will also corrupt boolean true and false by converting them into strings
2015-06-24T14:06:43 <the-t-in-rtf> Actually, it doesn\'t corrupt them, as they are run through JSON.parse on the other end
2015-06-24T14:07:15 <the-t-in-rtf> "true" as a string might be lost in a back and forth
2015-06-24T14:07:20 <Bosmon> Well ok then, it corrupts the strings "true" and "false" : P
2015-06-24T14:07:23 <the-t-in-rtf> yes
2015-06-24T14:07:31 <the-t-in-rtf> or maybe not.
2015-06-24T14:07:48 <the-t-in-rtf> I believe the use of JSON.stringify on the input handles that
2015-06-24T14:07:50 <Bosmon> Well, it\'s unavoidable, given your use of JSON parse
2015-06-24T14:07:53 <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. the strings have quotes
2015-06-24T14:08:05 <Bosmon> But you don\'t pass things which are already strings through JSON.stringify
2015-06-24T14:08:15 <Bosmon> So they lose one round of encoding
2015-06-24T14:08:22 <Bosmon> Still, I think your implementation is reasonable
2015-06-24T14:08:23 * murilocrivellari joined the channel
2015-06-24T14:08:35 <the-t-in-rtf> I can pass everything through JSON.stringify easily enough
2015-06-24T14:08:36 <Bosmon> People shouldn\'t necessarily expect arbitrary round-tripping of arbitrary JSON through query strings
2015-06-24T14:08:46 <Bosmon> Yes, but this would then make your query strings look peculiar
2015-06-24T14:09:00 <Bosmon> I think it might be better to just document the lossage which users can expect
2015-06-24T14:09:26 <the-t-in-rtf> sounds good.
2015-06-24T14:09:52 * lliskovoi joined the channel
2015-06-24T14:09:59 <the-t-in-rtf> I have also thought about making the information added to the query string "tiny" in some way, as larger models can result in very large URLs.
2015-06-24T14:10:02 <Bosmon> Which as far as I can see amounts to i) loss of any keys with an undefined value (which is perfectly consistent with JSON semantics), ii) loss of keys with a null value, and conversion of the strings "true" and "false" into booleans (which is not consistent with JSON)
2015-06-24T14:10:37 <the-t-in-rtf> OK, I will leave myself a TODO before I knock off.
2015-06-24T14:11:25 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - how could you make the information "tiny" without assistance from a persistent server-side component?
2015-06-24T14:12:02 <the-t-in-rtf> Well, I just mean compressing and decompressing it client side.
2015-06-24T14:12:58 <the-t-in-rtf> I can optionally make a server-side module that understands the syntax, but this component also handles parsing the initial query string
2015-06-24T14:13:32 * clown joined the channel
2015-06-24T14:16:23 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - I doubt you could compress it by very much
2015-06-24T14:16:34 <Bosmon> Since you have so few URL-safe characters to play with
2015-06-24T14:17:09 <Bosmon> I don\'t think it seems very urgent
2015-06-24T14:17:16 <Bosmon> Let\'s figure out how to render stuff first :)
2015-06-24T14:18:57 <the-t-in-rtf> Sounds good.
