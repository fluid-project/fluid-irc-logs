b'2015-07-28T19:15:48 <Justin_o> Bosmon: wondering if i could use the valueMapper to map some inputs to new values and leave others as is
2015-07-28T19:16:08 <Bosmon> Justin_o - can you give an example?
2015-07-28T19:16:46 <Justin_o> basically i want to do a transformation so that if an empty label is supplied to a data entry field, it will be switched to some default label
2015-07-28T19:19:24 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, you can do that with the valueMapper
2015-07-28T19:19:46 <Justin_o> Bosmon: great... :)
2015-07-28T19:19:49 <Justin_o> how do you do that?
2015-07-28T19:19:50 <Bosmon> Although it\'s a tad cumbersome - here\'s an example in the tests: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/tests/framework-tests/core/js/ModelTransformationTests.js#L1772
2015-07-28T19:20:07 <Bosmon> We never quite finished thinking about this, since we stopped implementing the "metadata editing tool" etc.
2015-07-28T19:20:13 <Bosmon> So this issue didn\'t get revisited yet
2015-07-28T19:20:39 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay
2015-07-28T19:21:31 <Justin_o> Bosmon: but i don\'t think mine is so complicated, in that the model looks like {value: Number, label: "", percentage: Number, total: Number}
2015-07-28T19:21:37 <Justin_o> at this point i only care about label
2015-07-28T19:21:49 <Bosmon> Justin_o - actually I think this doesn\'t do what you want
2015-07-28T19:22:01 <Bosmon> I think it would be better if you just implemented your own transform function that supplies the default value
2015-07-28T19:22:13 <Justin_o> so if label is a string that isn\'t empty it should be fine, if it is an empty string or undefined or something it should be converted to the default label
2015-07-28T19:22:32 <Justin_o> Bosmon: ah okay.. a freeTransform i guess
2015-07-28T19:22:40 <Bosmon> Justin_o - it also looks like this is an issue that would be better managed in the view layer
2015-07-28T19:22:49 <Bosmon> I don\'t think there\'s a particular value to having a concrete default value in the model
2015-07-28T19:23:11 <Bosmon> But perhaps that\'s what you are actually doing now
2015-07-28T19:23:12 <Justin_o> Bosmon: it becomes the label that is sent to the chart though, so it is a real model value
2015-07-28T19:23:17 <Bosmon> ok
2015-07-28T19:23:43 <Justin_o> otherwise i would have just used a placeholder and it would have been easier
2015-07-28T19:23:47 <Bosmon> It becomes quite subtle thinking of the difference between "models in persistence" and "models used for rendering"
2015-07-28T19:24:14 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes.. like the decimals digit thing
2015-07-28T19:24:16 <Bosmon> Yes
2015-07-28T19:24:26 <Justin_o> i\'ve put that in the rendering layer as you suggested
2015-07-28T19:24:28 <Justin_o> which made sense
2015-07-28T19:25:07 <Bosmon> It needn\'t be a freeTransform, since you can just write a proper transform just as easily - since you are writing it from scratch
2015-07-28T19:26:05 <Bosmon> https://github.com/amb26/infusion/commit/194850705c5dbebf56f423a4847868e2f5bdb1ea
2015-07-28T19:26:09 <Bosmon> You can see a nice small example here
2015-07-28T19:26:14 <Bosmon> I added a "stringTemplate" transform for the-t-in-rtf

2015-07-28T20:16:20 <Bosmon> In trying to merge it into my framework branch, I ran into the following oddity: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/tests/component-tests/textToSpeech/js/MockTTS.js#L59
2015-07-28T20:16:37 <Bosmon> It seems that as a result of some strange bug, it used to be valid to write "listener" as key within an invoker....

2015-07-28T20:25:09 <cindyli> Bosmon: my pull request to move prefs data to the specific "preferences" model path is ready for more reviews - https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/617
2015-07-28T20:25:25 <cindyli> just a little reminder :)
2015-07-28T20:27:45 <simonjb> michelled: this morning with Kasper, we were talking about adding a new JIRA for default privacy settings, to be used if a user does not have privacy settings for a solution and then we talked about removing that demo (6)
2015-07-28T20:28:07 <simonjb> michelled: I wanted to check where things are with that and if it is still work that we want
2015-07-28T20:28:29 <Bosmon> cindyli - I am very afraid of your pull request since it contains more updates to PrefsEditorTests : P
2015-07-28T20:28:42 <Bosmon> And I hate merging those against my giant branch since there are always really giant conflicts
2015-07-28T20:28:48 <Bosmon> But I guess it has to be done sooner or later
2015-07-28T20:29:11 <Bosmon> fluid-everyone - I\'ve updated my giant pull request branch with fixes for all the testing failure that seemed to be new regressions caused by the branch
2015-07-28T20:29:35 <Bosmon> My latest comment refers to JIRAs filed for the remaining issues that I think are out of scope
2015-07-28T20:29:45 <michelled> simonjb: I would say that adding a JIRA for it is a good idea, but we should prioritize it very low. We will be merging demo 5 and 6 tomorrow
2015-07-28T20:29:48 <Bosmon> Which just leaves anastasiac\'s observation about the template paths on the demo server which I\'m not sure about
2015-07-28T20:29:58 <michelled> simonjb: we\'ll pass it by you again once we have rewritten it
2015-07-28T20:30:01 <simonjb> thanks michelled
2015-07-28T20:30:03 <gtirloni> Bosmon, awesome! can you remind me of what\'s branch (or the PR\'s URL) so I may update the instance that is running it for the tests
2015-07-28T20:30:18 <cindyli> haha, i understand. Bosmon, let me know if there are things i could help for resolving conflicts
2015-07-28T20:30:19 * anastasiac has left the channel
2015-07-28T20:30:41 * anastasiac joined the channel
2015-07-28T20:30:42 <Bosmon> cindyli - very little, I guess I\'ll need to do it anyway since I understand what the changes in file structure are
2015-07-28T20:31:00 <Bosmon> But the files have diverged so far now that the merging just has be done by hand since the automatic merge output is senseless
2015-07-28T20:31:18 <cindyli> that\'s painful
2015-07-28T20:31:29 <Bosmon> anastasiac - I think I\'m ready to start work on the "smoke test ready VP" that we were talking over with michelled
2015-07-28T20:31:39 <michelled> yay!
2015-07-28T20:31:42 <anastasiac> yay!
2015-07-28T20:31:44 <Bosmon> Can you point me to which the branch is that holds the "most nearly working" copy of the VP?
2015-07-28T20:31:55 <anastasiac> hm
2015-07-28T20:32:36 <anastasiac> VP-297, Bosmon. Cindy has a branch, and I have one based on hers. Both are very out of date. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure they\xe2\x80\x99d be all that worth starting from.
2015-07-28T20:32:57 <Bosmon> anastasiac - surely they\'re more worth starting from than the trunk of VP
2015-07-28T20:33:11 * clown joined the channel
2015-07-28T20:33:23 <anastasiac> possibly \xe2\x80\x93\xc2\xa0that might depend on how different the current Infusion master is :-)
2015-07-28T20:33:27 * sepideh joined the channel
2015-07-28T20:33:43 <Bosmon> anastasiac - well, I think you had at least made a start on making the components modelRelay aware, right?
2015-07-28T20:34:27 <anastasiac> yes, Bosmon, iirc, cindy\xe2\x80\x99s branch started that, and I tried to bring her branch up to date with what was the latest Infusion at the time
2015-07-28T20:34:48 <Bosmon> anastasiac - ok, well that should be a far better starting point than trunk then
2015-07-28T20:36:19 <Bosmon> anastasiac - I see 5 varieties of VP-297 branch in your repo
2015-07-28T20:36:24 * kasparnet joined the channel
2015-07-28T20:36:29 <anastasiac> LOL
2015-07-28T20:36:31 <anastasiac> hang on
2015-07-28T20:39:08 <Bosmon> Oh wow.... this appears to be the branch that my current VP working copy is actually on :)
2015-07-28T20:39:37 <anastasiac> Bosmon, my VP-297-clean branch is probably the best of them
2015-07-28T20:39:37 <Bosmon> Well, one of them, at least
2015-07-28T20:39:40 <Bosmon> Yes
2015-07-28T20:40:04 <Bosmon> I narrowed down the choices to VP-297 and VP-297-clean .... as being the only two which had been updated more recently than my working copy :)
2015-07-28T20:40:50 <simonjb> michelled: I created the JIRA, should I add it to the year 4 script?
2015-07-28T20:40:59 <simonjb> under demo 6
2015-07-28T20:41:00 <simonjb> ?
2015-07-28T20:41:23 <michelled> sure, thx simonjb

2015-07-28T20:47:59 <Bosmon> As a quick question to anyone, is there a simple way I can stop a grunt build finishing up with a "clean"?
2015-07-28T20:48:17 * jhung1 has quit
2015-07-28T20:48:17 <colinclark> an Infusion grunt build, Bosmon?
2015-07-28T20:48:22 <Bosmon> colinclark - one of those, yes
2015-07-28T20:48:30 <colinclark> I found that annoying this weekend, too
2015-07-28T20:48:39 <colinclark> but I guess it was a petty sort of thing...
2015-07-28T20:48:43 <colinclark> I didn\'t want to have to unzip something :)
2015-07-28T20:49:52 <Bosmon> I guess I can just edit the Gruntfile
2015-07-28T20:50:02 <Bosmon> But I imagined there was some uber-slick way : P
2015-07-28T20:50:24 <Bosmon> I guess I only got a "build" directory because it crashed before

2015-07-28T14:38:06 <colinclark> kasparnet: Where are you guys meeting?
2015-07-28T14:38:12 <Bosmon> This is in 7 minutes?
2015-07-28T14:38:21 <Bosmon> Justin_o - is this the same D3 meeting that alanharnum referred to earlier?
2015-07-28T14:38:28 <alanharnum> no
2015-07-28T14:39:04 <alanharnum> the meeting Justin_o mentions is to review the desired interaction behaviour of the finished component with the designers
2015-07-28T14:40:14 <Justin_o> thanks alanharnum
2015-07-28T14:40:18 <Justin_o> Bosmon: ^^
2015-07-28T14:40:53 <Bosmon> Ok, we can have the D3 meeting later - does 12:00 ish work for you?
2015-07-28T14:41:46 <alanharnum> Bosmon: that works for me - Justin_o, cindyli?
2015-07-28T14:42:06 <Justin_o> alanharnum: sure
2015-07-28T14:42:14 <alanharnum> i don't think it will take long - we just want to validate initial approach we're thinking of taking
2015-07-28T14:42:16 <cindyli> no problem
2015-07-28T14:42:23 <alanharnum> ok cool, thanks Bosmon
2015-07-28T14:42:51 <Justin_o> Bosmon: left you a reply on the FLUID-5675 pull
2015-07-28T14:43:11 <Justin_o> basically i had updated the comment for that feature detection function, wondering if it is okay now.
2015-07-28T14:54:12 * sepideh has quit
2015-07-28T14:54:35 <Bosmon> Hi Justin_o - the new comment looks great
2015-07-28T14:55:18 <Bosmon> I think it could still be fleshed out with an extra sentences that states explicitly what the failure mode is - that is, that on such a platform without audio, the API fails through never firing the onStart event for speechSynthesis
