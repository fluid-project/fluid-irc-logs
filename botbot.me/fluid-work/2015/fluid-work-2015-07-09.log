2015-07-09T12:50:14 <Justin_o> jhung: do you know ^
2015-07-09T12:53:27 <cindyli> jhung: i issued a pull request that adds the js component for showing/hiding the side bar - https://github.com/jhung/doc-base/pull/1. let me know if there\'s anything you wanna adjust

2015-07-09T12:56:12 <cindyli> also, jhung, i notice the infusion lib in code-base repo still contains all js and json files. i know you are upgrading the infusion lib in this repo. you may wanna take the chance to delete files and folders mentioned in https://github.com/jhung/doc-base/blob/master/src/static/lib/infusion/Version.md

2015-07-09T13:21:45 <jhung> cindyli: yes. I will clean that directory up once I\'ve upgraded Infusion to the latest. And thanks for the Pull Req.
2015-07-09T13:22:34 <jhung> As for updating the website cindyli, we just need to deploy the contents of the ./out/ directory to the gh-pages branch.
2015-07-09T13:24:56 <jhung> cindyli: I can take a look at updating infusion docs now.
2015-07-09T13:25:35 <Justin_o> jhung: is that documented somewhere? if not maybe we should add a README to the repo or something
2015-07-09T13:25:56 <jhung> Justin_o: let me check the readme. If it isn\'t I\'ll put it in there.
2015-07-09T13:26:05 <Justin_o> jhung: thanks
2015-07-09T13:27:13 <jhung> oh, it already is in there Justin_o. The readme mentions using the gh-pages plugin which basically does what I mentioned above.
2015-07-09T13:27:28 <Justin_o> jhung: okay, great thanks... next time i should read it :)

2015-07-09T15:59:19 <colinclark> hey maozillah
2015-07-09T15:59:31 <colinclark> you were asking me off-channel about testing and template injection
2015-07-09T15:59:41 <colinclark> but here\'s a cool place to chat about it, since others might have ideas as well
2015-07-09T15:59:46 <maozillah> cool!
2015-07-09T15:59:51 <colinclark> what was your question again?
2015-07-09T16:00:06 <maozillah> Right now testing for UIO grabs a separate html test template file to run the tests on which requires the dev to copy/paste over the modified actual html files into the test template. What I\xe2\x80\x99m doing is injecting the actual html file directly into the test template file so people can bypass this step in the future
2015-07-09T16:00:34 <maozillah> wondering if what I\xe2\x80\x99m doing is actually valid or not in terms of best practices for testing
2015-07-09T16:15:12 <colinclark> maozillah: Do you have any examples of what you\'re doing, just so I understand more concretely?
2015-07-09T16:15:43 * avtar joined the channel
2015-07-09T16:16:20 <colinclark> If it helps any, when I was talking to avtar yesterday about test file inject, it was a pretty specific context--this Karma testing tool that we were looking at using
2015-07-09T16:16:36 <colinclark> which has a very "code first" mentality, in contrast to our general appreciation for the value of HTML markup
2015-07-09T16:16:59 <colinclark> so the issue there was that Karma\'s model involves you writing this JavaScript configuration file for it, specifying all your dependencies in a sort of convoluted way
2015-07-09T16:17:19 <colinclark> and then Karma automatically generates an HTML page with the tests and dependencies in it
2015-07-09T16:17:43 <colinclark> which doesn\'t make a ton of sense to anyone who is already using QUnit, since of course all our unit tests already have HTML pages that are used to run the tests
2015-07-09T16:17:59 <colinclark> they\'re simple, they\'re easy to understand, and they can package up test markup and the tests into one package
2015-07-09T16:18:17 <colinclark> whereas the Karma developers argued that any test markup you needed should always be programmatically generated, which seems a bit extreme to me
2015-07-09T16:18:33 <colinclark> especially since QUnit provides facilities for automatically cleaning up markup after each test run and things like this
2015-07-09T16:18:48 <colinclark> I guess maybe Karma just is based on some kind of Angular.js mentality of how things work
2015-07-09T16:19:18 <colinclark> based on what I saw avtar doing, I imaging debugging Karma-based tests would be a lot more complicated than plain old HTML tests
2015-07-09T16:19:25 <colinclark> so we\'re doing to ditch Karma and look at a few other tools
2015-07-09T16:19:40 <colinclark> anyway, all of this detail is to say that the issue may be orthogonal to what you\'re working on...
2015-07-09T16:19:47 <colinclark> but I\'d love to see an example so I understand better
2015-07-09T16:19:48 <colinclark> :)
2015-07-09T16:26:42 <maozillah> For sure. The original UIO panel tests run off of HTML pasted into a standard template e.g. \xe2\x80\x9c<div class="flc-textSize">
2015-07-09T16:26:43 <maozillah> // everything in here would consist of code for the text size panel
2015-07-09T16:26:43 <maozillah> </div>
2015-07-09T16:27:21 * clown joined the channel
2015-07-09T16:27:30 <maozillah> The test html markup and the actual panel markup are in two separate files
2015-07-09T16:28:31 <maozillah> the panel markup is seperated into multiple files for modularization, whereas the test markup file has all of the markup combined into one file for ease of testing (i assume)
2015-07-09T16:29:03 <maozillah> As a result, if changes are made to the actual UIO panels atm, the test markup needs to be manually updated
2015-07-09T16:29:30 <maozillah> so that the tests will test updates to the panel markup
2015-07-09T16:30:13 <maozillah> What i\xe2\x80\x99m doing is wiring the test markup so that the modular panel markup will be directly injected into the test markup page
2015-07-09T16:30:33 <maozillah> e.g.
2015-07-09T16:30:44 <maozillah> <div class="flc-textSize">
2015-07-09T16:30:45 <maozillah> // </div>
2015-07-09T16:31:04 <maozillah> everything will be injected inside the class as opposed to being manually copied in
2015-07-09T16:41:52 <colinclark> maozillah: That sounds pretty sensible to me, at first glance
2015-07-09T16:42:07 <maozillah> Cool :D
2015-07-09T16:42:13 <colinclark> Duplicating markup between the actual component and the unit test sounds, as you rightly point out, pretty brittle and hard to maintain
2015-07-09T16:42:29 <colinclark> duplication is the worst, pretty much everywhere :)
2015-07-09T16:42:37 <maozillah> Ya, I was getting tired of copying and pasting as well

2015-07-09T17:16:19 <danayo> hi jhung, i\'ve added the contrast theme hover styling for some links that were added to the Outside-in site re: https://github.com/inclusive-design/outside-in/pull/7.  is there any way I can manually apply the contrast themes so I can check to see if it looks right?
2015-07-09T17:17:48 <danayo> (haven\'t committed my changes yet jhung(
2015-07-09T17:25:35 <jhung> Yes danayo. For example, you can add fl-theme-wb to the class in the <body> element.
2015-07-09T17:27:22 <jhung> This should apply the white-on-black theme. You can then change the class to fl-theme-bw / yb / by / lgdg for each of the ones you want to test.
2015-07-09T17:27:22 <jhung> Is that what you need danayo?
2015-07-09T17:28:24 <danayo> yes jhung, but i seem to have the markup wrong as I can\'t make it work
2015-07-09T17:28:44 <danayo> do you mean like this? <body class="fl-theme-wb">
2015-07-09T17:29:24 <jhung> yes danayo.
2015-07-09T17:29:48 <jhung> UIO on outside-in does the same thing. It just adds the appropriate class to the body element.
2015-07-09T17:30:25 <danayo> i can\'t seem to make it work tho
2015-07-09T17:30:28 <jhung> (yes, I just trivialized UIO. :D)
2015-07-09T17:30:41 <jhung> want to Vidyo and you can show me danayo?
2015-07-09T17:31:13 <danayo> sure

2015-07-09T20:03:04 <danayo> simonjb: if I have an open pull request, then make more changes and commit them to the same branch, how do I include these new changes in the existing pull request? or should I create a new pull request and/or cancel the first one (although I can\'t seem figure out how to do that...)
2015-07-09T20:09:48 <danayo> or jhung? ^

2015-07-09T20:10:55 <jhung> There shouldn\'t be any need to do anything aside from pushing to your repository on your end.
2015-07-09T20:11:57 <danayo> thanks jhung - it\'s just that the new commit doesn\'t show up in the pull request for some reason
