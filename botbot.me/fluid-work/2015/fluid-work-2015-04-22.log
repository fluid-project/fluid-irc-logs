b'2015-04-22T18:29:45 <Justin_o> but i\'m getting "" back
2015-04-22T18:29:50 <Justin_o> hmm.. could be something else then
2015-04-22T18:29:56 <Bosmon> Well, you must be doing something to put it there :)
2015-04-22T18:30:01 <Justin_o> i\'ll look into it more tomorrow.
2015-04-22T18:30:02 <Justin_o> :(
2015-04-22T18:30:03 <Justin_o> probably
2015-04-22T18:30:21 <Bosmon> I think it\'s an unlikely-seeming bug if it was in the relay system, since there\'d be no reason for it to choose that value over any other
2015-04-22T18:30:37 <Bosmon> But "" often results from UI components such as HTML input fields
2015-04-22T18:31:07 <Justin_o> fluid-everyone: the community meeting today will be on infusion framework changes... for those local it will be in the lab space, for those remote it will be in the standup vidyo room
2015-04-22T18:31:30 <colinclark> Justin_o: A session led by Bosmon?
2015-04-22T18:31:35 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i think it might be related to how i\'m doing a comparison.. trying to get a boolean value..
2015-04-22T18:31:37 <Justin_o> colinclark: yes
2015-04-22T18:31:40 <colinclark> wow
2015-04-22T18:31:46 <colinclark> i\'ll try to join with kasparnet for a few minutes
2015-04-22T18:31:50 <Bosmon> Oh cool
2015-04-22T18:31:51 <colinclark> but we\'re getting pretty hungry
2015-04-22T18:31:55 <Bosmon> Cheers, colinclark
2015-04-22T18:31:57 <colinclark> and tired from the review rehearsal meetings today
2015-04-22T18:32:06 <Bosmon> Well, I\'ll try to give the main headlines briefly at the start :)
2015-04-22T18:32:10 <Justin_o> colinclark: i think Bosmon has been writing docs too, so you should be covered if you miss portions
2015-04-22T18:32:19 <kasparnet> colinclark: what are you dragging me into, you bastard
2015-04-22T18:32:28 <Bosmon> I guess I\'ll need to leave this docu work where it is... still not QUITE finished with documenting the new ContextAwareness

2015-04-22T18:46:31 <Bosmon> fluid.component is the new standard "plain component"
2015-04-22T18:47:31 <Bosmon> Now only 4 standard framework grades: fluid.component, fluid.modelComponent, fluid.viewComponent, and fluid.rendererComponent
2015-04-22T18:47:48 <Bosmon> Lots of obsolete syntax is gone: Such as @n for arguments, and COMPONENT_OPTIONS
2015-04-22T18:47:52 * yzen_ joined the channel
2015-04-22T18:48:16 <Bosmon> fluid.initSubcomponent and the ability to manually instantiate components

2015-04-22T18:57:26 <Bosmon> "returnedPath" is gone
2015-04-22T18:57:40 <Bosmon> New: improved capabilities in distributeOptions
2015-04-22T18:59:01 <Bosmon> Firstly, it can resolve upwards in the component tree as well as downwards, and in particular, it can resolve via the global root selector "/"
2015-04-22T19:01:16 <Bosmon> Secondly - distributions have namespaces, as well as taking priority from the distance in the tree the distribution travels
2015-04-22T19:01:23 <Bosmon> Thirdly - introduction of PRIORITIES

2015-04-22T20:00:52 <Bosmon> Unfortunately it doesn\'t do very much to speed development directly, but at least it clears all the decks
2015-04-22T20:01:11 <Bosmon> We should start to see our implementations get substantially simpler once we start to handle asynchrony properly
2015-04-22T20:01:20 <Bosmon> I\'d expect a lot of the code in the prefs framework to fall away

2015-04-22T17:11:26 <Bosmon> What is meant by "after the fact"
2015-04-22T17:11:37 * avtar has quit
2015-04-22T17:11:37 <Justin_o> Bosmon: the meeting is in 80 min
2015-04-22T17:11:42 <Bosmon> Oh great
2015-04-22T17:11:48 <Bosmon> Time for more docs :)
2015-04-22T17:11:51 <Justin_o> Bosmon: :)
2015-04-22T17:12:20 <Justin_o> Bosmon: in regards to my question, we have the assessment component hooked up via model relay to the input component.
2015-04-22T17:12:39 <Justin_o> Bosmon: but after the assessment happens it really isn\'t necessary and sometimes unwanted to continue assessing the values
2015-04-22T17:12:48 <Bosmon> What does it mean to "assess a value"?
2015-04-22T17:13:03 <Justin_o> since there are model relays and listeners hooked up to know what step of the workflow to proceed to based on the assessment
2015-04-22T17:13:49 <Justin_o> Bosmon: in this case it\'s very simple. it just checks if an inputed character is equivalent to a specified value. (i.e. @)
2015-04-22T17:14:26 <Justin_o> if the user enters an @ symbol we should move on to the the "you don\'t need assistance" state and if something else is entered it goes to the "would you like to try sticky keys" state
2015-04-22T17:15:23 <Bosmon> Justin_o - what I suggest in this case is that you destroy the component associated with the "assessor"
2015-04-22T17:15:36 <Bosmon> And if this isn\'t yet in a separate component, put it in one so it can be destroyed :)
2015-04-22T17:16:19 <Justin_o> Bosmon: it is
2015-04-22T17:16:29 <Justin_o> what\'s the best way to destroy a component these days?
2015-04-22T17:16:42 <Bosmon> Justin_o - same way as always
2015-04-22T17:16:46 <Justin_o> and will it take out all the model listeners, relays and etc. at the same time
2015-04-22T17:16:47 <Bosmon> Call that.destroy() on the component
2015-04-22T17:16:49 <Bosmon> Yes
2015-04-22T17:16:51 <Bosmon> They will all go
2015-04-22T17:16:53 <Justin_o> cool
2015-04-22T17:24:54 <Bosmon> Justin_o - of course, given one of the crucial abilities of the "new renderer" will be to "relay components into existence", it will naturally have to be able to correspondingly "relay them into nonexistence"
2015-04-22T17:25:43 <Justin_o> that\'s a lot of power
2015-04-22T17:26:05 <Bosmon> Yes
2015-04-22T17:26:12 <Bosmon> We will have to use it wisely :)
2015-04-22T17:26:29 <jhung> anastasiac: should the "Talking to the Server Using The afterMove Event" to-do document appear in the Table of Contents? If so, would it go under "Getting Started\xe2\x80\xa6"?
2015-04-22T17:26:48 <anastasiac> hm...
2015-04-22T17:28:29 <anastasiac> jhung, I\xe2\x80\x99m tempted to leave it out of the ToC altogether. It\xe2\x80\x99s rather out of context\xe2\x80\xa6 What do you think?
2015-04-22T17:30:28 <jhung> I\'m thinking the same anastasiac - leave it out. I think we need better groupings for the ToC anyway as Bosmon had suggested a few days ago. We\'ll address all of this then.
2015-04-22T17:30:40 <anastasiac> sounds good, jhung, thanks

2015-04-22T18:14:06 <anastasiac> thanks, jhung
2015-04-22T18:15:01 <anastasiac> jhung, I\xe2\x80\x99m getting \xe2\x80\x9cwarning: Highlight.js: Syntax highlight definition does not exist for language: stylus\xe2\x80\x9d
2015-04-22T18:15:52 <anastasiac> that\xe2\x80\x99s not because of your pull request, but would you have a minute to see about adding an alias to a language that is supported?
2015-04-22T18:15:56 <anastasiac> jhugn: ^
2015-04-22T18:16:14 <jhung> let me look into that anastasiac
2015-04-22T18:16:20 <anastasiac> thanks!

2015-04-22T18:22:17 <jhung> anastasiac: did that highlight.js error only start appearing after my pull request/? I don\'t recall seeing it before.
2015-04-22T18:22:29 <jhung> I did merge an update from master though\xe2\x80\xa6
2015-04-22T18:26:40 * Jess_ has quit
2015-04-22T18:26:48 <anastasiac> jhung, it came from your merge from master, it was in another branch
2015-04-22T18:26:56 <anastasiac> we just missed it then
2015-04-22T18:27:10 <anastasiac> jhung, one more tiny comment on your pull request
2015-04-22T18:28:51 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i\'m finding that through the model relay i\'m getting "" for values that were undefined
2015-04-22T18:28:54 <Justin_o> is that expected
2015-04-22T18:29:10 <Bosmon> Justin_o - it isn\'t
2015-04-22T18:29:19 <Bosmon> But undefined values cannot be relayed
2015-04-22T18:29:31 <Bosmon> Any attempt to relay undefined will just leave the original value unchanged
2015-04-22T18:29:37 <Bosmon> Only valid JSON values can pass through the relay system
2015-04-22T18:29:38 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes, that\'s what i\'d want
