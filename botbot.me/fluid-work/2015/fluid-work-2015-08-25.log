2015-08-25T14:41:44 <anastasiac> colinclark: thanks for your feedback on the Prefs Framework tutorial, it\xe2\x80\x99s really helpful. I have one big outstanding question in my mind: Who is the target audience for this? Would it be a newbie like Kaye, or an experienced developer like Alan? Should we assume knowledge of Infusion in general, or not?
2015-08-25T14:45:07 <colinclark> It will be a skilled developer
2015-08-25T14:45:12 <colinclark> not a newbie like Kaye
2015-08-25T14:45:24 <colinclark> Assume knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, CSS
2015-08-25T14:45:52 <colinclark> and probably familiarity with other frameworks like Angular or Polymer
2015-08-25T14:46:04 <colinclark> anastasiac: ^
2015-08-25T14:46:18 <colinclark> Kaye\'s thinking more from a beginner\'s perspective
2015-08-25T14:46:39 <colinclark> but I sort of read between the lines of her feedback to extrapolate an approach...
2015-08-25T14:46:47 <anastasiac> thanks, colinclark, that\xe2\x80\x99s what I was thinking \xe2\x80\x93\xc2\xa0more of a skilled developer.
2015-08-25T14:46:56 <anastasiac> and yes, her insights are still very valueable
2015-08-25T14:47:06 <colinclark> show a thing, then describe the thing and have the tutorialee add to it
2015-08-25T14:47:19 * michelled joined the channel
2015-08-25T14:47:35 <anastasiac> so the question still remains: should this tutorial also teach Infusion? or can we assume they understand things like \xe2\x80\x9cgrades\xe2\x80\x9d?
2015-08-25T14:49:40 <anastasiac> I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking we assume understaning of Infusion, but include lots of links.
2015-08-25T14:49:50 <anastasiac> What do you think, colinclark?
2015-08-25T14:50:14 <colinclark> I think it will need to teach grades
2015-08-25T14:50:41 <anastasiac> so, assume \xe2\x80\x9cnew to Infusion in general\xe2\x80\x9d...
2015-08-25T14:50:50 <colinclark> yes
2015-08-25T14:50:52 <colinclark> but it should do so by example
2015-08-25T14:51:18 <anastasiac> yes
2015-08-25T14:51:28 <anastasiac> ok, thanks, that\xe2\x80\x99s very helpful
2015-08-25T14:53:52 <alanharnum> I will say as an experienced developer that having an introduction to the Infusion concepts and a working example as you go along is very valuable even if you aren\'t a beginner
2015-08-25T14:54:46 <alanharnum> at least for me, i find it easiest when i\'m learning a new framework or language to have a working example that evolves as I read through the concepts
2015-08-25T14:55:09 <anastasiac> alanharnum: just to make sure I\xe2\x80\x99m understanding: You\xe2\x80\x99re thinking of an up-front intro to Infusion concepts, before diving into the actual tutorial? And starting off with working code as opposed to building the code through the tutorial?
2015-08-25T14:56:32 <alanharnum> anastiac: yeah - I think the "Infusion Concepts You Need to Understand" is a good starting point for this.
2015-08-25T14:56:56 <colinclark> I was advocating for something even more direct, I think...
2015-08-25T14:57:16 <colinclark> Start with code and explain Infusion concepts from a particular instance of Infusion code, if you see what I mean
2015-08-25T14:57:27 <alanharnum> yup I would agree with that 100%
2015-08-25T14:57:57 <alanharnum> a working basic example to start, something more complex than "Hello World"
2015-08-25T14:58:15 <alanharnum> then broken down line by line to explain the infusion concepts from that particular instance
2015-08-25T14:58:34 <anastasiac> so perhaps, in the case of the Prefs Framework, a prefs editor that include a single preference? Then the tutorial could add more prefs...
2015-08-25T14:58:45 <alanharnum> based on my own still incomplete learning of infusion, doing that with cindyli & Justin_o was what made me start to grasp the concepts
2015-08-25T14:58:48 <anastasiac> of different forms and increasing complexity
2015-08-25T14:58:53 <alanharnum> yeah exactly
2015-08-25T14:58:59 <anastasiac> cool
2015-08-25T14:59:27 <alanharnum> cumulative introduction of concepts / increasing complexity, building on the originating working example
2015-08-25T15:01:03 <alanharnum> if the target audience for this is "experienced JS/CSS/HTML developer, familiar with other JS frameworks, not familiar with Infusion" my best contribution to this might be to just work through the tutorial, since that basically describes me :P
2015-08-25T15:01:35 * clown joined the channel
2015-08-25T15:01:42 <alanharnum> though i have a particular programmer learning style that I think is somewhat distinct, so i don\'t want to skew this too entirely towards my own preferences
2015-08-25T15:05:49 <alanharnum> this is interestesting as commentary on programmer learning styles: http://blog.melchua.com/2014/08/12/learning-styles-for-programmers-activereflective/
2015-08-25T15:09:58 <anastasiac> neat article, alanharnum, thanks. I\xe2\x80\x99m definitely toward the \xe2\x80\x9cactive\xe2\x80\x9d end of the spectrum myself.
