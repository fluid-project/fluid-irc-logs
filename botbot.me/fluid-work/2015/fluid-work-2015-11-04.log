2015-11-04T14:08:36 <Bosmon> Hi anastasiac - re your comment on https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5489
2015-11-04T14:08:39 <Bosmon> Which is the "docs issue"?
2015-11-04T14:10:02 <anastasiac> ah, sorry for the lack of clarity, Bosmon, I am just a bit confused
2015-11-04T14:10:07 <anastasiac> There was this docs change: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/pull/29
2015-11-04T14:10:31 <anastasiac> this wiki page implied that the docs change was related to the code change: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Infusion+Documentation+Plan
2015-11-04T14:10:33 * jessm joined the channel
2015-11-04T14:10:55 <anastasiac> I\xe2\x80\x99m just trying to straighten out in my head what\xe2\x80\x99s going on, and determine if there\xe2\x80\x99s anything that needs to be done wrt docs, Bosmon
2015-11-04T14:11:03 <Bosmon> Oh yes
2015-11-04T14:11:05 <Bosmon> The docs should be fine
2015-11-04T14:11:36 <Bosmon> I guess for that docs pull, I had just cast around for the nearest issue I could find that most closely described the ChangeApplier updates
2015-11-04T14:11:42 <Bosmon> But that one perhaps wasn\'t the best choice
2015-11-04T14:12:09 <Bosmon> Well ok
2015-11-04T14:12:15 <Bosmon> I guess it is the correct issue
2015-11-04T14:12:21 <Bosmon> It\'s just a shame that the closely related work has stalled
2015-11-04T14:12:32 <Bosmon> Which makes it hard to disentangle which work is done and which is not
2015-11-04T14:13:40 <Bosmon> I guess I\'ll close, the description is clear enough
2015-11-04T14:21:27 <anastasiac> thanks, Bosmon. I\xe2\x80\x99ll make a note on the docs planning page

2015-11-04T15:19:48 <cindyli> anastasiac: both Justin and I are working on the integration. Justin is working on the server side, i think this is his latest branch - https://github.com/jobara/first-discovery-server/tree/FLOE-430
2015-11-04T15:20:54 <cindyli> anastasiac: i\'m working on the client side (first discovery tool). the latest is in the master. today i\'ll be starting on another client JIRA https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-1490
2015-11-04T15:21:24 <anastasiac> ah, ok, so master has the latest changes. Ok, thanks, cindyli

2015-11-04T15:32:55 <colinclark> but sgithens is your best bet for all the details about it
2015-11-04T15:37:15 <alanharnum> anastasiac: we used the installer to configure a Windows 8.1 demo box
2015-11-04T15:37:34 <alanharnum> anastasiac: I have some emails and a few notes, but second colinclark that sgithens would be the best source of info
2015-11-04T15:39:38 <anastasiac> alanharnum, do you have a link to where I can download the installer

2015-11-04T15:43:57 <alanharnum> anastasiac: yeah one second - i\'ll PM you a link to some notes i have in a secret gist
2015-11-04T15:44:06 <anastasiac> :-)
2015-11-04T15:44:26 * jhung joined the channel
2015-11-04T15:58:19 <jhung> cindyli, anastasiac - do any of you have admin rights to Fluid-project on github? I would like to transfer docs-core and docs-template.
2015-11-04T15:59:37 <cindyli> jhung: i don\'t think i have admin access. Bosmon and colinclark might have
2015-11-04T15:59:52 <anastasiac> jhung: it looks like Bosmon, colinclark and Justin_o are the \xe2\x80\x9cowners\xe2\x80\x9d of fluid-project
2015-11-04T15:59:59 <anastasiac> so it will likely have to be one of them
2015-11-04T16:01:39 <jhung> Ok. It seems you can only transfer repos to organizations where you have admin access. So I think the process would be I transfer ownership of docs-core and docs-template to their user accounts. Then they will transfer ownership to fluid-project.
2015-11-04T16:08:36 <anastasiac> colinclark: in your email about the GPII links, you mentioned that the GPII docs are hosted on github. Do you have a link to that?
2015-11-04T16:09:16 <anastasiac> I\xe2\x80\x99m not having luck finding it
2015-11-04T16:12:19 <anastasiac> amatas, do you have a link to where the GPII docs are hosted on github?
2015-11-04T16:19:01 <alanharnum> anastasiac: I usually go to https://wiki.gpii.net/w/Main_Page for GPII docs
2015-11-04T16:19:19 <alanharnum> not sure if that\'s what you\'re looking for
2015-11-04T16:19:51 <anastasiac> thanks, alanharnum. They have markdown docs at https://github.com/GPII/universal/tree/master/documentation which are apparently deployed through gh-pages somewhere. I\xe2\x80\x99m looking for that deployment
2015-11-04T16:21:09 <gtirloni> anastasiac: they don\'t seem to have a gh-pages branch so i\'m not sure they are actually using github pages
2015-11-04T16:22:02 <anastasiac> yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99m confused, since both colinclark and amatas have mentioned gh-pages, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t find anything
2015-11-04T16:22:47 <anastasiac> ah, ok, maybe I\xe2\x80\x99m wrong\xe2\x80\xa6 I think I mis-read an email from colinclark.
2015-11-04T16:22:49 <colinclark> I\'m not sure I have mentioned gh-pages in regards to the GPII, no
2015-11-04T16:22:52 <colinclark> :)
2015-11-04T16:23:04 <Bosmon> anastasiac - I think you are misremembering my comment from last night, about our main infusion docs
2015-11-04T16:23:08 <Bosmon> Which are indeed on gh-pages
2015-11-04T16:23:11 <colinclark> As far as I know, the GPII documentation in universal are just there in the repository
2015-11-04T16:23:17 <anastasiac> no, colinclark, I just misread your email comment.
2015-11-04T16:23:20 <anastasiac> sorry for all the confusion
2015-11-04T16:23:46 <Bosmon> cindyli - I\'ve given a round of feedback for the docs-first-discovery pull
2015-11-04T16:24:11 <cindyli> that\'s great. thanks, Bosmon
2015-11-04T16:24:59 <cindyli> anastasiac: i guess you\'ve seen Bosmon\'s comments for the docs-first-discovery pull
2015-11-04T16:26:26 <anastasiac> that\xe2\x80\x99s next on my to-do list, cindyli and Bosmon, thanks
2015-11-04T16:29:52 <avtar> Bosmon, colinclark, jhernandez, kasparnet, or anyone else: i\'m reading up on creating reasonable, default configs for chrome and firefox on linux to do basic things like preventing (set default browser, import settings, etc.) dialog windows from appearing on a first run
2015-11-04T16:30:15 <avtar> i think i have a fairly good idea of how to achieve this for chrome and about to look into possible approaches for firefox
2015-11-04T16:30:30 <avtar> any idea if this has already been done for gpii projects?
2015-11-04T16:30:44 <Bosmon> avtar - never heard of such a thing :)
2015-11-04T16:30:56 <avtar> ok
2015-11-04T16:31:05 <avtar> onwards and upwards then
2015-11-04T16:31:21 <gtirloni> anastasiac: i\'m in favor of hosting docs at our own servers. we can host the code on github, have jenkins automatically build and deploy it (not any different from gh-pages with more flexibility for different branches, additional verification steps, etc)
