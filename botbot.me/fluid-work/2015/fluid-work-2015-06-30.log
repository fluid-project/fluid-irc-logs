2015-06-30T14:43:24 <simonjb> Bosmon, Bosmon7: have you ever seen a failure like this? jq: FAIL: Module "flowManager.save tests" Test name "PreferencesDataSource promise rejection" - Message: Assertion failure (see console.log for expanded message): Error - this thread is already marked to a different request. Make sure to invoke this request asynchronously.
2015-06-30T14:43:43 <Bosmon7> simonjb - I\'ve never seen one, no
2015-06-30T14:43:50 <simonjb> :(
2015-06-30T14:44:01 <Bosmon7> Well, clearly I\'ve seen one EVER
2015-06-30T14:44:05 <Bosmon7> But not from that test
2015-06-30T14:44:37 <simonjb> Bosmon7: I was running all-tests this morning and twice in a row got 479/484 and captured on the second run
2015-06-30T14:44:47 <simonjb> but now I\'m back to 479/479
2015-06-30T14:44:59 <simonjb> and can\'t reproduce
2015-06-30T14:46:44 <Bosmon7> simonjb - my feeling is the same for this as for last night\'s problem
2015-06-30T14:47:01 <Bosmon7> We don\'t actually have any tests whatsoever for concurrent use of the servers
2015-06-30T14:47:09 <Bosmon7> And so we almost certainly have bugs in this area
2015-06-30T14:48:11 <Bosmon7> What I imagine is that we have a race condition that causes one test fixture\'s requests to be able to hit another fixture\'s server
