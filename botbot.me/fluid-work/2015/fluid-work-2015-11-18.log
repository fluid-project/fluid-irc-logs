2015-11-18T17:03:03 <clown> colinclark, Bosmon:  is there an arch meeting today (now)?  Or, is everyone too busy with presentations?
2015-11-18T17:03:17 <colinclark> clown: We\'re deep in thick of our meetings at IBM
2015-11-18T17:03:26 <colinclark> You\'re welcome to listen in on Go To Meeting
2015-11-18T17:03:32 <colinclark> or to do something more fun and productive ;)
2015-11-18T17:03:57 <clown> colinclark:  that\'s what I thought.  Say hi to Rich.  And Kapser (if he\'s there).
2015-11-18T17:04:24 <clown> "something more fun and productive"  I\'ll grab lunch.  Then maybe I\'ll lurk.

2015-11-18T17:05:06 <clown> colinclark:  room Id?  The normal one for arch meetings is "waiting for organizer".

2015-11-18T19:27:38 <alanharnum> this article talks about a number of the themes we talk about in terms of FLOE and other OER work: http://er.educause.edu/articles/2015/11/pedagogy-technology-and-the-example-of-open-educational-resources
2015-11-18T19:28:04 <alanharnum> "OER makes possible the shift from a primarily student-content interaction to an arrangement where the content is integral to the student-student and student-instructor interactions as well. What we once thought of as pedagogical accompaniments to content (class discussion, students assignments, etc.) are now inextricable from the content itself, which has been set in motion as a process by the community that interacts with it. Moreo
2015-11-18T19:28:04 <alanharnum> ver, students asked to interact with OER become part of a wider public of developers, much like an open-source community."
