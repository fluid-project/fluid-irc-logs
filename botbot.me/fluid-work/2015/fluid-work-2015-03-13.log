2015-03-13T15:57:27 <anastasiac> jhung, any chance you could have a look at the Handbook pull request before you head off on vacation? It\xe2\x80\x99s very small\xe2\x80\xa6 https://github.com/fluid-project/handbook.floeproject.org/pull/21
2015-03-13T15:57:40 <jhung> sure anastasiac

2015-03-13T18:15:04 <Bosmon> simonjb - pang
2015-03-13T18:16:16 <Bosmon> oops sorry, need to dash out - back in about 20 mins
2015-03-13T18:26:40 <jhung1> anastasiac: I looked over the pull req. It looks good. I did not check content, just checked links and verified the table of contents.
2015-03-13T18:29:50 * Sepideh joined the channel
2015-03-13T18:30:13 <anastasiac> thanks, jhung1
2015-03-13T18:31:01 <simonjb> Bosmon: np, ping me when you\'re back -- I\'d like to chat about SelectionTree if you have a little time
2015-03-13T18:38:40 <Bosmon> Hey sure
2015-03-13T18:38:42 <Bosmon> I\'m back now, simonjb
2015-03-13T18:38:55 <simonjb> awesome
2015-03-13T18:40:59 <simonjb> Bosmon: I have modified the SelectionTree to use "children" containers and I\'ve done some reworking of the code (I\'ve not started on the binary state model addition yet)
2015-03-13T18:41:16 <Bosmon> simonjb - awesome
2015-03-13T18:41:44 <simonjb> Bosmon: I wanted to get your opinion on some code -- I have a function which walks the model structure, finding a node in the tree
2015-03-13T18:42:21 <Bosmon> simonjb - sure
2015-03-13T18:42:52 <simonjb> I have 2 versions: 1 which is shorter and re-uses fluid.get() but generates garbage, and one which is more complex but doesn\'t generate garbage
2015-03-13T18:42:55 <simonjb> Bosmon: https://gist.github.com/simonbates/1dedb8dfef6802dd21fa
2015-03-13T18:43:25 <simonjb> or, if you have a 3rd, better way, that would be great also
2015-03-13T18:43:54 <Bosmon> simonjb - I think the fluid.get version will be finer
2015-03-13T18:44:10 <simonjb> Bosmon: cool
2015-03-13T18:44:12 <Bosmon> For UI components like the selectionTree I think we would always choose readability over a bit of garbage
2015-03-13T18:45:02 <simonjb> thanks Bosmon, I was thinking that was probably where we leaned, but wanted to get your input
2015-03-13T18:45:50 <simonjb> I\'ll go ahead and commit what I have if you want to take a look and then continue on the binary state model addition
2015-03-13T18:46:16 <Bosmon> simonjb - sure - I\'m going out to dinner shortly but I\'ll be back in a couple of hours
2015-03-13T18:46:24 <Bosmon> Should be able to give it a look before EOD EST
2015-03-13T18:46:43 <simonjb> Bosmon: np, next week is good also, thanks!
2015-03-13T18:47:11 <Bosmon> next week is also a bit bad - I expect to be away for essentially all of it!
2015-03-13T18:47:15 <Bosmon> But I\'ll make sure I get to this before I go
2015-03-13T18:48:13 <Bosmon> It\'s a shame we don\'t have any funky functional utility to intersperse elements within arrays
2015-03-13T18:48:26 <Bosmon> I\'m sure that in Haskell or ML this function looks *MEGGER-CCOOL* (TM) : P
2015-03-13T18:48:54 <simonjb> Bosmon: yeah, I was wondering if we might have but didn\'t see anything in fluid
2015-03-13T18:49:19 * kasparnet joined the channel
2015-03-13T18:50:05 <Bosmon> fluid.generate is probably the closest, but it can\'t cope with this use case in its current form
2015-03-13T18:52:52 <Bosmon> In general array flattening in JavaScript is a bit clunky
2015-03-13T18:53:01 <Bosmon> I\'ve been toying with the idea of adding "mapcat" to our utilities
2015-03-13T18:54:03 <Bosmon> I came up with a use case for it recently, and so did kasparnet with the tests he wrote for his universal branch
2015-03-13T18:54:31 * kasparnet has quit
2015-03-13T18:56:49 <Bosmon> I don\'t feel that this function implemented with fluid.generate and a fluid.mapcat would be any more readable than your first version though
2015-03-13T18:56:54 <Bosmon> And it would generate even more garbage....
2015-03-13T19:09:46 <simonjb> Bosmon: https://github.com/simonbates/universal/commit/55468ea7f2c772d3f7dadfaa98fda39d3b91f315
2015-03-13T19:10:50 <simonjb> Bosmon: the diff is hard to read as I refactored, renamed, and moved stuff around
2015-03-13T19:12:33 <simonjb> Bosmon: the gpii.oauth2.selectionTree.toModel structure I left largely as was just with some new names and some comments -- we may want to rework this function at some point but might be okay for now
2015-03-13T19:14:40 <jhung1> anastasiac: I don\'t recall what happens now with updating the actual ILDH Mediawiki.
2015-03-13T19:14:45 * jhung1 is now known as jhung
2015-03-13T19:15:49 <anastasiac> jhung, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure either. It obviously doesn\xe2\x80\x99t update on any push to master. I was planning to wait to see if it happens overnight, and if not, contact the sysadmin team
2015-03-13T19:16:11 * michelled joined the channel
2015-03-13T19:18:42 <jhung> anastasiac: i\'m starting to feel that we should have a master list of how to deploy to the various sites.
2015-03-13T19:19:00 <anastasiac> jhung, I know they\xe2\x80\x99re working on it
2015-03-13T19:19:12 <jhung> ah, excellent
2015-03-13T19:19:15 <anastasiac> we will just make sure that the handbook is included in their plans
2015-03-13T19:19:25 <jhung> yeah
2015-03-13T19:19:38 <anastasiac> in fact, jhung, just yesterday the build site was set up to deploy automatically on any commit, using jenkins
2015-03-13T19:19:55 <jhung> Fantastic!
