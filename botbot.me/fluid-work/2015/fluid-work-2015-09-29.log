b"2015-09-29T19:17:53 <jhung> anastasiac: sure. What's the issue?
2015-09-29T19:18:37 <anastasiac> jhung: if you turn on the ToC (using UIO) and then reload the page, the ToC seems to try to render before the placeholder element is available, and so you get an error, and UIO won\xe2\x80\x99t work
2015-09-29T19:18:59 <anastasiac> jhung: error is in the console
2015-09-29T19:19:11 <anastasiac> nothing visible on screen, just UIO not opening up
2015-09-29T19:19:54 <jhung> Seems okay anastasiac. Want to confirm? https://jhung.github.io/docs-inclusive-learning/
2015-09-29T19:20:35 <anastasiac> oh, good, jhung, it seems fine there :-)
2015-09-29T19:20:50 <jhung> Excellent anastasiac.
2015-09-29T19:20:51 <anastasiac> since we\xe2\x80\x99ll be moving the infusion docs to the new system, we probably don\xe2\x80\x99t need to fix it in the current system
2015-09-29T19:21:08 <anastasiac> I\xe2\x80\x99ll file it nonetheless, for the record, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll make a note about the fact that it works in the new system
2015-09-29T19:21:17 <anastasiac> thanks for checking, jhung
2015-09-29T19:21:24 <jhung> ok. np anastasiac

2015-09-29T13:16:24 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: I want to write a unit test for my POST request to my gpis-express server
2015-09-29T13:16:46 <cindyli> thanks, Justin_o
2015-09-29T13:16:58 <Justin_o> I noticed that you were using kettle for this. What was the reason for that? Are there no other options?
2015-09-29T13:17:26 * alanharnum joined the channel
2015-09-29T13:18:51 <the-t-in-rtf> @Justin_o, I have many many examples of using gpii-express with the kettle test utilities.
2015-09-29T13:19:31 <the-t-in-rtf> gpii-express includes a caseholder that will take care of the wiring for you.
2015-09-29T13:19:59 <the-t-in-rtf> since (like Kettle) you have to start up gpii-express a few milliseconds after QUnit starts.
2015-09-29T13:20:15 <the-t-in-rtf> Let me see if that work has been merged.
2015-09-29T13:21:15 <the-t-in-rtf> This is the helper that provides the case holder: https://github.com/GPII/gpii-express/blob/master/tests/js/lib/test-helpers.js
2015-09-29T13:21:34 <the-t-in-rtf> The syntax is the same as a normal caseHolder, but you have to store the cases in rawOptions and let the harness evolve them.
2015-09-29T13:22:08 <the-t-in-rtf> Any of the tests in gpii-express use that caseholder, for example: https://github.com/GPII/gpii-express/blob/master/tests/js/router/router-caseholder.js
2015-09-29T13:22:10 <Justin_o> aw okay.. i was looking over those and was wondering about that
2015-09-29T13:22:45 <the-t-in-rtf> I had about 20 copies of that in various projects, Antranig shamed me into moving it into gpii-express.
2015-09-29T13:22:46 <the-t-in-rtf> :P
2015-09-29T13:22:55 <Justin_o> :)
2015-09-29T13:28:53 <cindyli> Justin_o: the pull request for FLOE-422 is ready for another look. thanks
2015-09-29T13:29:39 * jhernandez has quit
2015-09-29T13:32:21 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: do you have an example of a project using gpii-express that has tests.
2015-09-29T13:32:39 <the-t-in-rtf> gpii-express itself of course has tests, but yes, just a second.
2015-09-29T13:33:05 <Justin_o> I think I have something setup wrong as it is complaining that it cannot find the gpii.express.tests.caseHolder grade
2015-09-29T13:33:14 <Justin_o> so i just want something to compare my setup against
2015-09-29T13:33:26 <the-t-in-rtf> You can\'t just required gpii-express
2015-09-29T13:33:36 <the-t-in-rtf> the test case holder grade has to be pulled in explicitly
2015-09-29T13:33:55 <the-t-in-rtf> as in require("../../node_modules/gpii-express/tests/js/lib/xxx.js")
2015-09-29T13:34:02 <Justin_o> i did that too
2015-09-29T13:34:06 <Justin_o> maybe something\'s wrong with the path i used
2015-09-29T13:35:32 <Justin_o> the path seems to be correct.
2015-09-29T13:36:47 <the-t-in-rtf> Here\'s one from another package that brings it in from gpii-express:  https://github.com/the-t-in-rtf/gpii-pouchdb-lucene/blob/GPII-1241/tests/js/lucene-tests.js
2015-09-29T13:37:36 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, if you can check it in somewhere, happy to look at it.

2015-09-29T14:11:28 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: sorry i got a bit distracted by other things here. I\'ve checked in my code though so you can take a look before you go offline. https://github.com/jobara/first-discovery-server/tree/FLOE-423
2015-09-29T14:11:41 <Justin_o> i\'ll keep plugging away in the meantime
2015-09-29T14:11:51 <the-t-in-rtf> What\'s the test to run?
2015-09-29T14:14:20 <the-t-in-rtf> NM, there\'s only one\xe2\x80\xa6 :P
2015-09-29T14:24:09 <the-t-in-rtf> @Justin_o, it was complaining about the convenience grade I had in my tests to wrap kettle.request
2015-09-29T14:24:13 <the-t-in-rtf> which wasn\'t included.
2015-09-29T14:24:27 <the-t-in-rtf> you should probably replace that with kettle.request or your own wrapper.
2015-09-29T14:24:58 <the-t-in-rtf> Once I fixed that it complains about connection refused, which suggests something with either the service being tested or the request options.
2015-09-29T14:25:31 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: okay, that\'s further than i got
2015-09-29T14:30:16 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: thanks for the help.. it was a silly mistake.. i\'ll drill down into why my tests are failing now.
2015-09-29T14:30:41 <the-t-in-rtf> No problem.  I am submitting a pull request to add the standard postinstall hook to remove extra infusion instances
2015-09-29T14:30:45 <the-t-in-rtf> it\'s very convenient.
2015-09-29T14:30:57 <the-t-in-rtf> it does require moving your grunt deps in to the production block, which is why you\'ll see that.
2015-09-29T14:31:55 <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/jobara/first-discovery-server/pull/2
2015-09-29T14:32:09 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: cool thanks for that
2015-09-29T14:32:43 <the-t-in-rtf> Don\'t worry about silly mistakes, I have so much karma to pay forward there.  I only see the really stupid stuff the minute I show it to Antranig.
2015-09-29T14:32:55 <the-t-in-rtf> This one was pretty easy to miss.
2015-09-29T14:35:46 <Justin_o> i think half of Antranig\'s code review comments for me are about my typos :(
2015-09-29T14:38:30 <cindyli> alanharnum: do you have a few minutes to chat about your pull request for FLOE-412?

2015-09-29T16:37:18 <Justin_o> have you encountered that before?
2015-09-29T16:37:26 <the-t-in-rtf> I think you may need to update your grunt deps.
2015-09-29T16:37:38 <the-t-in-rtf> Let me paste a link to one that has everything.
2015-09-29T16:38:08 <the-t-in-rtf> Take a look at the Gruntfile.js and package.json in this one:  https://github.com/the-t-in-rtf/gpii-handlebars/
