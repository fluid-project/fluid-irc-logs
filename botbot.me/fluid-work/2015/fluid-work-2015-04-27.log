2015-04-27T18:05:18 <simonjb> hi danaayotte, I\'m implementing the "Select to begin typing" tooltip for the First Discovery keyboard panel https://www.dropbox.com/s/4nxvybp4d6rcb03/FD%20tool%20for%20May%202015%20workshop.pdf?dl=0
2015-04-27T18:06:35 <danaayotte> great simonjb
2015-04-27T18:06:38 <simonjb> danaayotte: and I had a question about the tooltip -- when I spoke to Justin last week he said that we might want to close/hide the tooltip when use user starts typing and I wanted to check with you if that was the case
2015-04-27T18:08:22 <danaayotte> yes simonjb, I agree - can we do that? so in that case, it would disappear when they start typing, and would reappear only if the mouse were moved again?
2015-04-27T18:09:45 <simonjb> danaayotte: I think it\'s possible yes and I\'ll need to check with Cindy to see what our options are in terms of showing it again once it\'s hidden
2015-04-27T18:09:56 <danaayotte> ok, thanks simonjb
2015-04-27T18:10:31 <simonjb> I\'ll let you know once I talk with her
2015-04-27T18:10:44 <danaayotte> ok. and in the case of keyboard focus - I guess it would appear again only if focus moved away and then back to the text field simonjb?
2015-04-27T18:11:14 <simonjb> danaayotte: yes, I believe so
2015-04-27T18:12:42 <simonjb> actually danaayotte, would you have a little time when Cindy is available to chat the 3 of us about the hiding and what our options/preferences are?
2015-04-27T18:13:27 <danaayotte> sure simonjb

2015-04-27T20:19:06 <cindyli> Bosmon: ur comments for my pull on FLUID-5657 are addressed and ready again
2015-04-27T20:23:25 <Bosmon> Cheers cindyli - now merged in :)
2015-04-27T20:23:33 <Bosmon> Thanks for implementing this incredibly strategic transform
2015-04-27T20:23:59 <cindyli> yay!! thanks, Bosmon
2015-04-27T20:24:14 <colinclark> It looks like an awesome transform, cindyli
2015-04-27T20:24:34 <cindyli> thanks, colinclark :)
2015-04-27T20:24:38 <colinclark> So Bosmon, is your 12,000-line pull request stable enough now that I should start reviewing it this week?
2015-04-27T20:24:52 <Bosmon> colinclark - it is done, yes
2015-04-27T20:24:55 <colinclark> Lucky me
2015-04-27T20:25:02 <colinclark> thankfully it is filled with awesome new features
2015-04-27T20:25:06 <anastasiac> cindyli, Bosmon, are the transforms documented anywhere?
2015-04-27T20:25:06 <colinclark> and the removal of lots of old ones
2015-04-27T20:25:08 <Bosmon> michelled says she\'s thinking of taking on the VP
2015-04-27T20:25:25 <Bosmon> For which the transform which cindyli just committed will be crucial :)
2015-04-27T20:25:26 <colinclark> With that branch, I assume, michelled and Bosmon>
2015-04-27T20:25:36 <Bosmon> anastasiac - transforms docs are lagging hugely unfortunately
2015-04-27T20:25:48 <Bosmon> We only have KASPARNET\'s guide in the GPII wiki
2015-04-27T20:25:54 <Bosmon> perhaps it\'s time to start recovering that
2015-04-27T20:25:55 * anvk has quit
2015-04-27T20:26:06 <anastasiac> ok, I\xe2\x80\x99ll add it to the docs to-do list to get that information into our lovely new Infusion documentation
2015-04-27T20:26:08 <colinclark> I found that worrisome when I started using model relay in my "spare" time, anastasiac
2015-04-27T20:26:09 <michelled> into the Infusion docs you mean?
2015-04-27T20:26:12 <colinclark> Relay is so cool
2015-04-27T20:26:18 <colinclark> but so fiercely undocumented
2015-04-27T20:26:36 <colinclark> It would be great to make a nice tutorial even just out of the currency converter example
