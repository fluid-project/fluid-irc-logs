b"2015-02-18T21:50:21 <simonjb> Justin_o: no probs, thanks very much for getting done what you were able to
2015-02-18T21:50:59 <Justin_o> :) you're welcome. let me know if you have questions about any of the code.

2015-02-18T21:52:22 <simonjb> Justin_o: I think I've figured out what the issue is with the clearing out of the preferences when running the gpii-oauth2-single-process-auth-server
2015-02-18T21:53:23 <simonjb> I'm still verifying, but I *think* it's because it is missing a JSON parser in the Express config (which the integrated CBFM has)
2015-02-18T21:53:54 <simonjb> the selected preferences get sent to the server but don't get parsed from the request
2015-02-18T21:54:23 <simonjb> since we got the integration working, we didn't spend a lot of time on the gpii-oauth2-single-process-auth-server
2015-02-18T21:54:51 <simonjb> it might still be worthwhile to keep it around, as an example, if I can get working quickly
2015-02-18T21:55:02 <simonjb> otherwise, it can just be removed

2015-02-18T22:06:38 <Justin_o> simonjb: ah that would make sense. But I wonder why it worked from the authorization page.
2015-02-18T22:07:14 <simonjb> Justin_o: because it is a form submission -- not an ajax request with json
2015-02-18T22:09:08 <simonjb> for authorization page posts a form body whereas the privacy page sends a json body -- the Express config is missing a json parser for the request body

2015-02-18T15:00:48 <Justin_o> michelled, cindyli, anastasiac: did you have a FLOE meeting yesterday?

2015-02-18T15:01:11 <anastasiac> Justin_o, no, we didn\xe2\x80\x99t, we\xe2\x80\x99re hoping to have one today

2015-02-18T15:02:23 <michelled> Justin_o: we were thinking of 1:00 since there is no soccer
2015-02-18T15:03:10 <michelled> danaayotte: are you available at 1:00 to talk about first discovery next steps?

2015-02-18T15:15:27 <anastasiac> sure
2015-02-18T15:15:38 <jhung> michelled: sure

2015-02-18T15:57:27 <jhung> anastasiac: I see that the a11y sprint website is using FSS layout, reset, and text. Do we still need this?
2015-02-18T15:57:45 <jhung> fwiw, I\'m using Foundation with normalize.
2015-02-18T15:58:23 <anastasiac> jhung, the a11y sprint website is a subpage of the floe website, so I just used what\xe2\x80\x99s there
2015-02-18T16:01:25 <jhung> anastasiac: okay. Thanks.
2015-02-18T16:02:32 <Bosmon> simonjb, Justin_o, michelled - I\'ve finished a round of review for GPII-17 pull request
2015-02-18T16:02:40 <Bosmon> The vast majority of the requests are for Justin_o \'s part of the work
2015-02-18T16:03:08 <michelled> cool - Justin_o will it be a lot of work to fix?
2015-02-18T16:03:26 <Justin_o> Bosmon: I didn\'t get an e-mail about that.. is it on github?
2015-02-18T16:03:44 <Bosmon> I\'ve tried to hold off from any major restructuring but I did think we should make at least a basic attempt to factor the dialog code off into a component
2015-02-18T16:03:56 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes - I guess since it is simonjb\'s branch you didn\'t get any notifications
2015-02-18T16:04:06 <Bosmon> But I guess you will get subscribed as soon as you make a comment in the thread
2015-02-18T16:04:31 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay, i\'ll go take a look
2015-02-18T16:05:15 <Justin_o> wow a lot of commits on that one :)
2015-02-18T16:14:50 <Bosmon> Justin_o - it is truly a MEGGER branch :)
2015-02-18T16:14:59 <Bosmon> Perhaps one of you could also supply some review for my section of the branch
2015-02-18T16:15:17 <Justin_o> which part was that?
2015-02-18T16:15:49 <Bosmon> Well, most of them are fixes against the core GPII architecture - except for the part that contains some tests for simonjb\'s work
2015-02-18T16:16:00 <Bosmon> perhaps we should get KASPARDNITT to look at it rather
2015-02-18T16:16:05 <Bosmon> Since I guess it will be him who merges in the end
2015-02-18T16:21:42 <Justin_o> Bosmon: sure, that makes sense

2015-02-18T16:50:08 <Justin_o> do you have any other ideas and/or would you like to mentor/co-mentor anything
2015-02-18T16:51:19 <Justin_o> jhung, anastasiac, lliskovoi: out of curiosity is the sprint site a docpad generated site?
2015-02-18T16:57:18 <Justin_o> simonjb: when would you like to talk about GPII-17? I\'ve finished reading through Bosmon\'s comments
2015-02-18T17:00:38 <anastasiac> Justin_o, the sprint site is a sub-page of the floeproject.org site.
2015-02-18T17:00:56 <anastasiac> so it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t use docpad
2015-02-18T17:01:14 <Justin_o> anastasiac: okay, thanks...
2015-02-18T17:03:18 <clown> simonjb, Bosmon: is there an arch meeting today?

2015-02-18T20:31:25 <colinclark> hey michelled and Justin_o
2015-02-18T20:31:40 <colinclark> Next week at the OER sprint, the PhET team is looking pretty enthusiastic
2015-02-18T20:32:00 <colinclark> Sam Reid, who you both know, has a big list of accessibility-related questions to work through
2015-02-18T20:32:09 <colinclark> and I think he\'s hoping to do some actual hacking, which is great
2015-02-18T20:32:18 <colinclark> to make the Forces and Motion sim work nicely with AT
2015-02-18T20:32:28 <Justin_o> cool
2015-02-18T20:32:44 <colinclark> Justin_o: I\'m hoping you can take a half day or a day and refresh your knowledge of Canvas accessibility
2015-02-18T20:32:51 <colinclark> it looks like it\'s slowly evolving
2015-02-18T20:33:05 <colinclark> with support for hit regions and focus highlighting in Firefox
2015-02-18T20:33:20 <Justin_o> colinclark: sounds like a good idea
2015-02-18T20:33:36 <colinclark> Can you do a bit of research just so you\'re familiar with the latest practices before Sam unleashes his questions on you, Justin_o? :)
2015-02-18T20:33:46 <Justin_o> colinclark: sure
2015-02-18T20:33:56 <colinclark> I found these slides useful: http://www.w3.org/Talks/2014/0510-canvas-a11y
2015-02-18T20:34:04 <Justin_o> colinclark: when will he be here? Wednesday?
2015-02-18T20:34:12 <colinclark> I think so, yes
2015-02-18T20:34:17 <colinclark> but hacking starts on thursday
2015-02-18T20:34:32 <Justin_o> colinclark: thanks
2015-02-18T20:34:56 <colinclark> I\'ll forward you his list, too
2015-02-18T20:35:35 <Justin_o> colinclark: yes, that would be helpful, thanks
