2015-08-07T19:31:01 <anastasiac> gtirloni: that FF 39 is likely me, but I\xe2\x80\x99m still on OS X 10.9, so 39 seems to be considered \xe2\x80\x9cup-to-date\xe2\x80\x9d
2015-08-07T19:31:43 <anastasiac> ah, actually, I\xe2\x80\x99m at 39.0.3, which is what they want you to upgrade to
2015-08-07T19:31:45 <anastasiac> so I\xe2\x80\x99m ok
2015-08-07T19:32:16 <anastasiac> Justin_o: are you testing the monster branch?
2015-08-07T19:33:03 <Justin_o> anastasiac: not yet, was waiting to see if the hosted version would be fixed, but i\'ll probably just pull it down soon
2015-08-07T19:33:08 <Justin_o> anastasiac: did you spot something?
2015-08-07T19:33:09 <anastasiac> ah, Justin_o, never mind. I was going to ask you to check something, but no need
2015-08-07T19:33:18 <anastasiac> it\xe2\x80\x99s in some code that\xe2\x80\x99s only on my machine :-)
2015-08-07T19:33:23 <Justin_o> ah okay
2015-08-07T19:34:00 <anastasiac> the monster branch is looking good now, Justin_o and Bosmon2
2015-08-07T19:34:05 <anastasiac> so far...

2015-08-07T20:23:37 <Justin_o> cindyli: yes.. that is not working in most of the demos.. but there should be a bug open for that
2015-08-07T20:23:50 <cindyli> ok, i will create a jira for it

2015-08-07T13:51:59 <alanharnum> A random plug for my previous employer: http://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/detail.jsp?Entt=RDMEDB0099&R=EDB0099
2015-08-07T13:52:15 <alanharnum> i have met a lot of tech people in Toronto who don\'t know this, but the library has an institutional subscription to Safari
2015-08-07T13:52:42 <alanharnum> so if you have a public library card you can get pretty much anything you want in browser-only ebook format via that, especially O\'Reilly stuff.

2015-08-07T14:24:04 <alanharnum> yeah it\'s saved me at least $1000 over the years, probably more

2015-08-07T14:49:07 <Justin_o> Bosmon: as i\'m writing transformations for FLOE-399, do they need to reversible?
2015-08-07T14:49:29 <Bosmon> Justin_o - only if they need to be :)
2015-08-07T14:49:50 <Justin_o> Bosmon: you mean only if i have a current use case for it?
2015-08-07T14:50:01 <Bosmon> Justin_o - sort of, yes : P
2015-08-07T14:50:39 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay.. thanks
2015-08-07T14:50:49 <Bosmon> Sorry not to be more clear :)
2015-08-07T14:51:00 <Bosmon> Many transforms are "by nature" irreversible, and some aren\'t
2015-08-07T14:51:27 <Justin_o> Bosmon: for example, the stringToNumber one that i am making for FLOE-399
2015-08-07T14:52:22 <Bosmon> It seems reasonable that that one might be reversible - in that there might be other sources of model update than the text field - but probably not in the initial implementation
2015-08-07T14:52:57 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay, thanks... i\'ll skip the reverse part for now

2015-08-07T15:29:32 <anastasiac> ok. I tried to get that working on Wed, but it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t set up right
2015-08-07T15:30:08 <alanharnum> it seems to be ok now, or at least i\'m seeing a view of the blackboard in the collab room from my desktop

2015-08-07T18:45:36 <gtirloni> yes
2015-08-07T18:45:57 <cindyli> cool. picking up some tasks
2015-08-07T18:46:01 <Justin_o> cindyli: thanks
2015-08-07T18:48:06 <anastasiac> Justin_o: did the \xe2\x80\x9cassorted content\xe2\x80\x9d manual prefs framework test work ok for you?
2015-08-07T18:48:58 <Justin_o> anastasiac: I haven\'t tried it after the update.. i\'ll check now
2015-08-07T18:49:14 <Justin_o> although i\'m having problems getting http://tor1-tst-app01.inclusivedesign.ca to load
2015-08-07T18:49:20 <Justin_o> gtirloni: that\'s the correct url ^
2015-08-07T18:49:24 <anastasiac> yeah, I am too, I\xe2\x80\x99m running locally
2015-08-07T18:49:31 <anastasiac> I assumed it was just because I was remote
2015-08-07T18:49:34 <anastasiac> but the, you are too
2015-08-07T18:49:59 <Justin_o> anastasiac: yah, could be related to that
2015-08-07T18:50:08 <Justin_o> cindyli: are you able to load the test instance?
2015-08-07T18:50:40 <gtirloni> that\'s the correct url, it loads fine here.. what error is it showing?
2015-08-07T18:50:48 <cindyli> Justin_o: i can load this - http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/tests/all-tests.html
2015-08-07T18:51:05 <gtirloni> cindyli, http://tor1-tst-app01.inclusivedesign.ca/tests/all-tests.html
2015-08-07T18:51:11 <anastasiac> it\xe2\x80\x99s just not loading for me, gtirloni, the browser just sits spinny-cursor-like
2015-08-07T18:51:22 <Justin_o> gtirloni: mines the same as anastasiac
2015-08-07T18:51:25 <cindyli> ah oh, thanks, gtirloni
2015-08-07T18:51:38 <anastasiac> cindyli: does it work for you?
2015-08-07T18:51:41 <gtirloni> anyone not at ocad also having this problem?
2015-08-07T18:51:54 <cindyli> http://tor1-tst-app01.inclusivedesign.ca/tests/all-tests.html works fine here
2015-08-07T18:52:10 <anastasiac> gtirloni: Justin_o and I are remote i.e. we\xe2\x80\x99re not onsite at OCADU
2015-08-07T18:52:12 <Justin_o> cindyli: when you test you need to use the above url
2015-08-07T18:52:17 <Justin_o> to test Bosmon2\'s branch
2015-08-07T18:52:33 <cindyli> Justin_o: above url you mean http://tor1-tst-app01.inclusivedesign.ca/
2015-08-07T18:52:38 <cindyli> yes, now using it
2015-08-07T18:52:39 <gtirloni> ok, let me check
2015-08-07T18:52:44 <Justin_o> cindyli: yep, thanks
2015-08-07T18:52:46 <anastasiac> cindyli: could you try manual-tests/framework/preferences/assortedContent/ and let me know if it works for you on the tor1-tst-app01 link?
2015-08-07T18:53:50 <cindyli> Justin_o: works fine - http://tor1-tst-app01.inclusivedesign.ca/tests/manual-tests/framework/preferences/assortedContent/
2015-08-07T18:54:05 <Justin_o> anastasiac: ^
2015-08-07T18:54:20 <anastasiac> cindyli: the UIO panel looks normal to you?
2015-08-07T18:54:25 <anastasiac> no errors loading css?
2015-08-07T18:55:07 <cindyli> anastasiac: looks normal and no css loading errors
2015-08-07T18:55:09 <gtirloni> it was a firewall rule. i guess all this time only people at ocad have been using that url... since nobody complained before :)
2015-08-07T18:55:17 <cindyli> your guys sounds desperated, haha
2015-08-07T18:55:55 <anastasiac> ok, cindyli thanks for checking. My problem might be due to a local instance. Justin_o, are you going to check out the branch and deploy locally to test?
2015-08-07T18:56:38 <anastasiac> ah, I have to run a build script, don\xe2\x80\x99t I?
2015-08-07T18:57:20 <anastasiac> that was it.
2015-08-07T18:57:25 <anastasiac> all good now :-)
