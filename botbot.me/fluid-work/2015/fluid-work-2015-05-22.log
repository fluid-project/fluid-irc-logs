2015-05-22T18:39:33 <Justin_o> cindyli, Bosmon: are there any plans to update infusion in the first discovery tool?
2015-05-22T18:40:20 <cindyli> i don't have this plan, Justin_o
2015-05-22T18:40:34 <Justin_o> cindyli: okay.. i might have to make a change in infusion for FLOE-318
2015-05-22T18:40:44 <Justin_o> but not sure if it is safe at this point to do that
2015-05-22T18:41:27 <cindyli> what's about? might be ok if it's not a big change
2015-05-22T18:42:35 <Justin_o> cindyli: the change isn't big, just to move the utteranceOptions from the options to the model
2015-05-22T18:42:48 <Justin_o> but i'm not sure what else has changed in infusion since the last time we updated
2015-05-22T18:42:56 <cindyli> ah ok
2015-05-22T18:43:04 <Justin_o> anyways, i'll look into it on monday
2015-05-22T18:43:07 <Justin_o> have a good weekend
2015-05-22T18:45:05 <cindyli> same to you
2015-05-22T18:48:29 <Bosmon> Hi cindyli, michelled - I have an initial review version of my pageable navIcons ready: https://github.com/fluid-project/first-discovery/pull/57

2015-05-22T20:45:16 <simonjb> cindyli: awesome, I'd like to book a little of your time to discuss next steps with the language panel -- anastasiac (thanks!) and I got the styling working this afternoon
2015-05-22T20:46:24 <cindyli> good progress, simonjb. ya, ping me when you are ready on monday morning

2015-05-22T14:50:47 <cindyli> sure, simonjb
2015-05-22T14:51:02 <simonjb> cindyli: can we do vidyo?
2015-05-22T14:51:07 <cindyli> certainly
2015-05-22T14:51:14 <cindyli> my room?
2015-05-22T14:51:15 <simonjb> call me when it\'s good
2015-05-22T14:51:18 <cindyli> ok
2015-05-22T15:20:03 <anastasiac> cindyli, Justin_o, simonjb: the work to add \xe2\x80\x9cshow sounds\xe2\x80\x9d (a yes/no question) to the FD tool involves refactoring the existing yes/no screen into a re-usable form. Other yes/no screens are dependent on this work. Has anyone taken on this work yet?
2015-05-22T15:20:25 <cindyli> anastasiac: i\'m on it
2015-05-22T15:20:49 <anastasiac> cindyli, excellent! shall I mark it \xe2\x80\x9cin progress\xe2\x80\x9d on the iteration page?
2015-05-22T15:21:42 <anastasiac> cindyli, nevermind - I see that the refacrtoring is part of 345, not 319
2015-05-22T15:21:42 <cindyli> anastasiac: this work is part of FLOE-345, i\'ve marked that "in progress". do we have another jira for it?
2015-05-22T15:21:49 <cindyli> ah ok
2015-05-22T15:21:58 * anastasiac is still working on her coffee

2015-05-22T16:07:09 <Justin_o> Bosmon: is there a way to pass in values into the name of a module and/or test using the IoC testing framework. It doesn\'t seem to support IoC expressions

2015-05-22T16:25:08 <Bosmon7> Hi there cindyli - I\'m just looking at this transduction code here: https://github.com/fluid-project/first-discovery/blob/master/src/js/navIcons.js#L94
2015-05-22T16:25:16 <Bosmon7> And it seems to me to be a bit overcomplicated
2015-05-22T16:25:40 <Bosmon7> Is there a reason it couldn\'t just read "position < currentPanelNum" ?
2015-05-22T16:26:20 <Bosmon7> The reliance on "prevPanelNum" seems like a bit of a smell
2015-05-22T16:27:19 <cindyli> thinking..
2015-05-22T16:27:50 <Bosmon7> I believe the UI requirement is for "all positions to the left of the current one to be confirmed" - is that right, or is there an extra subtlety?
2015-05-22T16:28:19 <cindyli> Bosmon7: that\'s true
2015-05-22T16:28:50 <cindyli> yes, can be simplified
2015-05-22T16:29:05 <Bosmon7> Ok... I\'ll add the simplification to the pull request I\'m working on
2015-05-22T16:29:53 <cindyli> Bosmon7: one sec, one case is the user visited some panels by clicking next, then clicking back to be back to one of the visited panels
2015-05-22T16:30:17 <Bosmon7> cindyli - should the panel that they have moved back from continue to be "confirmed" then?
2015-05-22T16:30:21 <cindyli> then, some of the panels to the right should stay as confirmed
2015-05-22T16:30:27 <Bosmon7> Ah, I see
2015-05-22T16:30:56 <Bosmon7> ok
2015-05-22T16:31:04 <Bosmon7> I\'ll add this requirement as an explanatory comment then
2015-05-22T16:31:10 <cindyli> thanks, Bosmon7

2015-05-22T17:35:15 <Justin_o> Bosmon: i\'m having trouble with options merging for my tester grade
2015-05-22T17:35:22 <Justin_o> should it support all the typical options merging?
2015-05-22T17:35:39 <Bosmon> Justin_o - could you be a little more specific :)
2015-05-22T17:36:11 <Justin_o> Bosmon:  sure
2015-05-22T17:36:14 <Justin_o> so i have the following code
2015-05-22T17:36:23 <Justin_o> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/EC5IbLBd
2015-05-22T17:36:38 <Justin_o> the distributeOptions isn\'t doing anything
2015-05-22T17:37:17 <Justin_o> if i replace the distributeOptions call with the commented out configuration the result is that the expectedModels.increaseStep is undefined
2015-05-22T17:37:46 <Bosmon> Justin_o - it seems you have a typo
2015-05-22T17:37:55 <Justin_o> there is already an expectedModels object in the options structure of the base tester grade
2015-05-22T17:38:00 <Bosmon> Your source reads "expectedModel" rather than "expectedModels"
2015-05-22T17:38:28 <Justin_o> ah see, it, okay the distribute options works
2015-05-22T17:38:32 <Justin_o> any idea about the other case?
2015-05-22T17:40:01 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I\'m not sure what you mean by the other case
2015-05-22T17:40:32 <Justin_o> Bosmon: the case where instead of using distribute options i try to configure directly, which is the commented out configuration in the supplied code block
2015-05-22T17:40:56 <Justin_o> when i do that, the expectedModels.increaseStep is undefined
2015-05-22T17:41:14 <Bosmon> Justin_o - which one of expectedModels.increaseStep is undefined?
2015-05-22T17:41:15 <Justin_o> i suppose the entire expectedModels object may be undefined
2015-05-22T17:41:39 <Justin_o> Bosmon: line 11 in the code snippet
2015-05-22T17:41:45 <Justin_o> it\'s used by the test
2015-05-22T17:42:10 <Justin_o> Bosmon: here\'s the base of the tester
2015-05-22T17:42:16 <Justin_o> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/WryFzwHD
2015-05-22T17:42:28 <Bosmon> Justin_o - the entirety of expectedModels.increasedStep is undefined, or just expectedModels.increasedStep.value is undefined?
2015-05-22T17:42:56 <Justin_o> so the test on line 27 throws an error
2015-05-22T17:44:21 <Justin_o> the error reported is
2015-05-22T17:44:22 <Justin_o> http://localhost:7888/first-discovery/tests/lib/infusion/test-core/utils/js/IoCTestUtils.js:545:43: undefined is not an object (evaluating \'expectedModel.value\')
2015-05-22T17:45:16 <Justin_o> that would be from this function
2015-05-22T17:45:25 <Justin_o> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/s9KmKIIn
2015-05-22T17:45:51 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I notice you don\'t have any "type" definition on your "rangePanelTester" component
2015-05-22T17:45:58 <Bosmon> I assume it is defined in gpii.tests.rangePanel itself
2015-05-22T17:46:26 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes
2015-05-22T17:46:30 <Justin_o> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/eZ2SQW5z
2015-05-22T17:46:35 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I believe what you are running into is this bug: http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5614
2015-05-22T17:46:46 <Bosmon> I suggest that what you do is move the commented out definitions into a separate grade
2015-05-22T17:47:43 <Bosmon> And also make sure that your grade explicitly mentions gpii.tests.rangePanelTester as a supergrade
2015-05-22T17:47:56 <Justin_o> Bosmon: ah i see
2015-05-22T17:48:02 <Bosmon> But you say that the distrubuteOptions definition works fine?
2015-05-22T17:48:07 <Justin_o> Bosmon: it seems to work with the distribute options, should i just keep that instead?
2015-05-22T17:48:12 <Justin_o> Bosmon: yes
2015-05-22T17:48:13 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, that would be better
2015-05-22T17:48:21 <Justin_o> okay.. i\'ll do that
2015-05-22T17:48:22 <Justin_o> thanks
2015-05-22T17:48:24 <Bosmon> I\'ll add a note on this JIRA that the problem is even more basic than I thought
2015-05-22T17:48:34 <Justin_o> thanks
