2015-07-15T19:48:59 <alanharnum> cindyli / Justin_o / maohzilla: two D3-based charting libraries that have jumped out at me so far (there are loads of them): http://nvd3.org/ & http://c3js.org/
2015-07-15T19:49:18 <alanharnum> nvd3 is Apache license, c3js is MIT
2015-07-15T19:50:21 <alanharnum> i also like the rhetoric behind https://github.com/gionkunz/chartist-js (it\'s not D3-based), but am uncertain of maturity / stability / community
2015-07-15T19:50:47 <alanharnum> "It\'s important to understand that one of the main intentions of Chartist.js is to rely on standards rather than providing it\'s own solution to a problem which is already solved by those standards. We need to leverage the power of browsers today and say good bye to the idea of solving all problems ourselves."

2015-07-15T19:52:47 <cindyli> thanks for looking up, alanharnum. this is awesome
2015-07-15T19:53:39 <Justin_o> alanharnum: thanks
2015-07-15T19:53:47 <maozillah> :D
2015-07-15T19:53:51 <alanharnum> this is mostly based on hazy memories of my sprint research (meow meow meow)
2015-07-15T19:56:08 * anastasiac joined the channel
2015-07-15T19:56:36 * michelled joined the channel
2015-07-15T19:56:55 <alanharnum> but C3 and NVD3 seem to be the big "higher level, built on D3" libraries
2015-07-15T19:57:04 <alanharnum> This is also kinda helpful: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8232901
2015-07-15T19:57:12 <alanharnum> big discussion about charting libraries on hacker news from last year
2015-07-15T19:57:52 <maozillah> cindyli: https://css-tricks.com/fluid-width-equal-height-columns/
2015-07-15T19:58:51 <maozillah> if the table cell method really doesn\xe2\x80\x99tt work maybe try the nicholas gallagher method
2015-07-15T19:59:44 <alanharnum> another one, MIT-licensed, seems to be recommended by people as simpler for basic charts vs C3/NVD3: https://github.com/PMSI-AlignAlytics/dimple/
2015-07-15T19:59:55 <cindyli> thanks, maozillah, will have a look soon
2015-07-15T19:59:59 * michelled joined the channel
2015-07-15T20:00:23 <alanharnum> and another! https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js
2015-07-15T20:00:50 * michelled joined the channel
2015-07-15T20:00:52 <alanharnum> we definitely need a dashboard for the maturity of open source charting libraries
2015-07-15T20:01:04 <alanharnum> but which open source charting library will we use to build that dashboard?!!?
2015-07-15T20:01:40 <maozillah> cats
2015-07-15T20:01:49 <maozillah> just throw cats at it
2015-07-15T20:01:54 * alanharnum recurses infinitively until he overflows the stack.
2015-07-15T20:03:31 <alanharnum> also worth looking at - a lot of the D3-based libraries seem to conform to this standard: http://bost.ocks.org/mike/chart/
2015-07-15T20:04:13 * michelled joined the channel
2015-07-15T20:04:43 <alanharnum> so in theory we could choose one D3-based library and swap out another down the road if we don\'t like it, with some wrapper code ("in theory")

2015-07-15T20:22:15 <cindyli> jhung: i sent a pull request for stretching the side bar height for doc-base-start repo - https://github.com/jhung/doc-base-start/pull/1
2015-07-15T20:22:24 <cindyli> it uses css instead of javascript
2015-07-15T20:23:23 * michelled joined the channel
2015-07-15T20:23:29 <jhung> interesting cindyli. I\'ll check it out.
2015-07-15T20:23:35 <jhung> thanks!
2015-07-15T20:24:13 * michelled joined the channel
2015-07-15T20:24:18 <cindyli> jhung: it turns out with javascript, there will be performance issues with auto-detecting the change of the content height since there\'s no standard events for that change, we will need to add a timer to manually check the height at a interval, which doesn\'t seem right
2015-07-15T20:24:29 <cindyli> so, falling back to look for css solutions
2015-07-15T20:24:57 <cindyli> review it carefully, jhung, you know my css skills, even myself is not very confident ;)
2015-07-15T20:25:04 <jhung> :D
