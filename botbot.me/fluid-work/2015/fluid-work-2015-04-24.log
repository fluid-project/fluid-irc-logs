2015-04-24T13:47:54 <Bosmon7> Hi there cindyli, thanks
2015-04-24T13:48:17 <cindyli> thank you for reviewing it, Bosmon7 :)

2015-04-24T13:58:11 <Bosmon7> Thanks, cindyli - it\'s looking good
2015-04-24T13:58:20 <Bosmon7> I left some comments on simplifying and generifying the relay rules
2015-04-24T13:59:02 <cindyli> sure. thanks, Bosmon7, i haven\'t gone thru all those. regarding creating fluid.transforms.indexOf, should i fire a infusion jira for that?
2015-04-24T14:00:24 <cindyli> *file*
2015-04-24T14:02:23 * anastasiac joined the channel
2015-04-24T14:15:55 <simonjb> cindyli: do you have a little time to help me with gpii.firstDiscovery.attachTooltip?
2015-04-24T14:16:06 <cindyli> sure, simonjb
2015-04-24T14:16:13 <cindyli> vidyo?
2015-04-24T14:16:47 <simonjb> cindyli: yes, that would be great -- call me when you\'re available
2015-04-24T14:17:45 * sepideh joined the channel
2015-04-24T14:26:17 * kasparnet has quit
2015-04-24T14:41:32 <Bosmon7> cindyli - I think you can just make the implementation, it\'s not a very elaborate piece of functionality :)
2015-04-24T14:42:12 <cindyli> Bosmon or Bosmon7, yes, i\'ve created an infusion jira and working on it. http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5657
2015-04-24T14:42:23 <Bosmon7> cindyli - great, thanks!
2015-04-24T14:42:45 <Bosmon7> This is actually a crucial piece that will also be essential in repairing our video player - uioptions integration
2015-04-24T14:43:10 <Bosmon7> Since I remember that a lot of the complexity in our "manual relay system" that we used to have was dealing with the difference in language mapping state
2015-04-24T14:44:36 <cindyli> good to know it\'s so useful :)
2015-04-24T14:45:52 <cindyli> Bosmon7, in the pull request for the language panel, yesterday I added some improvement for attachTooltip component, can you take a look on that too - https://github.com/cindyli/first-discovery/blob/FLOE-281/src/js/tooltip.js
2015-04-24T14:46:11 <cindyli> maybe you already did
2015-04-24T14:46:26 <cindyli> and no comment. that would be great ;)
2015-04-24T14:59:08 <cindyli> simonjb: the attachTooltip component has been improved. The brach for it - https://github.com/cindyli/first-discovery/tree/FLOE-308
2015-04-24T14:59:16 <cindyli> let me know how it works
2015-04-24T14:59:35 <Bosmon7> cindyli - sorry, thanks for directing me to it, I added some comments now :)
2015-04-24T14:59:58 <cindyli> we can continue to improve and file a pull request when it\'s good enough for you
2015-04-24T15:00:07 <cindyli> thanks, Bosmon7, will take a look soon
2015-04-24T15:00:27 <simonjb> thanks cindyli, that was quick! I use the special name "CONTAINER"?
2015-04-24T15:00:43 <cindyli> yes, simonjb
2015-04-24T15:00:52 <Bosmon7> I think there\'s also a further instance of "applier.change" in that file that didn\'t appear in the pull, cindyli
2015-04-24T15:01:07 <Bosmon7> cindyli - what does the special name do?
2015-04-24T15:01:31 <cindyli> Bosmon7, it refers to the component container itself
2015-04-24T15:01:42 <Bosmon7> cindyli - in what context
2015-04-24T15:02:33 <cindyli> right now attachTooltip looks into "selectors" block to find dom elements to attach tooltips on. "CONTAINER" is say, the dom element is the component container itself, Bosmon7
2015-04-24T15:02:42 <cindyli> to say**
2015-04-24T15:03:11 <Bosmon7> ok, I see
2015-04-24T15:03:12 <cindyli> the jira for this change - http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLOE-308, Bosmon7
2015-04-24T15:03:51 <Bosmon7> If this is likely to happen, wouldn\'t it be simpler for the owner of "selectors" to add a selector whose value is "" ?
2015-04-24T15:04:02 <Bosmon7> Special-casing it in the tooltip attacher seems peculiar
2015-04-24T15:05:02 <cindyli> you mean to add a selector with value "" into the "selectors" block? Bosmon7
2015-04-24T15:05:23 <Bosmon7> cindyli - actually, this is already supported automatically by the DOM binder
2015-04-24T15:05:25 <cindyli> would that.locate("") returns the container?
2015-04-24T15:05:30 <Bosmon7> cindyli - it already does
2015-04-24T15:05:43 <cindyli> oh, that\'s cool. let me try it
2015-04-24T15:06:24 <Bosmon7> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/core/js/FluidView.js#L164
2015-04-24T15:07:09 <cindyli> yes, works perfectly!! thanks, Bosmon7
2015-04-24T15:07:40 <Bosmon7> cool
2015-04-24T15:07:52 <Bosmon7> Yes, we don\'t even need a selector whose value is "", since a selector whose name is "" already works fine
2015-04-24T15:08:44 <cindyli> yes, that\'s true, Bosmon7, we don\'t need to make any change into "selectors" block
2015-04-24T15:08:57 <simonjb> so cindyli, Bosmon7, if I am following the above discussion, it looks like we don\'t need FLOE-308? I can just use "" as the tooltipContentMap key?
2015-04-24T15:09:01 <cindyli> just use "" when defining the mapping
2015-04-24T15:09:13 <cindyli> exactly, simonjb
2015-04-24T15:09:39 <cindyli> i will add a comment into attachTooltip for that
2015-04-24T15:09:46 <simonjb> ok, great, thanks

2015-04-24T15:43:56 <anastasiac> jhung, I have a mind like a sieve today. You mentioned in stand-up that you issued a pull request for something \xe2\x80\x93 that was for code block styling, right?
2015-04-24T15:45:42 <jhung> yes anastasiac https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/pull/64
2015-04-24T15:46:02 <anastasiac> ok, thanks. I just wanted to make sure I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t missing something. I\xe2\x80\x99ll have a look at that today, jhung
2015-04-24T15:46:24 <jhung> thanks anastasiac.
2015-04-24T15:58:17 <anastasiac> cindyli, does the FD tool currently save the prefs in a cookie, and if so, what is the cookie name?
2015-04-24T16:00:34 <cindyli> anastasiac: the cookie name is "fluid-ui-settings"
2015-04-24T16:02:43 <anastasiac> thanks, cindyli
2015-04-24T16:03:18 <cindyli> np
2015-04-24T16:23:10 <cindyli> Bosmon or Bosmon7, i sent a pull request to add fluid.transforms.indexOf - https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/594. can you take a look? thanks
2015-04-24T16:35:13 <Bosmon7> Thanks, cindyli - I have reviewed it
2015-04-24T16:40:03 <cindyli> sorry, Bosmon7, so many obvious mistakes. :) all addressed and pushed
2015-04-24T16:46:41 <Bosmon7> Thanks cindyli - reviewed and pushed

2015-04-24T17:17:25 <cindyli> Bosmon7: is there a way to declaratively express {that}.options.controlValues.lang.length - 1
2015-04-24T17:17:54 <cindyli> checking the last array element needs to compare the index with length - 1
2015-04-24T17:23:15 <cindyli> trying with fluid.transforms.binaryOp
2015-04-24T17:26:32 <cindyli> fluid.transforms.binaryOp with operator "-" works
2015-04-24T17:29:10 * slim_jim joined the channel
2015-04-24T17:32:52 <Bosmon7> cindyli - it is not worth it
2015-04-24T17:32:58 <Bosmon7> My suggestion was that you moved to 1-based indexing
2015-04-24T17:33:16 <Bosmon7> We\'ll work on the "reduced expression parser" later in the year that will resolve such problems
2015-04-24T17:33:56 <cindyli> do you mean to have "fluid.transforms.indexOf" returns a +1 index, Bosmon7
2015-04-24T17:34:42 <Bosmon7> cindyli - ah, oops
2015-04-24T17:34:43 <Bosmon7> I see : P
2015-04-24T17:34:52 <Bosmon7> Ok
2015-04-24T17:35:02 <Bosmon7> Yes, you can add an "offset" to the indexOf transformer
2015-04-24T17:35:19 <cindyli> good idea. making the change
2015-04-24T17:35:23 <Bosmon7> Whilst you\'re at it you can add a dedicated "notFound" option as well
2015-04-24T17:35:36 <Bosmon7> So that the user has the chance to configure the "-1" value to another
2015-04-24T17:38:14 <Bosmon7> cindyli - as a final element, could you please add an inverse transform for it, called "fluid.transforms.dereference"
2015-04-24T17:38:24 <Bosmon7> So that it becomes a proper bidirectional lens :)
2015-04-24T17:39:16 * Bosmon8 joined the channel
2015-04-24T17:40:22 <cindyli> Bosmon7: what does "fluid.transforms.dereference" do? find the value based on the index, array and offset? what if the index is -1?
2015-04-24T17:40:43 <cindyli> i mean the value is not in the array?
2015-04-24T17:42:35 * Bosmon7 has quit
2015-04-24T17:42:36 <cindyli> now you have 3 ids in the channel, Bosmon, Bosmon7, Bosmon8. how many devices are you using simultaneously? :)
2015-04-24T17:45:27 <Bosmon8> cindyli - if the value is not in the array, by default it returns undefined
2015-04-24T17:45:35 <cindyli> ah ok
2015-04-24T17:45:37 <Bosmon8> Yes, it will find the value based on the index, array and offset
2015-04-24T17:45:49 <Bosmon8> But you can allow the user to configure the notFound value independently at that end too
2015-04-24T17:46:06 * slim_jim has quit
2015-04-24T17:47:15 <cindyli> that\'s true
2015-04-24T18:01:22 <jhung> anastasiac: I just realized that I did not add any contrast styling for the new code blocks which are links. I\'ll fix that and update my pull req.
2015-04-24T18:01:40 <anastasiac> jhung, do you mean for the high-contrast?
2015-04-24T18:02:06 <jhung> yes anastasiac.
2015-04-24T18:02:42 <anastasiac> ok, have a look, jhung, but I did try it, and it seems reasonable. The text looks ok, and it stands out/blends in about as much as in the default theme
2015-04-24T18:09:01 <jhung> anastasiac: if you switch to a contrast theme and mouse hover over the "modelComponent options" link (1bout 2/3rd way down). What do you think of that? The code block doesn\'t invert colour on hover.
2015-04-24T18:10:21 <anastasiac> ah, hover styling, right. Yeah, that looks weird, jhung, we should fix that
2015-04-24T18:10:41 <anastasiac> thanks for catching that
2015-04-24T18:11:03 <jhung> ok. I\'ll fix that and push it up once I wrap up the thing I\'m working on anastasiac.
2015-04-24T18:53:07 <anastasiac> jhung, I\xe2\x80\x99ve provided some feedback on the \xe2\x80\x98skip links\xe2\x80\x99 pull request
