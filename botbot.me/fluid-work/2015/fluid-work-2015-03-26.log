2015-03-26T17:27:32 <michelled> I see that you have started it, perhaps you can hand him anything you\'ve done and get started on some other PGA work
2015-03-26T17:28:12 <cindyli> michelled: that\'s great. i\'ve started thinking about it, no any code in yet
2015-03-26T17:29:24 <cindyli> Bosmon: thanks! i\'ve re-assigned the jira to you - http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5599?src=confmacro

2015-03-26T19:46:31 <simonjb> Bosmon: and in the end the gpii-oauth2-authz-server/public/tests/lib/infusion was actually unnecessary and I could just delete it
2015-03-26T19:47:02 <simonjb> everything we had there was in /node_modules/infusion
2015-03-26T19:49:57 <Bosmon> simonjb - that\'s brilliant
2015-03-26T19:50:52 <simonjb> thanks very much Bosmon for catching this -- I\'m really glad that we made this change
2015-03-26T19:51:05 <Bosmon> No worries, simonjb
2015-03-26T19:51:16 <Bosmon> It was hard to avoid catching it, since I found that I couldn\'t run any of the tests : P

2015-03-26T19:57:34 <Bosmon> We should be prepared to field some complaints from the MM teams that the payloads have changed, if they are trying to integrate something - but other than that things ought to be fine
2015-03-26T19:57:43 <Bosmon> Then we can try to merge up with your branch and resolve the conflicts
2015-03-26T19:58:31 <Bosmon> ugggh
2015-03-26T19:58:44 <Bosmon> It appears we already have some conflicts with master...

2015-03-26T14:36:10 <cindyli> Bosmon2: i was trying to create a unit test for the issue Justin_o had yesterday with default model value not being overridden by the relayed value. But seems a straight relay doesn\'t reproduce the problem. I think it\'s the context in the prefs framework or the first discovery tool that triggered the issue. I still can reproduce it with Justin_o\'s branch. I\'m going to put this on hold for now and come back to it when I have a clearer picture

2015-03-26T14:59:10 <Bosmon> Hi simonjb
2015-03-26T14:59:28 <simonjb> hey
2015-03-26T14:59:34 <Bosmon> I\'m looking over the branch and I\'m noticing something very odd about the test cases for the Oauth UI components
2015-03-26T14:59:36 <Bosmon> https://github.com/simonbates/universal/blob/GPII-17/gpii/node_modules/gpii-oauth2/gpii-oauth2-authz-server/public/tests/all-tests.html
2015-03-26T14:59:49 <Bosmon> Somehow it seems that all the includes in this test file are incorrect
2015-03-26T15:00:21 <Bosmon> They\'re expecting to find infusion at ../infusion, whereas it is checked in at ../lib/infusion
2015-03-26T15:00:35 <Bosmon> hmm
2015-03-26T15:00:38 <Bosmon> Well it\'s not even there
2015-03-26T15:00:41 <Bosmon> perhaps I have missed a build step?
2015-03-26T15:00:56 * colinclark joined the channel
2015-03-26T15:01:00 <simonjb> Bosmon: they are served up through the webserver
2015-03-26T15:01:12 <simonjb> through express
2015-03-26T15:01:29 <Bosmon> Through the webserver!
2015-03-26T15:01:49 <simonjb> :(
2015-03-26T15:02:17 <Bosmon> How do I run this webserver :)
2015-03-26T15:04:00 <simonjb> they are served up with the authorization server
2015-03-26T15:04:34 <simonjb> so you could run the examples/easit-oauth-integration/driver.js
2015-03-26T15:04:58 <simonjb> I
2015-03-26T15:05:04 <Bosmon> simonjb - do you mean that, then, every production instance of the architecture is exposing a page by which we run its test cases?
2015-03-26T15:05:25 <simonjb> yes :(
2015-03-26T15:05:31 <Bosmon> That seems a little funky : P
2015-03-26T15:05:37 <simonjb> agreed
2015-03-26T15:06:20 <Bosmon> As well as making it impossible to run our test cases from a single point
2015-03-26T15:06:36 <simonjb> it\'s been this way since the start and I\'m guessing this isn\'t a typical pattern?
2015-03-26T15:07:07 <Bosmon> simonjb - the intention is that all of the web-based tests for the architecture can be run from this file:
2015-03-26T15:07:08 <Bosmon> https://github.com/simonbates/universal/blob/GPII-17/tests/web/html/all-tests.html
2015-03-26T15:07:52 <simonjb> ok
2015-03-26T15:08:04 <simonjb> so, let\'s figure out what we need to do to fix this
2015-03-26T15:08:21 <Bosmon> In theory, this just looks like a matter of taking the first file I pasted, taking its contents and pasting them into the latter file, with the include paths adjusted
2015-03-26T15:08:33 <Bosmon> Do you think it\'s possible this might be the case? : P
2015-03-26T15:08:51 <simonjb> I am hoping so
2015-03-26T15:09:17 <simonjb> and the https://github.com/simonbates/universal/blob/GPII-17/tests/web/html/all-tests.html is run through a web server?
2015-03-26T15:09:38 <simonjb> or off the file system
2015-03-26T15:10:06 <Bosmon> simonjb - it is run off the file system
2015-03-26T15:11:06 <simonjb> let me pull in Justin_o to understand the web server requirement
2015-03-26T15:11:17 <simonjb> can we chat on skype, the 3 of us?
2015-03-26T15:11:24 <Bosmon> sure

2015-03-26T15:49:03 <anastasiac> danaayotte, there was an update recently, and michelled noticed problems during interactions between someone who had updated and someone who hadn\xe2\x80\x99t
2015-03-26T15:49:05 <avtar> i think simonjb had that issue at one point but we attributed that to a special feature of the windows client
2015-03-26T15:49:50 <danaayotte> hmm. I have the latest version
2015-03-26T15:51:24 <avtar> danaayotte: i just sent you a link to a google doc that jess shared
2015-03-26T15:52:00 <avtar> it\'s a list of issues that we edit whenever something like this occurs and then she requests feedback from et group/vidyo during her weekly calls

2015-03-26T16:38:31 <simonjb> Bosmon, I\'m making progress on restructuring the tests as we discussed, but I\'ve hit an issue where we are loading a template with ajax. I\'m getting "XMLHttpRequest cannot load file:/... Cross origin requests are only supported for protocol schemes: http, data, chrome, chrome-extension, https, chrome-extension-resource." I seem to remember this issue in the past?
2015-03-26T16:38:43 <Bosmon> simonjb - yes
2015-03-26T16:39:32 <Bosmon> We either run with the browser flags as described on this page: http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Browser+settings+to+support+local+Ajax+calls
