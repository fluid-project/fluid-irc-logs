2015-06-11T12:41:42 <anastasiac> cindyli, do you know where in the FD tool code the ui enhancer and settings store store are actually added to the FD tool? where is that done? who\xe2\x80\x99s responsible? where are the subcomponents declared?
2015-06-11T12:42:53 <cindyli> anastasiac: FD tool uses the schema version of the prefs framework that builder.js assembles UIE, UIO and store together
2015-06-11T12:43:30 <anastasiac> cindyli: does the schema actually provide instructions for that? or does the builder just do it automatically?
2015-06-11T12:43:48 <cindyli> anastasiac: the builder does it automatically - https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/preferences/js/Builder.js#L74-L95
2015-06-11T12:44:37 <anastasiac> cindyli: so there\xe2\x80\x99s no way to use a store other than the globalSettingsStore?
2015-06-11T12:45:24 <anastasiac> ah, I\xe2\x80\x99d need a demands block to override the cookie store, is that right cindyli?
2015-06-11T12:45:37 <cindyli> yes, exactly, anastasiac
2015-06-11T12:46:05 <anastasiac> ok, I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve got it. Thanks, cindyli. When you review the PGA architecture report for me, you can check if I\xe2\x80\x99ve got it right :-)
2015-06-11T12:46:16 <cindyli> sure
