2015-06-29T20:18:13 <alanharnum> glad to be here
2015-06-29T20:18:22 <colinclark> everyone\'s smileys have sunglasses on today
2015-06-29T20:18:34 <colinclark> what a cool irc channel
2015-06-29T20:18:42 <simonjb> Bosmon7: https://gist.github.com/simonbates/b745cfb7ecf9f35b1a2e
2015-06-29T20:19:05 <Bosmon7> Thanks simonjb
2015-06-29T20:19:11 <Bosmon7> They are running fine for me on Windows here
2015-06-29T20:19:26 <simonjb> Bosmon7: you are getting 145/145 ?
2015-06-29T20:19:47 <Bosmon7> simonjb - yes
2015-06-29T20:20:08 <simonjb> Bosmon7: ok, I will continue to debug, what version of node?
2015-06-29T20:20:09 <Bosmon7> Although I have seen these ECONNREFUSED errors occasionally in longer test runs
2015-06-29T20:20:14 <Bosmon7> Never on that particular fixture though
2015-06-29T20:20:48 <simonjb> I\'m running v0.10.38
2015-06-29T20:20:51 <Bosmon7> I have node version 0.10.34
2015-06-29T20:21:32 <Bosmon7> simonjb - your test failure seems more peculiar though since it seems as if the server really has been stopped
2015-06-29T20:21:33 <simonjb> do you think the version might be significant? I could try downgrading
2015-06-29T20:21:47 <Bosmon7> The variety of that failure I have got has always been immediately after the server was started
2015-06-29T20:21:50 <simonjb> I know
2015-06-29T20:22:10 <simonjb> if I comment out the last test, I seem to always get a pass
2015-06-29T20:22:17 <Bosmon7> simonjb - is the failure absolutely consistent?
2015-06-29T20:23:15 <simonjb> Bosmon7: well, it\'s interesting -- if I run node AcceptanceTests_chrome_oauth2.js in a terminal, I always get the failure 143/145
2015-06-29T20:23:27 <Bosmon7> urgh
2015-06-29T20:23:28 <Bosmon7> One of these
2015-06-29T20:23:33 <simonjb> however, before narrowing the issue to AcceptanceTests_chrome_oauth2.js
2015-06-29T20:23:37 <Bosmon7> I had assumed this kind of thing could only happen on Windows :)
2015-06-29T20:23:42 <simonjb> I was running all-tests.js
2015-06-29T20:24:30 <simonjb> and in terminal I got 479/481, but redirecting output to a file, I got 479/479
2015-06-29T20:25:18 <simonjb> so something fishy is going on
2015-06-29T20:25:19 * anvk has quit
2015-06-29T20:26:07 <Bosmon7> simonjb - in fact I get 143/143 on Windows
2015-06-29T20:26:14 <simonjb> ah
2015-06-29T20:26:25 <Bosmon7> The end sequence is identical, only the server closes AFTER the get requests and not before
2015-06-29T20:28:56 <Bosmon7> simonjb - the fact that there are two requests to /settings is very suspicious
2015-06-29T20:29:38 <Bosmon7> The request objects are actually one-shot only
2015-06-29T20:29:49 <simonjb> node AcceptanceTests_chrome_oauth2.js > oauth2.out 2>&1 -- still 143/145
2015-06-29T20:30:44 <simonjb> Bosmon7: maybe I\'ll try changing my node version and see if that makes a difference
2015-06-29T20:31:10 <Bosmon7> simonjb - I think it won\'t
2015-06-29T20:31:17 <Bosmon7> This looks like a real implementation fault
2015-06-29T20:31:42 <simonjb> is there anyone else there who could run the tests on MacOS or another Linux install?
2015-06-29T20:32:01 <Bosmon7> There is, but I think it will have to be tomorrow
2015-06-29T20:32:13 <simonjb> the fact that it\'s working on Windows is a little worrying
2015-06-29T20:32:28 <simonjb> ok
2015-06-29T20:32:30 * colinclark has quit
2015-06-29T20:32:56 <Bosmon7> simonjb - well, I think this might just be in the class of "implementation fault tickles undefined behaviour"
2015-06-29T20:33:14 <Bosmon7> The first thing we should try is to get the last test fixture to print out the sequence configuration before running it
2015-06-29T20:33:15 <simonjb> Bosmon7: that\'s plausible, yes
2015-06-29T20:33:40 <Bosmon7> It\'s possible that the "truncateAt" directive isn\'t correctly chopping off the final elements
2015-06-29T20:33:51 <simonjb> Bosmon7: ok, I
2015-06-29T20:33:57 <simonjb> will try that now
2015-06-29T20:34:02 <Bosmon7> simonjb - there\'s only one request object that can target /settings
2015-06-29T20:34:17 <Bosmon7> The "securedSettingsRequest"
2015-06-29T20:34:28 <Bosmon7> So we really shouldn\'t be seeing the request fired twice
2015-06-29T20:34:45 <Bosmon7> And those request objects are quite likely to become corrupted if reused

2015-06-29T21:24:20 * jhernandez joined the channel
2015-06-29T21:25:37 <simonjb> Bosmon7: because using truncateAt: 15 chops off the last entry in the sequence (it\'s 16 long) and then leaves sendSecuredSettingsRequest as the 15th, final entry
2015-06-29T21:26:14 <simonjb> we then insert our additional entries at 14, before this last sendSecuredSettingsRequest
2015-06-29T21:26:28 <simonjb> leaving the sendSecuredSettingsRequest as the last entry
2015-06-29T21:27:31 <simonjb> Bosmon7: if I change to truncateAt: 14 I get 143/143 and for all-tests 479/479
2015-06-29T21:27:36 <simonjb> all passing

2015-06-29T17:33:28 <gtirloni> i\'ve got a weird problem and i\'m not sure i\'m trying to use the prefs server in the right way
2015-06-29T17:33:29 * michelled joined the channel
2015-06-29T17:33:48 <gtirloni> a "GET /user/elaine" is returning 404.. but it doesn\'t even attempt to connect to the couchdb server
2015-06-29T17:34:11 <gtirloni> any ideas? i confirmed the configs/production.json has the right server address for couchdb
2015-06-29T17:46:55 * jhernandez joined the channel
2015-06-29T17:55:16 <colinclark> hey kasparnet ^
2015-06-29T17:56:04 <kasparnet> gtirloni: hmm... not sure -- I\'m not that well versed in the couchdb stuf.. Generally, when getting preferences, I do it via the prefs server
2015-06-29T17:56:13 <kasparnet> which would be "GET /preferences/elaine"
2015-06-29T17:56:26 <colinclark> that URL changed a while ago, didn\'t it kasparnet?
2015-06-29T17:56:29 <kasparnet> or "GET /rawPreferences/elaine" which is the more direct/unmodified route
2015-06-29T17:56:33 <kasparnet> yeah, it did indeed
2015-06-29T17:56:34 <colinclark> didn\'t it use to be /user/<token> ?
2015-06-29T17:56:35 <colinclark> aha
2015-06-29T17:56:38 <kasparnet> yeah
2015-06-29T17:56:44 <colinclark> gtirloni probably has old tests
2015-06-29T17:56:49 <kasparnet> oh yeah
2015-06-29T17:56:53 <colinclark> gtirloni: just for the record, kasparnet changed the API ;)
2015-06-29T17:56:57 <colinclark> :P
2015-06-29T17:57:07 <kasparnet> it\'s well documented
2015-06-29T17:57:29 <kasparnet> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/documentation/PreferencesServerFramework.md
2015-06-29T17:57:42 <kasparnet> "colinclark": what? documentation? what is that?
2015-06-29T17:57:45 <colinclark> "rtfm," says\x1c kasparnet
2015-06-29T18:01:01 <gtirloni> ah, /prefereces/elaine worked, connecting to the prefs server.. cool :)
2015-06-29T18:01:13 <gtirloni> the tests are connecting to \'rbmm-java\' components and trying \'get /user/elaine\'
2015-06-29T18:01:21 <colinclark> how odd
2015-06-29T18:01:31 <colinclark> they are old and strangely named, i guess
2015-06-29T18:02:29 <gtirloni> i think i\'m using the one from a gist avtar posted here.. not sure it\'s the latest https://gist.github.com/avtar/4a13f34346f9b54a49b4
2015-06-29T18:06:56 <colinclark> gtirloni: I think the preference set in this gist will also need to be updated
2015-06-29T18:07:03 <colinclark> kasparnet: is that your impression as well?
2015-06-29T18:08:49 <kasparnet> yes, definitely! It\'ll need to be updated
2015-06-29T18:08:59 * kasparnet is digging up preferences sets examples
2015-06-29T18:09:22 <kasparnet> gtirloni: here are examples of preferences sets
2015-06-29T18:09:24 <kasparnet> https://github.com/GPII/universal/tree/master/testData/preferences
2015-06-29T18:09:40 <gtirloni> yeah, i seeded the database with those
2015-06-29T18:10:12 <kasparnet> so, if you get them directly from couch or via the "rawPreferences/*" URL, they should stay keyed by the "flat", etc
2015-06-29T18:12:44 <kasparnet> whereas if you\'re getting them from the /preferences/* URL
2015-06-29T18:12:51 <kasparnet> they\'d loose the "flat" part
2015-06-29T18:13:13 <kasparnet> (some of them would be modified a bit if they contain things in a "iso24751" key
2015-06-29T18:13:18 <kasparnet> )*
2015-06-29T18:13:23 <gtirloni> got it, that seems to be how it\'s working
2015-06-29T18:13:34 <gtirloni> i\'ll adjust the tests
2015-06-29T18:13:40 <gtirloni> thanks!
2015-06-29T18:14:25 <kasparnet> gtirloni: no problem
2015-06-29T18:15:01 <kasparnet> btw - dont know whether that\'s supposed to be part of the testing, but to excersize the ontologizer, you can add a parameter, like: http://preferences.gpii.net/preferences/sammy?view=ISO24751 ... which would give you the prefs in a different ontology
2015-06-29T18:15:12 <kasparnet> I\'ll let you and colinclark decide whether that\'s relevant
2015-06-29T18:15:37 <colinclark> kasparnet: Is there some form of ontologization that happens by default?
2015-06-29T18:15:57 <colinclark> you may actually be the best person to advise us on what\'s most relevant to test
2015-06-29T18:16:18 <colinclark> goal wise, gtirloni is trying to run performance benchmarks on the current version of "the preferences server"
2015-06-29T18:16:18 <kasparnet> colinclark: well - by default we always ontologize into the "flat" format
2015-06-29T18:16:22 <colinclark> ok
2015-06-29T18:16:48 <murilocrivellari> hey, michelled: the sonification wiki page is fully updated. What\'s the best way to share it with the community?
2015-06-29T18:16:49 <kasparnet> but since all the prefs are in this format, the ontologization is not really used in the prefs server
2015-06-29T18:17:09 <kasparnet> ... we ARE doing some ontologization more often, but that\'s locally, not on the prefs server
2015-06-29T18:18:18 <colinclark> ok
2015-06-29T18:18:27 <colinclark> probably it\'s best to test "current practice"
2015-06-29T18:18:38 <colinclark> so if the majority of our preferences are flat, we should test those
2015-06-29T18:18:46 <colinclark> and we\'ll see the performance of the ontologizer in the base case
2015-06-29T18:18:53 <michelled> murilocrivellari: great! Maybe send a message for fluid-work asking for some feedback
2015-06-29T18:19:52 <gtirloni> i think i was confused because the old tests seem to be using an architecture that had matchmaker, flow-manager, etc.. but now i see the report mentions only the preferences server. so i guess i was trying to make something much bigger work
2015-06-29T18:19:53 <murilocrivellari> michelled: awesome, will do. Thanks!
2015-06-29T18:20:36 <colinclark> gtirloni: The phase two goal will be to test against the larger architecture
2015-06-29T18:20:50 <colinclark> i.e. to simonjb\'s version of the "secure cloud-based flow manager"
2015-06-29T18:21:13 <colinclark> but for now it\'d be good to get numbers that can directly compare to what michelled had in the document most recently
2015-06-29T18:21:25 <gtirloni> right, yeah.. the playbook i got also includes the secure flow manager..
2015-06-29T18:21:26 <gtirloni> ok got it
2015-06-29T18:21:37 <gtirloni> testing only prefs server

2015-06-29T18:29:44 <michelled> I don\'t think so simonjb
2015-06-29T18:29:55 <simonjb> ok, thanks, I\'ll make one
