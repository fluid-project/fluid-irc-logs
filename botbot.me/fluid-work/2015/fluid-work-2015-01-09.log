b'2015-01-09T20:19:49 <Bosmon> It looks basically good - can you point out a site where you would like to propagate some errors from?
2015-01-09T20:20:35 <Bosmon> Perhaps in "getSelectedPreferences"
2015-01-09T20:20:52 <Bosmon> In general the framework is exception-free - the standard means of signalling an error is to return a rejected promise
2015-01-09T20:21:26 <simonjb> Bosmon: yes getSelectedPreferences or setSelectedPreferences
2015-01-09T20:22:15 <simonjb> Bosmon: do we have an example of signalling an error somewhere that I could have a look at?
2015-01-09T20:23:51 <Bosmon> In general most places in universal itself represent sites where rejections are propagated, rather than generated or handled
2015-01-09T20:24:03 <Bosmon> Since the actual generation or handling code tends to be within Kettle
2015-01-09T20:24:28 <Bosmon> You can see an example of generation here: https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/blob/master/lib/dataSource.js#L363
2015-01-09T20:24:38 <Bosmon> And several others within the same file
2015-01-09T20:25:34 <Bosmon> You can see the handling code at the far end here:
2015-01-09T20:25:35 <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/blob/master/lib/request.js#L99
2015-01-09T20:25:55 <Bosmon> Which eventually punches through to here: https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/blob/master/lib/request.js#L207
2015-01-09T20:27:39 <Bosmon> I imagine we should probably standardise somewhat on "rejection payloads" - our current standard is for it to have a field holding isError: true, and a string member named message holding some error text
2015-01-09T20:28:23 <Bosmon> Of course you\'re free to add whatever other fields you like that would help with signalling via the API
2015-01-09T20:29:34 <simonjb> Bosmon: ok, will take a look
2015-01-09T20:30:05 <simonjb> Bosmon: I\'d also like to write acceptance tests for this new API and am feeling a little unsure where to start
2015-01-09T20:30:46 <simonjb> Bosmon: I\'d need to login, authorize, and then call this api
2015-01-09T20:30:53 <Bosmon> simonjb - sure
2015-01-09T20:31:14 <Bosmon> A reasonable model for "manual" kinds of server tests is probably https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/blob/master/tests/CrossServerRequestTests.js
2015-01-09T20:31:37 <Bosmon> It constructs all of its servers by hand rather than using the automated Kettle definitions
2015-01-09T20:31:53 <Bosmon> So you could just replace subcomponents such as this one, for example https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/blob/master/tests/CrossServerRequestTests.js#L141 with your own server component which is under test
2015-01-09T20:32:12 <Justin_o> cindyli: I\'ve set cacheing for the selection tree template
2015-01-09T20:32:27 <Justin_o> it\'s pushed up to my GPII-1033 and GPII-1051 branches
2015-01-09T20:32:31 <Bosmon> And then you can embed this tree inside a "testEnvironment" like so: https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/blob/master/tests/CrossServerRequestTests.js#L246
2015-01-09T20:33:20 <Bosmon> This has one subcomponent for each kind of HTTP request you would like to issue, and then one called "fixtures" holding each of the various sequences you want to test
2015-01-09T20:33:51 <simonjb> Bosmon: ok, thanks, will take a look
2015-01-09T20:34:02 <cindyli> ok, thanks, Justin_o
2015-01-09T20:34:17 <Bosmon> The only dependence on Kettle you\'d need would be for the HTTP request components of type "kettle.test.request.http"
2015-01-09T20:34:37 <Bosmon> Everything else would be just a dependence on Infusion
2015-01-09T20:37:42 <simonjb> thanks Bosmon, while I have you how is it going with the preferences filtering?
2015-01-09T20:38:07 <Bosmon> One aspect that might be awkward is ensuring that your server is properly shut down between fixtures - eventually we will be able to want these to run in sequence and it can be very hazardous is a server is left lingering listening on a port when the next fixture is running
2015-01-09T20:38:27 <Bosmon> And there seem to be some oddities with express that sometimes it doesn\'t shut servers down very cleanly
2015-01-09T20:38:49 * yzen is now known as yzen_
2015-01-09T20:38:57 <Bosmon> So you might just design your tests to be run in isolation for now - that is, with just one server per run from the command line
2015-01-09T20:39:31 <Bosmon> simonjb - moderately well, unfortunately I am needing to do a lot of refactoring in order to get the filtering code introduced in the right place
2015-01-09T20:39:41 <Bosmon> The matchmaker workflow has become rather tangled over time
2015-01-09T20:40:04 <simonjb> ok, I\'m glad it\'s you doing it :)
2015-01-09T20:40:14 <Bosmon> So I am basically discarding the old workflow and replacing it with an instance of our promise sequence transformer instead
2015-01-09T20:40:45 <Bosmon> As well as changing the format of all the payloads that the old functions handed around in order to make them a bit more stable and predictable...
2015-01-09T20:41:14 <Bosmon> There were plenty of instances where the same arguments were referred to by several different names in different functions, which made understanding the workflow extremely confusing
2015-01-09T20:42:28 <Bosmon> For example the same member referred to as "device", "deviceContext", "deviceReporter", etc.
2015-01-09T20:42:52 <Bosmon> In the new model, every function accepts and returns exactly one argument, which has the useful effect of forcing everyone to agree on all the names : P
2015-01-09T20:43:27 <cindyli> simon, i\'ve pushed all the changes to my 1060 branch
2015-01-09T20:43:34 <simonjb> thanks cindyli
2015-01-09T20:43:39 <cindyli> np
2015-01-09T20:48:06 <Bosmon> I had been expecting to be done today, but in the end I launched into a rather more ambitious refactoring than I\'d been expecting
2015-01-09T20:48:12 <Bosmon> It should be running by tomorrow I think
2015-01-09T20:49:05 <simonjb> Bosmon: by tomorrow, that\'s great -- it\'s all coming together
2015-01-09T20:49:26 <cindyli> simonjb: i\'ve fixed styling of the privacy settings page and pushed up to my 1060 branch
2015-01-09T20:53:01 <cindyli> hi Bosmon, if i\'m using new relay components for a parent and a child components, can i still in one component, manually call applier.change() to request model changes on another component? or it can only be done via model relay?
2015-01-09T20:53:31 <Bosmon> cindyli - you shouldn\'t call methods on another component\'s applier, no
2015-01-09T20:53:50 <cindyli> no success. that\'s true
2015-01-09T20:54:31 <Bosmon> Can you give me an example of the situation?
2015-01-09T20:55:08 <cindyli> digging example code
2015-01-09T20:56:21 <cindyli> Bosmon: https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/GPII-1060/gpii/node_modules/gpii-oauth2/gpii-oauth2-authz-server/public/src/components/privacySettings/js/EditPrivacySettings.js#L220-L229
2015-01-09T20:56:50 <cindyli> the model listener converts every model change on the selection tree to a format that can be accepted by the server
2015-01-09T20:57:16 <cindyli> this converted value needs to be escalated to the parent component for sending server requests
2015-01-09T20:57:46 <Bosmon> cindyli - this is a very strange definition : P
2015-01-09T20:58:13 <Bosmon> Why is "toServerModel" held within an expander?
2015-01-09T20:58:54 <Bosmon> And why are you ignoring the actual model value which is supplied to the listener?
2015-01-09T20:59:28 <Bosmon> typo on line 202
2015-01-09T21:00:00 <cindyli> sharp eyes
2015-01-09T21:00:08 <Bosmon> Also line 73
2015-01-09T21:00:19 <cindyli> the actual model value is automatically passed into the toServerModel
2015-01-09T21:00:46 <Bosmon> cindyli - this will never work
2015-01-09T21:00:58 <cindyli> what??!!
2015-01-09T21:00:59 <Bosmon> expanders are evaluated only once in general
2015-01-09T21:01:08 <cindyli> it works
2015-01-09T21:01:13 <Bosmon> You should just use the model value that you have already got supplied as an argument
2015-01-09T21:01:21 <Bosmon> Well if it does, it shouldn\'t : P
2015-01-09T21:01:31 <cindyli> haha
2015-01-09T21:02:22 <Bosmon> Future versions of the framework will consider they are entitled to cache IoC-resolved values after the first call
2015-01-09T21:02:42 <Bosmon> You may actually find that this listener only works the first time
2015-01-09T21:03:30 <Bosmon> cindyli - you should source all the model values that you use from the arguments to the listener function
2015-01-09T21:03:55 <cindyli> ok, i see what u mean
2015-01-09T21:05:38 <Bosmon> cindyli - this function is also faulty - https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/GPII-1060/gpii/node_modules/gpii-oauth2/gpii-oauth2-authz-server/public/src/components/privacySettings/js/EditPrivacySettings.js#L180
2015-01-09T21:06:15 <Bosmon> The component should be using a model, rather than setting material on the instance directly using fluid.set
2015-01-09T21:06:50 <cindyli> i totally agree, i was using model, but having issues that mentioned earlier. this is the work around
2015-01-09T21:07:07 * yzen_ is now known as yzen
2015-01-09T21:07:32 <cindyli> maybe it was the expander issue causing problem. in the middle of fixing expander first, will try switch to using model after that, Bosmon
2015-01-09T21:15:58 <cindyli> Bosmon: made the change where the manual applier change issue is successfully reproduced. the new model listener: https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/GPII-1060/gpii/node_modules/gpii-oauth2/gpii-oauth2-authz-server/public/src/components/privacySettings/js/EditPrivacySettings.js#L224-L227
2015-01-09T21:16:34 <Bosmon> cindyli - still very puzzled by the {that}.toServerModel reference
2015-01-09T21:16:34 <cindyli> in the model listener function, the converted value for server is fired via https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/GPII-1060/gpii/node_modules/gpii-oauth2/gpii-oauth2-authz-server/public/src/components/privacySettings/js/EditPrivacySettings.js#L253
2015-01-09T21:17:23 <cindyli> toServerModel is the function provided by the selectionTree component to convert its internal model structure to the format that can be accepted by the server
2015-01-09T21:18:14 <Bosmon> cindyli - ok - surely that is your job, rather than the component\'s job
2015-01-09T21:18:31 <Bosmon> Your component is the one which deals with communication with the server
2015-01-09T21:19:11 <Bosmon> So I don\'t see any reason for that function to be defined with the selection tree and defined as its member
2015-01-09T21:19:17 <cindyli> yes, but selectionTree component is also suppose to accept and OUTPUT the server format data
2015-01-09T21:19:27 <Bosmon> cindyli - who said that it was? : P
2015-01-09T21:19:36 <Bosmon> It\'s job is just to be a selection tree
2015-01-09T21:20:04 <Bosmon> So, in any case - what are you observing now
2015-01-09T21:20:21 <cindyli> the line 253 never triggers the model change
2015-01-09T21:20:46 <Bosmon> cindyli - how do you know?
2015-01-09T21:20:50 <cindyli> i have a "console.log" at line 208
2015-01-09T21:20:58 <cindyli> it\'s never triggered
2015-01-09T21:21:00 <Bosmon> ok
2015-01-09T21:21:11 <Bosmon> Do the preferences actually differ from the values which existed before?
2015-01-09T21:21:26 <cindyli> not never, it\'s triggered at initializing, not afterwards from the sub component
2015-01-09T21:21:32 <cindyli> different
2015-01-09T21:21:48 <Bosmon> You should try logging that.model.selectedPrefs on line 252
2015-01-09T21:21:54 <Bosmon> As well as the ones which you convert
2015-01-09T21:22:05 <cindyli> ok
2015-01-09T21:22:59 <cindyli> tracked, different values, Bosmon
2015-01-09T21:23:17 <Bosmon> ok
2015-01-09T21:24:00 <Bosmon> I guess it isn\'t possible to try this component out without running a server :(
2015-01-09T21:24:41 <cindyli> i tried using non relay components, it worked
2015-01-09T21:24:56 <cindyli> with server of course
2015-01-09T21:25:26 <Bosmon> cindyli - ok - it\'s fine to convert to non-relay components for now
2015-01-09T21:25:43 <cindyli> well, i was using model relay somewhere else
2015-01-09T21:25:52 <Bosmon> Can you produce a JIRA for the issue, and perhaps when we have time after the review, produce a standalone test case?
2015-01-09T21:26:00 <cindyli> sure
2015-01-09T21:26:28 <cindyli> i should have some time to create both next Monday
2015-01-09T21:28:23 <Bosmon> Cool
2015-01-09T21:28:36 <Bosmon> Perhaps we can get by without relay in this tree for now, if we can\'t deal with it quickly
2015-01-09T21:28:40 <Bosmon> I would suspect that http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5498 is related
2015-01-09T21:29:22 <cindyli> ah ha
2015-01-09T21:29:57 * Sepideh has quit
2015-01-09T21:31:35 <cindyli> Bosmon: i\'m thinking to use the relay components with the work around of saving as a member options instead of a model value. I\'m using model relay in btw the edit component and the privacy page. what do you think?
2015-01-09T21:33:37 <Bosmon> cindyli - ok...
2015-01-09T21:33:45 <cindyli> cool. thanks, Bosmon
2015-01-09T21:33:53 <Bosmon> If you can write up the JIRA, you can add the reference to the affected code in a comment
2015-01-09T21:35:32 <cindyli> Bosmon: i will try to create a test case to go along with the jira. the affected code i guess is being removed right now since it doesn\'t work ;)
2015-01-09T21:35:46 <Bosmon> cindyli - cheers
2015-01-09T21:35:55 <Bosmon> We\'ll have a lot of model relay work to pick up after the review...
2015-01-09T21:36:05 <Bosmon> cindyli - I meant as a comment applied to the workaround code
2015-01-09T21:36:44 <cindyli> sure

2015-01-09T15:43:29 <cindyli> thanks, Justin_o
2015-01-09T15:47:58 <Bosmon> Hey kasparne_ - I\'ve started my refactoring now so do ping me if you are starting any contextManager work
2015-01-09T15:48:09 <Bosmon> I\'ll ping you with my updated branch once I have the changes working again
2015-01-09T15:49:20 <Bosmon> I\'ve successfully removed the "matchmakingRequest" grade from UserUpdate and combined the argument fired from matchMakerDispatcher into a single object
2015-01-09T15:49:33 <Bosmon> And everything is working for now, just light refactoring and renaming so far
2015-01-09T15:53:17 <kasparne_> hey Bosmon
2015-01-09T15:53:30 <kasparne_> I have indeed started some context work
2015-01-09T15:53:34 <kasparne_> (a while back actually)
2015-01-09T15:53:57 <kasparne_> (just looking for the branch)
2015-01-09T15:54:36 <kasparne_> https://github.com/kaspermarkus/universal/tree/GPII-795
2015-01-09T15:55:04 <kasparne_> but it\'s quite limited in testcases - I have some more in a branch, but am having some issues with it
2015-01-09T15:55:11 <kasparne_> ... anyway, I dont think it affects the flow too much
2015-01-09T15:55:26 <kasparne_> it mostly changes the current placeholder function
2015-01-09T15:55:40 <kasparne_> so I think you can just go ahead with the filtering functionality
2015-01-09T15:57:56 * anastasiac joined the channel
2015-01-09T16:05:23 <Bosmon> kasparne_ - looks like quite a few changes
2015-01-09T16:05:30 <Bosmon> What kind of problems did you run into?
2015-01-09T16:05:45 <Bosmon> Let me know when you are planning to work on this again and we can look at it

2015-01-09T12:57:11 <Bosmon> kasparnet
2015-01-09T12:57:25 <kasparnet> Bosmon\'nnnn
2015-01-09T12:57:32 <kasparnet> nananananananana
2015-01-09T12:57:34 <kasparnet> BOSMON!
2015-01-09T12:57:46 <Bosmon> dinnerdinnerdinnerdinner : P
2015-01-09T12:57:53 <kasparnet> nananananananananananananananana bosmon
2015-01-09T12:57:58 <kasparnet> heh ok
2015-01-09T12:58:05 <kasparnet> I\'ll still be around when you get back
2015-01-09T12:58:14 <Bosmon> no I was just making this noise
2015-01-09T12:58:16 <Bosmon> It is not dinnertime
2015-01-09T12:58:21 <kasparnet> haha ok
2015-01-09T12:58:21 <Bosmon> It\'s not even breakfast time yet : P
2015-01-09T12:58:25 <kasparnet> lol
2015-01-09T12:58:40 <Bosmon> So I wanted to give you a headsup that I am going to be refactoring the architecture to support the preferences filtering a bit
2015-01-09T12:58:58 <kasparnet> oh cool
2015-01-09T12:59:08 <Bosmon> We have this very tangled workflow that starts with the call mysteriously called "matchMaker.preProcess"
2015-01-09T12:59:13 <kasparnet> (and "oooooh scary" as well)
2015-01-09T12:59:21 <Bosmon> Which of course is the thing that in fact initiates the entire process
2015-01-09T12:59:30 <Bosmon> And ends with the mysterious dispatch in and out of the contextManager
2015-01-09T12:59:46 <Bosmon> I am going to flatten this out so that it all gets operated by a single event
2015-01-09T13:00:01 <Bosmon> because otherwise it will make too much of a shitheap inserting an extra filtering process in the middle of it
2015-01-09T13:00:28 <Bosmon> Hopefully it won\'t make too much of a mess, but I know you\'ll be working on the context-aware server this week so we should be aware there might be conflicts
2015-01-09T13:01:48 <Bosmon> But I\'ll also have to change the signature of the argument fired by gpii.matchMakerFramework.matchMakerDispatcher so that it just consists of a single object rather than two
2015-01-09T13:07:19 <kasparnet> Bosmon: I think that should be ok - as long as we dont change the API the faces the MMs (within the matchMakerDispatcher functioN), ie. whatever is sent in the .set and expected back from it -
2015-01-09T13:14:53 <Bosmon> cheers kasparnet - yes, we\'ll keep all the external APIs the same
2015-01-09T13:15:06 <kasparnet> awesome! Thanks antranig
2015-01-09T13:15:24 <Bosmon> You may have noticed this USEFUL API appearing in Infusion
2015-01-09T13:15:25 <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/core/js/FluidPromises.js#L225
2015-01-09T13:15:32 <Bosmon> Which at the moment is used to operate our dataSources
2015-01-09T13:15:51 <Bosmon> My plan is to use it to organise our filtering chain for the matchmaking process too
2015-01-09T13:16:05 <Bosmon> Using a new "pseudoevent" called something like "processMatch"
2015-01-09T13:20:19 * Justin_o joined the channel
2015-01-09T13:23:31 <kasparnet> Bosmon: that\'s awesome
2015-01-09T13:23:34 <kasparnet> and really fancy
2015-01-09T13:24:22 <Bosmon> Although calling it an "event" might be a bit confusing, I think it will make our control flow a lot easier to understand
2015-01-09T13:24:35 <Bosmon> Right now you have to hop back and forth between half a dozen files and see what calls what
2015-01-09T13:24:56 <Bosmon> As well as making it easier for people to add and remove optional parts of the processing such as filtering....
2015-01-09T13:38:47 <Bosmon> Oh kasparnet... one other thing
2015-01-09T13:38:53 <Bosmon> I was looking at the UserUpdate request handler
2015-01-09T13:38:54 <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/core/js/FluidPromises.js#L225
2015-01-09T13:39:05 <Bosmon> And I noticed it had the so-called grade "userToken"
2015-01-09T13:39:49 <Bosmon> So in our current OAauth2-aware branch this grade got renamed to "matchMakingRequest"
2015-01-09T13:39:50 <Bosmon> https://github.com/amb26/universal/blob/GPII-17/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/src/UserUpdate.js#L26
2015-01-09T13:40:01 <Bosmon> Which made it a little clearer to me that this grade actually isn\'t used by the request at all
2015-01-09T13:40:16 <Bosmon> because we don\'t (any longer?) do any matchMaking during the update request
2015-01-09T13:40:29 <Bosmon> So one would think it would be ok to remove this grade
2015-01-09T13:40:35 <Bosmon> Does that seem reasonable?
