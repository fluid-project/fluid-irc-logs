2015-06-15T21:24:51 <jhernandez> I've just updated it, and it wasn't that diffucult
2015-06-15T21:26:04 <jhernandez> since we're only facing such problem with the 'clients' object, the component is now a modelRealyComponent and we can make use of its capabilities with the 'settings' object
2015-06-15T21:26:46 <jhernandez> and, the 'clients' object is being handled manually

2015-06-15T18:26:54 <Justin_o> In short I wasn\'t sure how exactly to implement your suggestion
2015-06-15T18:27:07 <Justin_o> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/566#discussion_r21262334
2015-06-15T18:30:37 * the-t-in-rtf joined the channel
2015-06-15T18:34:18 <Bosmon> jhernandez - VVANTTUNNEZZ!
2015-06-15T18:35:47 <Justin_o> jhung: is this something you can address with your current ILDH work? https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5317
2015-06-15T18:37:04 <simonjb> hi Bosmon, Bosmon8, would you be available for some consultation on the Infusion tooltip component?
2015-06-15T18:39:30 <jhung> @Justin_o sure. I\'ll add that to the iteration plan page
2015-06-15T18:39:55 <Justin_o> jhung: thanks
2015-06-15T18:40:45 * the-t-in-rtf has quit
2015-06-15T18:41:53 <jhernandez> Bosmon: ANTVANIQUE!!!!!
2015-06-15T18:43:09 <Bosmon> simonjb - sure
2015-06-15T18:44:16 <Bosmon> jhernandez - I cleared out my modules and did an npm install, and it is still working fine for me in my branch
2015-06-15T18:44:37 <Bosmon> I hope you are not doing something reckless like using a node 0.12 version or something : P
2015-06-15T18:44:38 <simonjb> Bosmon: awesome! I\'ve been looking at https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5607 and started with point "- remove the "initialised" member workflow and replace with a framework facility" referenced in the tooltip code at https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/components/tooltip/js/Tooltip.js#L130
2015-06-15T18:45:21 <simonjb> Bosmon: I was looking at the code for FLUID-4890
2015-06-15T18:45:34 <simonjb> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/commit/f5403d5027923475e0c4314005f6723d2e732759
2015-06-15T18:45:36 <Bosmon> simonjb - I think this issue is best shelved until colinclark gets back to do the framework merge
2015-06-15T18:45:44 <jhernandez> Bosmon: nope, clean node_modules, npm installed again, still the same problem
2015-06-15T18:45:50 <simonjb> Bosmon: ah, good to know
2015-06-15T18:46:08 <jhernandez> and I\'ve just tried it with 0.10.38 and I\'m getting into the same problem
2015-06-15T18:46:10 <Bosmon> There are too many changes upcoming to work on something as delicate as this
2015-06-15T18:46:47 <simonjb> Bosmon: how about https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5672
2015-06-15T18:47:11 <Bosmon> jhernandez - well, how can it be explained!
2015-06-15T18:47:17 <Bosmon> jhernandez - so, you are checking out my branch at https://github.com/amb26/universal/tree/GPII-989
2015-06-15T18:47:20 * jhung1 joined the channel
2015-06-15T18:47:32 <Bosmon> And you are running node WebSocketsSettingsHandlerTests.js
2015-06-15T18:47:35 <Bosmon> And it is not passing for you?
2015-06-15T18:48:02 <Bosmon> simonjb - that seems more doable, yes
2015-06-15T18:48:35 <simonjb> thanks Bosmon
2015-06-15T18:48:43 <jhernandez> Bosmon: WebSocketsSettingsHandlerTests.js passes well
2015-06-15T18:49:09 <Bosmon> simonjb - another useful piece of work would be to adjust the implementation so that it automatically skips disabled DOM nodes in fluid.tooltip.resolveTooltipTarget
2015-06-15T18:49:11 <Bosmon> simonjb - https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/components/tooltip/js/Tooltip.js#L61
2015-06-15T18:49:19 <Bosmon> This was something that we hacked in the FD tool at the last moment
2015-06-15T18:49:29 * jhung has quit
2015-06-15T18:49:30 <jhernandez> Bosmon: I\'m getting the problem when running the BrowserChannel
2015-06-15T18:49:48 <jhernandez> s/BrowserChannel/BrowserChannelTests
2015-06-15T18:50:22 <Bosmon> but it requires the implementor to explicitly add the wacky :not([disabled]) annotation at the end of the tooltip items selector
2015-06-15T18:50:24 <Bosmon> simonjb: https://github.com/fluid-project/first-discovery/blob/master/src/js/firstDiscoveryEditor.js#L129
2015-06-15T18:50:31 <Bosmon> jhernandez aha ok
2015-06-15T19:03:38 <Bosmon> Ok jhernandez - it looks like the issue is that you are trying to put a socket.io socket object into a model
2015-06-15T19:04:04 <Bosmon> The socket object is a crazily circularly-linked heap of junk
2015-06-15T19:04:15 * danaayotte joined the channel
2015-06-15T19:06:18 <jhernandez> yup
2015-06-15T19:06:22 <jhernandez> sorry for that
2015-06-15T19:06:24 <jhernandez> :P
2015-06-15T19:07:45 <Bosmon> jhernandez - well, it is me that is sorry
2015-06-15T19:07:55 <Bosmon> I\'m sorry to have wasted so much of your time with this : P
2015-06-15T19:08:09 <Bosmon> I think the best thing is to stop trying to use fluid.modelComponent
2015-06-15T19:08:21 <Bosmon> We can\'t really support "models" with this kind of thing in them
2015-06-15T19:08:34 <Bosmon> I suggest that you just fall back to the use of fluid.get/fluid.set together with path arrays
2015-06-15T19:08:39 <Bosmon> And do everything else using conventional events
2015-06-15T19:09:29 <jhernandez> ok
2015-06-15T19:09:48 <Bosmon> At least you can get rid of all the awful escaping/unescaping utilities
2015-06-15T19:10:05 <Bosmon> And then you won\'t have to do anything when the framework is upgraded either
2015-06-15T19:10:47 <jhernandez> yup, will move it then
2015-06-15T19:10:56 <jhernandez> thanks for helping me on this
2015-06-15T19:10:58 <jhernandez> :)
2015-06-15T19:18:29 * danaayotte has quit
2015-06-15T19:19:09 <Bosmon> jhernandez - you might want to knock up a little gpii.delete utility in 5 lines, to go with fluid.get and fluid.set
2015-06-15T19:19:14 <Bosmon> jhernandez - here is a sample: https://github.com/amb26/infusion/blob/FLUID-5249/src/framework/core/js/Fluid.js#L2151
2015-06-15T19:19:25 * clown joined the channel
2015-06-15T19:19:27 <Bosmon> The section from lines 2151 to line 2158
2015-06-15T19:20:01 <Bosmon> Well, I guess since delete is a keyword you might want gpii.deleteValue
2015-06-15T19:27:50 <Bosmon> jhernandez - I wrote up your issue at https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5690

2015-06-15T19:49:08 <Bosmon> Justin_o - I\'ve allocated "1.9" as a version number in the JIRA project, in order to describe the version of infusion\'s current trunk that hoepfully we might tag this week
2015-06-15T19:49:16 <Bosmon> Even if we don\'t turn it into an official release
2015-06-15T19:49:51 <Bosmon> My thoughts were, if we succeeded in getting a CI server up with Alan\'s help after that, we would start semver numbering subsequent infusion releases as 1.10.x - what do you think?
2015-06-15T19:50:18 <Bosmon> That is, those releases that we made on the progress of our roadmap before 2.0
2015-06-15T19:50:56 <Bosmon> Another possibility is to just label this week\'s "non-release" as 1.6 or 1.8, and then move to 1.7 or 1.9 .........
2015-06-15T20:00:43 <michelled> Bosmon: if we are going to tag, I think we should do a test cycle
2015-06-15T20:01:04 <michelled> we haven\'t done one for a while, and a tag would imply that we are confident in the version
2015-06-15T20:09:34 <Bosmon> michelled - It needn\'t, if we didn\'t want it to
2015-06-15T20:09:51 <Bosmon> I just think we need to mark this point in time somehow, in case we need to refer to it again
2015-06-15T20:10:08 <Bosmon> Only an actual release implies that we are confident in the version :)
2015-06-15T20:13:36 <Bosmon> Justin_o - do our tests really pass in IE11? : P
