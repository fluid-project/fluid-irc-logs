2015-05-13T19:27:53 <colinclark> It sounds to me like, unless it's broken, if you have a working GPII installation, sgithens______, you should be able to key into it, open up the PMT, and it will know who is currently logged in and show their preference set

2015-05-13T13:46:57 <colinclark> Hey Justin_o, do you have time for a quick question?
2015-05-13T13:47:06 * sepideh joined the channel
2015-05-13T13:47:08 <Justin_o> colinclark: sure
2015-05-13T13:47:39 <colinclark> Is there any technical reason why the Preferences Framework would make it difficult for someone to implement the feature in the PMT where it can load and edit an existing preference set?
2015-05-13T13:50:18 <Justin_o> colinclark: I think it would require the "store" used to be able to handle that sort of thing. cindyli what do you think?
2015-05-13T13:51:24 <Justin_o> colinclark: i don\'t believe any of our existing ones would handle that out of the box, so you\'d have to reconfigure one or create  new one. I don\'t think the PMT uses any of the stores from Infusion anyways though.
2015-05-13T13:51:59 <colinclark> When you say "handle that sort of thing," can you elaborate a tiny bit, just so I understand?
2015-05-13T13:52:54 <Justin_o> colinclark: meaning that it can point at different sets of preferences
2015-05-13T13:53:03 <Justin_o> unless the store has all of the prefs sets in it already
2015-05-13T13:53:23 <Justin_o> then it would just be to change the mapping so that it knows which internal set to point at
2015-05-13T13:54:09 <Justin_o> and then we\'d need to update the model in the prefsFramework based on this new stored value
2015-05-13T13:54:11 * sepideh joined the channel
2015-05-13T13:54:14 <Justin_o> cindyli: does that all seem correct
2015-05-13T13:54:19 <colinclark> Does it look like this Store implementation has the ability to fetch preferences? https://github.com/GPII/prefsEditors/blob/review3/src/shared/common/GpiiStore.js#L119-L180
2015-05-13T13:55:08 <cindyli> yes, Justin_o, colinclark, creating users\' own gpiiStore should be the way to go
2015-05-13T13:57:01 <Justin_o> colinclark: i guess that might depend on how these things are persisted in the GPII preferences server
2015-05-13T13:57:17 <colinclark> What do you mean, Justin_o?
2015-05-13T13:57:29 <Justin_o> are they all stored in one record, or can you get access to the different sets by the URL
2015-05-13T13:58:35 <colinclark> You mean like this? http://preferences.gpii.net/preferences/sammy
2015-05-13T13:58:43 <Justin_o> if it\'s the former, you\'d probably do something here https://github.com/GPII/prefsEditors/blob/review3/src/shared/common/GpiiStore.js#L170
2015-05-13T13:58:59 * danaayotte joined the channel
2015-05-13T13:59:36 <Justin_o> colinclark: so when you say preferences sets you mean different contexts?
2015-05-13T14:00:04 <Justin_o> and user might have many contexts returned?
2015-05-13T14:00:31 <colinclark> When I say Preference Sets, I mean "the JSON document containing all of the user\'s needs and preferences, including those in different contexts"
2015-05-13T14:00:52 <Justin_o> colinclark: so you mean switching between sammy and some other user?
2015-05-13T14:01:00 <colinclark> yes
2015-05-13T14:01:14 <colinclark> I am trying to unpack Nikos\' email to sgithens______ on the mailing list
2015-05-13T14:01:24 <colinclark> where he seems to be saying that the PMT has no ability to load an existing document
2015-05-13T14:01:27 <colinclark> only create new ones
2015-05-13T14:02:41 <Justin_o> colinclark: that\'s strange... it should be able to load existing ones, or else we wouldn\'t be able to reload the tool.. so it definitely used to work.
2015-05-13T14:02:52 <Justin_o> anyways, i think you\'d just change this line https://github.com/GPII/prefsEditors/blob/review3/src/shared/common/GpiiStore.js#L162
2015-05-13T14:02:54 <colinclark> ok, maybe there\'s just confusion
2015-05-13T14:03:16 <Justin_o> it seems to be loading in the logged in user, which makes sense
2015-05-13T14:03:25 <colinclark> right
2015-05-13T14:03:26 <Justin_o> so maybe he\'s having a problem logging in/out users?
2015-05-13T14:03:32 <colinclark> I think so
2015-05-13T14:04:09 <colinclark> maybe that\'s just the issue--that sgithens______ just needs to key into the GPII and then open his PMT and it should know who the current user is already
2015-05-13T14:04:48 <Justin_o> colinclark: yes, probably. Last I checked, PMT didn\'t have a way of logging in a user outside of creating one itself
2015-05-13T14:04:56 <colinclark> ah, yes
2015-05-13T14:05:04 <Justin_o> the logging in had been expected to be done by the USB or RFID i think
2015-05-13T14:05:07 <colinclark> ok, so that\'s the key question
2015-05-13T14:05:23 <colinclark> if the user is keyed into the Flow Manager, though, you expect that the PMT should know about it?
2015-05-13T14:05:31 <Justin_o> yes
2015-05-13T14:05:33 <colinclark> ok
2015-05-13T14:05:36 <colinclark> this is making more sense
2015-05-13T14:05:41 <colinclark> thanks!
2015-05-13T14:05:42 <Justin_o> there was an url added to get the logged in user
2015-05-13T14:05:47 <colinclark> right
2015-05-13T14:06:08 <colinclark> and I guess, as you say, sgithens______ could, if he wanted, extend the way the PMT works to take the user token from the URL, for example
2015-05-13T14:06:53 <Justin_o> colinclark: yep, he\'d just need to change how the logged in user is set, or change how the url to the preferences server is constructed
2015-05-13T14:07:16 <Justin_o> how the PMT recognizes the logged in user that is
2015-05-13T14:08:02 <colinclark> yep
2015-05-13T14:08:03 <colinclark> ok
2015-05-13T14:08:07 <colinclark> thanks so much for clarifying, Justin_o
2015-05-13T14:08:10 <colinclark> I really appreciate it
2015-05-13T14:08:45 <Justin_o> colinclark: np, glad i could help
