2015-03-04T22:16:26 <sgithens______> Can someone post the notes from today\'s arch meeting: http://wiki.gpii.net/w/Arch_Meeting_Notes
2015-03-04T22:17:51 <kasparnet> hey sgithens______ finding and updating now
2015-03-04T22:18:10 <sgithens______> thanks kasparnet!
2015-03-04T22:19:04 <kasparnet> sgithens______: ok, page updated with link to the minutes (which is here as well, btw: http://piratepad.net/c4a-arch-04-03-2015 )
2015-03-04T22:19:28 <kasparnet> sgithens______: this was about the device reporter stuff on the windows side
2015-03-04T22:19:37 <sgithens______> kasparnet: Sweet. Any notes online from the hackaton?
2015-03-04T22:19:40 <kasparnet> not how sure you actually got with it when looking at it
2015-03-04T22:19:52 <sgithens______> perfect
2015-03-04T22:20:10 <sgithens______> As soon as the universal device reporter bit is ready again, I\'ll bring the windows stuff back up to date
2015-03-04T22:20:36 <kasparnet> nope - not really.. the hack-part was mostly in relation to the OER accessibility sprint (and not particularly relevant for our regular work) ... We did have a bit of meetings
2015-03-04T22:20:52 <kasparnet> mostly in relation to security
2015-03-04T22:21:05 <kasparnet> which simon is in the process of translating into readable notes
2015-03-04T22:21:21 <sgithens______> cool. You guys talked about the solutions registry format and about the inverse settings handler thing right?
2015-03-04T22:21:51 <sgithens______> Curious about the outcome convos from those particularly
2015-03-04T22:26:07 <kasparnet> Antranig and I discussed the registry format
2015-03-04T22:26:22 <kasparnet> but it ended up mostly being a confirmation about the format listed at the bottom of this document
2015-03-04T22:27:05 <kasparnet> piratepad.net/ep/pad/view/c4a-arch-29-10-2014/UK4CwimNsN
2015-03-04T22:27:25 <kasparnet> http://piratepad.net/ep/pad/view/c4a-arch-29-10-2014/UK4CwimNsN
2015-03-04T22:28:25 <kasparnet> and a confirmation that we can split the work up, so that the fixing of current start/stop blocks and the devicereporter stuff can happen simoultaneously
2015-03-04T22:28:54 <kasparnet> sgithens______:
2015-03-04T22:29:29 <sgithens______> awesome
2015-03-04T22:29:36 <kasparnet> we didn\'t talk much about inverse settingshandlers (although, I seem to remember that you have a unique HENSesque interpretation of what an inverse settingshandler is)
2015-03-04T22:29:50 <kasparnet> sgithens______: how\'s CSUN going, btw?
2015-03-04T22:30:03 <kasparnet> shame we all couldn\'t be there
2015-03-04T22:30:07 <sgithens______> kasparnet: well... I\'m looked through the code on the flight here, and am trying to figure out what to do about it
2015-03-04T22:30:43 <sgithens______> I"m assuming it needs to get fixed, but if not, it seems like they should at least be in the solutions entry for each product, and not in the single large hidden son file
2015-03-04T22:30:47 <sgithens______> pretty good
2015-03-04T22:30:51 * anastasiac has quit
2015-03-04T22:31:02 <sgithens______> there weren\'t a ton of people at our session unfortunately, but it went well
2015-03-04T22:31:12 <sgithens______> I went to the windows 10 session :p
2015-03-04T22:31:35 <kasparnet> glad it went well despise the lack of people
2015-03-04T22:31:38 <sgithens______> and spoke to the program manager afterwards about the need to keep making more things swappable without logging in and out all the damn time
2015-03-04T22:31:40 <kasparnet> how was windows 10?
2015-03-04T22:31:47 <kasparnet> oh cool
2015-03-04T22:31:54 <kasparnet> what did he/she say about that?
2015-03-04T22:31:57 <sgithens______> I\'m going to download the last preview release
2015-03-04T22:32:18 <sgithens______> he agreed, and chatted a bit about the internal issues related to it
2015-03-04T22:32:37 <kasparnet> ok
2015-03-04T22:32:58 <sgithens______> I think it will marginally get better, as it did from win 7 to 8
2015-03-04T22:33:25 <sgithens______> I need to look at UIA, he mentioned that a bunch of time
2015-03-04T22:34:32 <kasparnet> "UIA": Ukraine International Airlines, Understanding Islam Academy, Unemployment Insurance Agency
2015-03-04T22:35:05 <kasparnet> Universitetet i Agder
2015-03-04T22:36:06 <sgithens______> hahahahah
2015-03-04T22:36:17 <sgithens______> I think it\'s User Interface Automater
2015-03-04T22:36:20 <sgithens______> maybe
2015-03-04T22:36:36 <kasparnet> that does sound more likely than my suggestions
2015-03-04T22:36:45 <sgithens______> https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa348551(v=vs.110).aspx
2015-03-04T22:36:57 <sgithens______> oh
2015-03-04T22:36:59 <sgithens______> ok
2015-03-04T22:37:11 <sgithens______> I should write up what I want while we\'re chanign this format
2015-03-04T22:37:52 <sgithens______> it looks like the start and stop aren\'t ordered arrays anymore
2015-03-04T22:38:14 <sgithens______> which could be problematic if you need to run operations before or after you set the settings
2015-03-04T22:38:50 <sgithens______> it might be nice to have names sets of settings handlers too, in case you need to change multiple settings files, with operations in between them (ex. the first time an application is launched)
2015-03-04T22:38:53 <sgithens______> OH God
2015-03-04T22:39:04 <sgithens______> this panel member just referenced Sakai
2015-03-04T22:39:07 <sgithens______> Bosmon
