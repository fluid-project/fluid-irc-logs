2015-05-07T13:21:10 <jhung> I just followed the pattern anastasiac. danaayotte did the heavy lifting. :)

2015-05-07T14:04:19 <cindyli> Bosmon, Justin_o, any idea of unit tests for an enactor that most of it is just to reload a page - https://github.com/cindyli/first-discovery/blob/FLOE-314/src/js/enactors.js#L33
2015-05-07T14:05:52 <Justin_o> cindyli: i guess you could replace the actual reloading part, to make sure the rest of the workflow works
2015-05-07T14:07:00 <cindyli> Justin_o: that\'s a good idea, i can create an invoker for loading page and override it in the unit test. thanks
2015-05-07T14:19:43 <jhung> danaayotte, cindyli, Justin_o, anastasiac: want to chat PGA in 5 mins?
2015-05-07T14:20:07 <cindyli> sure, jhung
2015-05-07T14:20:16 <Justin_o> jhung: sure
2015-05-07T14:20:29 <jhung> Jess_, colinclark, michelled: feel free to join too.

2015-05-07T14:24:29 <Jess_> jhung: awesome
2015-05-07T14:25:44 <michelled> jhung: are you guys tasking now?
2015-05-07T14:25:52 <michelled> I was hoping to be part of that but I have meetings
2015-05-07T14:26:27 <jhung> we can wait until you\'re done michelled. What time will that be?
2015-05-07T14:26:54 <michelled> jhung: I was expecting to meet at 2:00 today
2015-05-07T14:27:04 <michelled> I can do sooner, but then I"ll be remote
2015-05-07T14:28:01 <jhung> Justin_o, anastasiac, danaayotte, cindyli: thoughts? Is meeting later okay?
2015-05-07T14:28:18 <cindyli> fine with me
2015-05-07T14:28:30 <anastasiac> later is good

2015-05-07T15:23:03 <gtirloni> fluid-everyone: our servers have received security patches and bug fix updates today. if you experience any issues, please let me know.
2015-05-07T15:27:10 <Justin_o> danaayotte: do you have designs for the the tooltips on the contrast panel?
2015-05-07T15:29:35 <danaayotte> let me check Justin_o, I don\'t think so
2015-05-07T15:29:56 * Bosmon7 joined the channel
2015-05-07T15:30:09 <Justin_o> danaayotte: i\'ve been working on FLOE-315 which is to get the contrast panel working
2015-05-07T15:30:20 <Jess_> gtirloni: i don\xe2\x80\x99t know what [infra-ops] means but it looks super cool in sq. brackets :)
2015-05-07T15:30:22 <Justin_o> which i\'ve filed a pull request for, but i was going to add the tooltips to it now too
2015-05-07T15:30:32 <Justin_o> but not sure what text and etc to use, also not sure if we need hover tooltips
2015-05-07T15:30:42 <Justin_o> but maybe we do
2015-05-07T15:30:55 <gtirloni> Jess_: lol
2015-05-07T15:31:11 * michelled joined the channel
2015-05-07T15:31:16 <Justin_o> we\'d probably also need designs for how everything should look in contrasts but that work will be done in another jira

2015-05-07T15:47:51 <Justin_o> danaayotte: regarding your standup comments for the tooltip
2015-05-07T15:48:29 <Justin_o> were you suggesting that i do the work in the same pull request, or should i file a new jira. Sounds like you think we\'ll have the designs ready soon, but wanted to double check.
2015-05-07T15:49:32 <danaayotte> Justin_o why don\'t you go ahead and file a new jira so it doesn\'t hold back the other work
2015-05-07T15:49:44 <Justin_o> danaayotte: okay, will do.. thanks
2015-05-07T15:50:17 <danaayotte> thanks jhung let me take a look at what we\'ve got first

2015-05-07T20:30:05 <jhung> Justin_o, cindyli - I found a bug with the first discovery tool. It appears that the tooltip is blocking the mouse click on the Voice ON/OFF button even though the tooltip is not visually rendered.

2015-05-07T20:35:21 <jhung> sure cindyli.
