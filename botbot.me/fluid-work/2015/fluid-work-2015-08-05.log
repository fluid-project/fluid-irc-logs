2015-08-05T17:18:16 <Justin_o> michelled: okay
2015-08-05T17:18:19 <sepidehshahi> ok:)
2015-08-05T17:18:28 <maozillah> errh i\xe2\x80\x99m not here on mondays :o
2015-08-05T17:19:24 <maozillah> michelled: ^
2015-08-05T17:20:00 <Bosmon> Justin_o - and into that mix we should add the further case of propagating a DELETE change request through a model - which currently is also treated specially - this is why that pull request that I referred to is stalled
2015-08-05T17:20:34 <michelled> it's ok maozillah - Justin_o represents your work :)
2015-08-05T17:20:36 <Justin_o> Bosmon: that would be really great to have as well
2015-08-05T17:20:54 <maozillah> michelled: coolio :)
2015-08-05T17:25:13 <gtirloni> fluid-everyone: we are experience some issues with our firewall upgrade and working to resolve it
2015-08-05T17:26:18 <gtirloni> it should be back now

2015-08-05T13:15:44 <Justin_o> anastasiac: i think it\'s related, but probably different than the specific issue we were discussing about the minified infusion.
2015-08-05T13:15:58 <Justin_o> I\'d probably suggest a new jira
2015-08-05T13:16:02 <Justin_o> but linked to this

2015-08-05T15:17:13 <Bosmon> Hi simonjb - thanks for your GPII-17 pull
2015-08-05T15:17:18 <Bosmon> Just checking it over now
2015-08-05T15:17:36 <simonjb> great! thanks Bosmon
2015-08-05T15:18:02 <Bosmon> simonjb - I\'m confused about what happened to mockjax
2015-08-05T15:18:13 <Bosmon> Can you remind me?
2015-08-05T15:18:31 <Bosmon> It looks like it got added to infusion\'s .npmignore?
2015-08-05T15:19:10 <Bosmon> well, some time ago.....
2015-08-05T15:20:26 <simonjb> Bosmon: I\'m still a little unsure exactly how we got into the situation but I removed mockjax when I moved the tests in March and referenced the one in infusion -- but as you say, it is in .npmignore
2015-08-05T15:20:46 <simonjb> I\'m thinking the most likely case was that I had a manual checkout of infusion
2015-08-05T15:20:55 <Bosmon> I\'m very puzzled that it appears in my infusion
2015-08-05T15:20:57 <simonjb> rather than set up by npm
2015-08-05T15:21:22 <simonjb> is your infusion from npm? or a clone made by yourself?
2015-08-05T15:21:29 <Bosmon> Well
2015-08-05T15:21:36 <Bosmon> I\'m starting to have an ominous feeling...
2015-08-05T15:22:31 <Bosmon> Well, I don\'t know
2015-08-05T15:22:39 <Bosmon> I started to think that this grunt task I had made was to blame
2015-08-05T15:22:45 <Bosmon> But this just executes npm install too
2015-08-05T15:23:12 <simonjb> here\'s the commit which removed it: https://github.com/simonbates/universal/commit/d4141b855e3de2b1943cfe1acc71633b549e0a5f
2015-08-05T15:24:10 <Bosmon> simonjb - ok.... I did a fresh npm install, and I still got mockjax.js included with my infusion
2015-08-05T15:24:18 <Bosmon> The plot thickens
2015-08-05T15:24:19 <simonjb> hmm
2015-08-05T15:24:28 <simonjb> now I\'m very confused
2015-08-05T15:24:44 <Bosmon> I am also very confused!
2015-08-05T15:24:49 <simonjb> an npm install in universal?
2015-08-05T15:24:53 <Bosmon> Yes
2015-08-05T15:24:57 <simonjb> hmm
2015-08-05T15:25:38 <Bosmon> In addition, this npm install includes absolutely everything else in infusion too
2015-08-05T15:26:06 <simonjb> like .npmignore is not being used?
2015-08-05T15:26:12 <Bosmon> Exactly like that, yes
2015-08-05T15:26:35 <simonjb> what version of npm?
2015-08-05T15:26:49 <simonjb> I\'m on 2.13.0
2015-08-05T15:27:16 <Bosmon> I\'m on 1.4.20
2015-08-05T15:27:20 <Bosmon> Released Jun 2, 2014
2015-08-05T15:27:32 <Bosmon> I guess it\'s not impossible that this is relevant : P
2015-08-05T15:29:55 <Bosmon> I guess I\'ll try updating to 2.13.0
2015-08-05T15:30:05 <Bosmon> Even though npm updates in general make me extremely afraid
2015-08-05T15:30:34 <simonjb> I\'ve been web searching to see if I can find out when .npmignore was added but no luck so far
2015-08-05T15:30:53 * yzen_ joined the channel
2015-08-05T15:30:57 <Bosmon> Well there have been countless dozens of updates to the git support within npm in this last year
2015-08-05T15:31:22 <Bosmon> I wouldn\'t be surprised if it wasn\'t some long-standing bug that afflicted the use of git-based dependencies...
2015-08-05T15:32:18 * avtar joined the channel
2015-08-05T15:33:30 <simonjb> Bosmon: https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/6400 -- related maybe
2015-08-05T15:34:20 <anastasiac> fluid-everyone: we\xe2\x80\x99ll be meeting in the fluid-standup room today
2015-08-05T15:35:12 <simonjb> Bosmon: yes, maybe a bug in npm and maybe I was also using a version of npm affected at the time I made this change
2015-08-05T15:35:29 <simonjb> of just a version that didn\'t support .npmignore
2015-08-05T15:35:49 * slim_ joined the channel

2015-08-05T17:10:12 <Justin_o> Bosmon: I\'m trying to use the stringToNumber transformation. It generally works but it\'s returning 0 for empty string
2015-08-05T17:10:22 <Justin_o> i\'d really want the model to be null in this case and not 0
2015-08-05T17:10:35 <Justin_o> is there a way to change this, or will i have to write a new transformation to handle it
2015-08-05T17:10:37 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes - it would be better to write a fresh transform
2015-08-05T17:10:44 <Justin_o> Bosmon: okay
2015-08-05T17:11:05 * kasparnet has quit
2015-08-05T17:11:09 <Justin_o> Bosmon: and is it generally preferred to write a new transformation over user a free transform
2015-08-05T17:13:14 <michelled> anastasiac, cindyli, Justin_o, maozillah, murilocrivellari, sepidehshahi: can we have a quick meeting?
2015-08-05T17:13:27 <Justin_o> michelled: okay
2015-08-05T17:13:35 <murilocrivellari> michelled: sure
2015-08-05T17:13:38 <Bosmon> Justin_o - well, actually, it looks like you wouldn\'t disturb any of the test cases of the existing stringToNumber
2015-08-05T17:13:41 <sepidehshahi> sure
2015-08-05T17:14:33 <maozillah> sure
2015-08-05T17:14:37 <Bosmon> So you could change the current behaviour and add a further test case - although it seems that there\'s an interesting difference in the approaches that might make it cleaner to write a separate transform for now
2015-08-05T17:14:38 <Justin_o> Bosmon: are you thinking i should update stringToNumber directly?
2015-08-05T17:14:42 <Justin_o> in infusion
2015-08-05T17:15:08 <maozillah> michelled: where?
2015-08-05T17:15:12 <Bosmon> This might be a general facility that we have to add into MT as a whole
2015-08-05T17:15:16 <sepidehshahi> michelled: which room do you want to meet?
2015-08-05T17:15:49 <Justin_o> Bosmon: not sure i\'m following?
2015-08-05T17:16:07 <Justin_o> are you meaning the ability to specify a "default" output of sorts?
2015-08-05T17:16:13 <Bosmon> Justin_o - yes, exactly that
2015-08-05T17:16:24 <Bosmon> we currently do this in a kind of haphazard way across the transforms
2015-08-05T17:16:35 <Bosmon> For example, the valueMapper has various confusing ways of supplying defaults
2015-08-05T17:17:08 * anastasiac has quit
2015-08-05T17:17:14 <Bosmon> Whereas it might make more sense if an input value which is not part of the proper domain of a transform could always be mapped to a special output value, rather than always mapping to "undefined" as it does/should now
2015-08-05T17:17:23 <Bosmon> But yes, for now cleanest if you just write a fresh transform
2015-08-05T17:17:26 * yzen_ has quit
2015-08-05T17:17:32 <Bosmon> And once we have all the examples we can generalise from them later
2015-08-05T17:17:47 <Bosmon> There needs to be a very big update to MT before long to bring all these issues into line
2015-08-05T17:17:57 <Bosmon> Including handling of NaN as well as undefined
2015-08-05T17:18:01 <michelled> anastasiac, cindyli, Justin_o, maozillah, murilocrivellari, sepidehshahi: actually, it looks like there isn\'t time in between the other meetings today. Let\'s just leave it until Monday.
