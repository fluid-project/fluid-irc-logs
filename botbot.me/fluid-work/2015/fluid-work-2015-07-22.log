2015-07-22T17:07:31 <colinclark> sure, whose room?
2015-07-22T17:08:23 <michelled> mine?
2015-07-22T17:08:33 <simonjb> sounds good
2015-07-22T17:08:44 <colinclark> be there in a sec!
2015-07-22T17:09:49 * danayo has quit
2015-07-22T17:15:27 * danayo joined the channel
2015-07-22T17:18:23 <Justin_o> colinclark: sorry, do you still have a question
2015-07-22T17:18:28 <colinclark> Justin_o: I do, yes
2015-07-22T17:18:30 <colinclark> no worries
2015-07-22T17:18:38 <colinclark> So here\'s the situation I have
2015-07-22T17:18:52 <colinclark> I have been hacking away on a repository in the "one lone developer" style
2015-07-22T17:19:15 <colinclark> https://github.com/colinbdclark/bergson/commits/master
2015-07-22T17:19:53 <colinclark> And then I got to a point where it was close to being "done," and thought it would be great to get some code review from our own Doctor Bosmon.
2015-07-22T17:19:55 <colinclark> https://github.com/colinbdclark/bergson/issues/1
2015-07-22T17:20:16 <colinclark> And he rightly pointed out that, in absence of the pull request UI, code review can be very difficult
2015-07-22T17:21:02 <colinclark> so now I\'m trying think of a way to provide a view for Bosmon that is a bit easier to review
2015-07-22T17:21:06 <colinclark> any thoughts on how that could be done?
2015-07-22T17:21:54 <Justin_o> colinclark: you want him to review the entire project or some subset of commits?
2015-07-22T17:22:07 <colinclark> the entire repository, yes
2015-07-22T17:22:58 <colinclark> I was imagining maybe I could branch off the first commit or something
2015-07-22T17:23:09 <colinclark> but it turns out that there\'s a lot in that first commit already
2015-07-22T17:24:49 <gtirloni> what if create a temporary bergson-review repo and submit a PR there against the empty repo?
2015-07-22T17:25:02 <Justin_o> colinclark: here\'s a comparison view, but you can\'t really comment on it, and if there was a lot in the first commit, then it\'s probably not all that you want https://github.com/colinbdclark/bergson/compare/a8327a7ec8b885d80b66d665a7ea07122bfabeb3...master
2015-07-22T17:25:43 <colinclark> gtirloni: I think that might be the only option
2015-07-22T17:25:55 <Justin_o> colinclark, gtirloni: another option i guess would be to create a new branch or repo and squash all the commits down into a single one
2015-07-22T17:25:57 * danayo has quit
2015-07-22T17:26:02 <colinclark> Justin_o: ah, interesting
2015-07-22T17:26:54 <Justin_o> colinclark: but that still might be an issue for that initial commit, so you might have to get Bosmon to review those separately...
2015-07-22T17:26:56 * slim_ has quit
2015-07-22T17:28:44 <colinclark> I guess this is really proof that you have to think of community-based development from the very start
2015-07-22T17:29:40 <colinclark> I\'ve been thinking about, and mentioned in the past, rethinking the "Fluid Studios" brand as an incubator for creative and cultural tools
2015-07-22T17:29:58 <colinclark> so maybe the thing to do is make a new repository there and do a PR, along the lines of gtirloni\'s suggestion
2015-07-22T17:30:01 <Justin_o> colinclark: these days i start with a github initialized repo, which gives a fairly empty repo save for maybe an empty README and license.. but i mostly do this so i can just do a checkout
2015-07-22T17:30:33 <Justin_o> colinclark: sure, you might have an issue because they don\'t have common history
2015-07-22T17:30:41 <Justin_o> but there\'s probably a way to force that

2015-07-22T17:50:30 <sepideh> Jess_: here is the first draft of the chart. Please let me know if it needs any changes https://www.dropbox.com/s/r5p6v1nbe3k1z9p/D103.1%20delivery%20timeline.png?dl=0
2015-07-22T17:50:51 <Jess_> sepideh: looking at it now :)
2015-07-22T17:51:01 <sepideh> great. thanks
2015-07-22T17:51:51 * danayo joined the channel
2015-07-22T17:52:07 <Jess_> sepideh: first thought: i wonder if we need to split out the three models to match the two deliverables now that we know we have to treat them as two?
2015-07-22T17:52:19 <Jess_> 102.2 = economic and 103.1 = infrastructure and user
2015-07-22T17:52:52 <sepideh> good point
2015-07-22T17:55:03 <Jess_> and for user model/exploring let\xe2\x80\x99s reference the 101.2 work
2015-07-22T17:55:10 <Jess_> reviewers seem to like that stuff :)
2015-07-22T17:55:17 <sepideh> great
2015-07-22T17:55:54 <Jess_> did i get that number right?
2015-07-22T17:57:41 <Jess_> it thought i put a reference into it last night but now can\xe2\x80\x99t find it
2015-07-22T17:57:57 <Jess_> ah, just did
2015-07-22T17:58:25 <Jess_> Yes, D101.2 is the number and i put it into the 3.1 section if you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for it
2015-07-22T17:59:10 <Jess_> sepideh: this looks great!
2015-07-22T18:00:08 <sepideh> Awesome. I\xe2\x80\x99ll make the changes and send a revised version. It\xe2\x80\x99s going to be tricky to split the 103 and 102 but I\xe2\x80\x99ll try.
2015-07-22T18:05:51 <Jess_> if it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come easily, i think you can leave it
2015-07-22T18:06:07 <danayo> sepideh, Jess_: i love the overview diagram
2015-07-22T18:06:24 <danayo> i.e. the visual TOC
2015-07-22T18:06:47 <sepideh> great, thx
2015-07-22T18:09:13 <danayo> sepideh can I suggest to reword the first question in the visual TOC to: "How does what I\'m building fit into the larger project?"
2015-07-22T18:09:32 <sepideh> for sure
2015-07-22T18:11:13 <sepideh> fixed.

2015-07-22T19:21:43 <Bosmon> Hi there colinclark
2015-07-22T19:22:18 <colinclark> Bosmon: hey
2015-07-22T19:22:22 <Bosmon> hey!
2015-07-22T19:22:45 <colinclark> Are there any examples that you know of where someone has written jqUnit tests that run, unaltered, both in a web browser and using node-jqUnit?
2015-07-22T19:23:16 <Bosmon> colinclark - none
2015-07-22T19:23:22 * alanharnum has quit
2015-07-22T19:23:45 <colinclark> Bosmon: It should be doable, right? With a bit of guarding around require()
2015-07-22T19:23:57 <colinclark> var fluid = fluid || require("infusion")
2015-07-22T19:24:04 <colinclark> and similar for jqUnit
2015-07-22T19:24:11 <Bosmon> colinclark - that seems reasonable, yes
2015-07-22T19:24:11 <colinclark> is that right?
2015-07-22T19:24:28 <Bosmon> It is right that it should be doable, yes :)
2015-07-22T19:24:35 <Bosmon> By means such as those :)
2015-07-22T19:24:35 <colinclark> :)
2015-07-22T19:24:55 <colinclark> And what do people do for setting up an "all tests" runner in node-jqUnit?
2015-07-22T19:25:37 <Bosmon> Currently not a lot, other than arranging to execute fixtures one after another
2015-07-22T19:25:49 <Bosmon> I fixed up the IoC testing framework a while back so that it at least responds to this approach
2015-07-22T19:26:16 <Bosmon> Here\'s our "all-tests" driver in GPII universal:
2015-07-22T19:26:16 <Bosmon> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/tests/all-tests.js
2015-07-22T19:26:54 <colinclark> that makes sense

2015-07-22T09:04:33 <slim_> hi guys
2015-07-22T09:04:51 <slim_> how should I get access to the latest and greatest PMT?
2015-07-22T09:09:10 <jhernandez> slim_: hey
2015-07-22T09:09:15 <jhernandez> do you mean https://github.com/GPII/prefsEditors?
2015-07-22T09:09:19 <slim_> yay!
2015-07-22T09:09:49 <slim_> Could be. Gregg talks about PMT - which was the old term I think.
2015-07-22T09:09:59 <slim_> I mean the tool people you to select preferences
2015-07-22T09:10:09 <slim_> not sure if it\'s online, or what
2015-07-22T09:10:49 <slim_> jhernandez: ^
2015-07-22T09:10:56 <slim_> that looks good thanks. Will try it
2015-07-22T09:11:20 <slim_> jhernandez: also Gregg mentioned the March release of GPII APfP
2015-07-22T09:11:21 <jhernandez> cool
2015-07-22T09:11:22 <jhernandez> yw
2015-07-22T09:11:37 <slim_> where is that? I still see no releases in GitHub. what is the release process these days?
2015-07-22T09:11:49 <jhernandez> no, we haven\'t released yet
2015-07-22T09:12:05 <jhernandez> so I guess he\'s talking about the LGS release or something
2015-07-22T09:12:09 <slim_> so what does Gregg mean? Is there a tag I meased?
2015-07-22T09:12:12 <slim_> *missed
2015-07-22T09:12:21 <jhernandez> I don\'t think so
2015-07-22T09:12:38 <slim_> yeah - prolly. I didn;t know about that either - obviously been too removed :)
2015-07-22T09:12:53 <slim_> I\'ll ask Gregg / hens
2015-07-22T09:13:55 <jhernandez> yup
2015-07-22T09:14:04 <jhernandez> that\'ll be the best
2015-07-22T09:14:05 <jhernandez> :)
2015-07-22T09:14:39 <slim_> cheers
2015-07-22T09:14:47 <slim_> jhernandez: how are things with you?
2015-07-22T09:14:58 <jhernandez> slim_: heh
2015-07-22T09:15:02 <jhernandez> things are going fine
2015-07-22T09:15:07 <jhernandez> :)
2015-07-22T09:15:41 <jhernandez> right now I\'m focused on closing cloud4all
2015-07-22T09:17:23 <jhernandez> once cloud4all is finished, I guess we\'ll start implementing more things
2015-07-22T09:17:58 <jhernandez> there are plenty of work that needs to be done
2015-07-22T09:18:27 <jhernandez> slim_: ^
2015-07-22T09:18:29 <jhernandez> :)
2015-07-22T09:23:08 <slim_> jhernandez: Great - do you have much left for C4A? I\'ve pretty much done it- certanily had all my cash
2015-07-22T09:23:19 <slim_> always too much to be done
2015-07-22T09:27:26 <jhernandez> well, we\'re supposed to have a few more things before the project ends
2015-07-22T09:28:01 <jhernandez> and of course, we need to pass the 4th review
2015-07-22T09:28:23 <jhernandez> a still there are a few things that needs to be done
2015-07-22T09:28:35 <jhernandez> *and
2015-07-22T09:30:19 <jhernandez> in my case, I\'m still working on the browser communication, android, linux packaging, providing support to other partners, etc
2015-07-22T09:31:02 <jhernandez> slim_: ^
2015-07-22T09:31:29 <slim_> jhernandez: so still everything! :)
2015-07-22T09:31:38 <jhernandez> yeah, more or less
2015-07-22T09:31:39 <jhernandez> xDDDDD
2015-07-22T09:31:47 <slim_> will be interested in browser comms some time
2015-07-22T09:32:00 <slim_> good man!
2015-07-22T09:32:01 <jhernandez> well, the initial support has just landed
2015-07-22T09:33:28 <jhernandez> (master)
2015-07-22T09:34:50 <jhernandez> but, for windows, we still need to get one more pull request in before you to try the browser-gpii integration
2015-07-22T09:35:21 <jhernandez> https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/312
2015-07-22T09:35:40 <slim_> tah
2015-07-22T09:35:41 <jhernandez> also, Guti has the firefox extension almost ready to go
2015-07-22T09:35:51 <slim_> Nice!
2015-07-22T09:36:02 <slim_> and what about Edge :-P
2015-07-22T09:36:29 <jhernandez> heh
2015-07-22T09:36:40 <jhernandez> slim_: what do you mean with "Edge"?
2015-07-22T09:37:20 <slim_> The new Microsoft Browser that will be the default in Windows 10. Was only joking
2015-07-22T09:37:42 <slim_> Edge is actuall standard compliant and ditches all the IE backwards crap
2015-07-22T09:37:56 <slim_> Was previousl know as project Spartan
2015-07-22T09:38:18 <slim_> https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/microsoft-edge
2015-07-22T09:44:57 <jhernandez> well, in case that we can create an extension like we\'ve done for chrome or firefox, we are ready to go
2015-07-22T09:45:00 <jhernandez> :)
2015-07-22T09:46:36 <jhernandez> slim_: from the link you posted
2015-07-22T09:46:39 <jhernandez> "The most important of those incoming features is extension support, which may also be how Microsoft addresses the question of Tracking Protection Lists and ad blocking \xe2\x80\x93 and it won\'t be in Edge at RTM."
2015-07-22T09:47:18 <jhernandez> so, let\'s see what happens in autumn
2015-07-22T09:47:20 <jhernandez> :)
2015-07-22T09:47:21 <slim_> aaahhhh
2015-07-22T09:47:36 <slim_> at least it WILL NOT be ActiveX!!!
2015-07-22T09:47:49 <slim_> but more standard
2015-07-22T09:48:41 <jhernandez> they need to go in that direction if they want to succeed
2015-07-22T09:49:24 <jhernandez> :)
2015-07-22T09:50:50 <slim_> yep and they seem to have finally realised it too
2015-07-22T09:55:21 <jhernandez> yeah, I think they\'re looking for their karma in "privative vs open"
