2015-09-24T15:55:59 <Justin_o> cindyli: have you heard of this before http://sinonjs.org
2015-09-24T15:56:09 <Justin_o> i'm wondering if we should use it for our tests instead of using mockjax
2015-09-24T15:57:15 <cindyli> no, looks pretty cool
2015-09-24T15:57:38 <Justin_o> it seems to be quite powerful, you can stub out functions to see if they get called and even with what parameters.
2015-09-24T15:58:53 <cindyli> worth a try
2015-09-24T16:03:02 <cindyli> anastasiac, Justin_o, simonjb: need a name for the new demo that I'm creating for the first discovery and the prefs server integration.
2015-09-24T16:03:18 <cindyli> prefsServerIntegration?
2015-09-24T16:04:04 <anastasiac> cindyli: will this demo live in the FD tool repo? it\xe2\x80\x99s own repo?
2015-09-24T16:04:12 <cindyli> oh, it's basically the name of the new folder that will sit in the demos folder
2015-09-24T16:04:13 <anastasiac> s/it\xe2\x80\x99s/its/
2015-09-24T16:04:24 <cindyli> anastasiac: in the fd tool repo
2015-09-24T16:04:26 <anastasiac> then prefsServerIntegration looks goot to me
2015-09-24T16:04:34 <anastasiac> s/goot/good/
2015-09-24T16:04:38 * anastasiac can\xe2\x80\x99t type today
2015-09-24T16:05:11 <cindyli> :)
2015-09-24T16:05:50 <cindyli> cool. will use that name

2015-09-24T18:52:00 <Justin_o> cindyli: now that FLOE-420 looks like it's working, do you think i should pull in the base repo into the fluid-project space
2015-09-24T18:52:13 <Justin_o> then i can send a pull request for FLOE-420 there soon
2015-09-24T18:52:50 <cindyli> Justin_o: no objection :)

2015-09-24T19:03:06 <Justin_o> alanharnum: thanks
2015-09-24T19:03:23 <alanharnum> whenever one of you (probably not both of you) has a chance to review that would be excellent
2015-09-24T19:12:17 <jhung> Justin_o, anastasiac, cindyli - do any of you have time to help test the ILDH tomorrow morning?
2015-09-24T19:12:36 <jhung> It should take long - I'm thinking 30 minutes max.
2015-09-24T19:12:36 <anastasiac> jhung, sure, I can space a little bit
