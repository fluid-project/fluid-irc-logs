2015-08-10T13:26:02 <simonjb> kasparnet: I was late getting online also; we haven\'t had a lot of attendance at the security meetings lately and I\'m thinking it maybe makes sense to put them on hold and instead just address security issues at the arch meeting

2015-08-10T13:32:00 <kasparnet> yeah - that makes sense
2015-08-10T13:32:13 <kasparnet> should I change the title on calendar to include something like "on hold"?
2015-08-10T13:35:55 <michelled> kasparnet: maybe just take it off the calendar
2015-08-10T13:36:07 <michelled> when we restart it, we might want to pick a different day and time
2015-08-10T13:36:19 <michelled> since it was difficult for some folks to make it at that time
2015-08-10T13:40:09 <kasparnet> cool - will do, michelled

2015-08-10T16:53:56 <Justin_o> anastasiac: what\'s your time looking like? Would you have time to look at writing the Tutorials for the First Discovery Tool?
2015-08-10T16:54:33 <anastasiac> Justin_o: do you mean \xe2\x80\x9cwill I have time to write them\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cwill I have time to look at what you\xe2\x80\x99ve written\xe2\x80\x9d?
2015-08-10T16:55:05 <Justin_o> anastasiac: the former, and if no time, the latter
2015-08-10T16:56:31 <anastasiac> Justin_o: I suspect that michelled might think your chart authoring coding work is higher priority than writing FD Tool tutorials. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t I give it a stab, and if necessary, ping you for help?
2015-08-10T16:56:43 <anastasiac> unless michelled contradicts me :-)
2015-08-10T16:57:28 <michelled> sounds good anastasiac - seeing as we\'d be putting your writing skills to good use :)
2015-08-10T16:57:42 <anastasiac> yep
2015-08-10T16:57:44 <Justin_o> anastasiac: you can get the code from my branch https://github.com/jobara/first-discovery/commits/car-demo
2015-08-10T16:57:52 <anastasiac> thanks, Justin_o
2015-08-10T16:58:09 <Justin_o> i think those 4 commits have the various things we\'d want to cover, based on the PGA meeting material we worked on
2015-08-10T16:58:16 <Justin_o> anastasiac: and thanks for the help

2015-08-10T17:03:17 <sepideh> danayo this is an interesting project by IDEO, similar to what you were doing for the voting context for PGA. and its UI is modeled after anywhere ballot: http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/06/los-angeles-county-moves-to-open-source-voting-technology/
2015-08-10T17:03:49 <sepideh> and it\xe2\x80\x99s amazing how they have opened up their research process to public: http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/06/los-angeles-county-moves-to-open-source-voting-technology/

2015-08-10T17:51:18 <Justin_o> anastasiac: do you have any suggestions on where in the wiki we should put the Component API docs for the First Discovery Tool?
2015-08-10T17:52:12 <anastasiac> looking, Justin_o
2015-08-10T17:53:38 <anastasiac> Justin_o: my connection is slow, so while I wait: Somewhere under the Preferences for Global Access page makes sense to me; perhaps as a direct child page? It\xe2\x80\x99s easy to move things in the wiki, so that seems like a good place to start

2015-08-10T18:33:49 <Justin_o> michelled, anastasiac, cindyli: How in depth do you think we need to go for the FD component API docs. should we have a doc for every grade/component? There seems to be about 37 grade definitions (i.e. calls to fluid.defaults) in the first discovery tool
2015-08-10T18:34:47 <anastasiac> Justin_o: I\xe2\x80\x99d suggest just start with the \xe2\x80\x9cmain\xe2\x80\x9d ones that someone continuing with the work or extending it will likely need to work with, and see how long that takes
2015-08-10T18:35:02 <michelled> such a good question Justin_o. I think this is a generally interesting question about our docs for everything
2015-08-10T18:35:08 <michelled> what have we done with Infusion proper?
2015-08-10T18:37:47 <Justin_o> michelled: hmm.. that\'s a good question too.. i\'m not sure all our components are broken down the way we might do today, were we to write them over.
2015-08-10T18:38:02 <Justin_o> i guess uploader would be the closest thing too look at https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/docs/Uploader+API
2015-08-10T18:38:16 <Justin_o> it seems to just mention the subcomponents
2015-08-10T18:39:13 <Justin_o> if we look at the preferences framework docs we don\'t seem to specifically talk about any of the panels or enactors https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/docs/Preferences+Framework
2015-08-10T18:39:25 <Justin_o> but that may just be because we haven\'t written anything for them yet

2015-08-10T19:02:06 <Justin_o> Bosmon2: looks like the latest version of your FLUID-5249 pull request is testing well https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Testing+Tasks
2015-08-10T19:03:15 <Justin_o> Bosmon2: i\'m wondering when we should merge it in though. Kaye has some outstanding pull requests that I think will probably require some significant changes to merge with this branches changes. https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pulls/maozillah
2015-08-10T19:03:55 <Justin_o> Bosmon2: FLUID-5678 is just about ready to go in, very minor change. FLUID-5700 and FLUID-5682 are probably close too..
2015-08-10T19:04:27 <Justin_o> Bosmon2: so the question would be should these go in first, or after. and if it is after, would you be available to help make the necessary changes for them to merge properly?
