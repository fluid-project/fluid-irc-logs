b"2015-01-27T18:35:01 <Bosmon> My kitchen shows how this works.....
2015-01-27T18:37:37 <cindyli> ur kitchen seems to need the same strategy
2015-01-27T18:37:47 <Bosmon> If only it could be PERMANENTLY REFACTORED
2015-01-27T18:37:51 <Bosmon> Unfortunately it is made of matter
2015-01-27T18:39:48 <Bosmon> I can hardly believe that we are rid of UIOPTIONS MODEL RELAY
2015-01-27T18:40:03 <Bosmon> It's like an impossible dream : P

2015-01-27T19:24:36 <danaayotte> anastasiac I started this page to capture some open questions for the first discovery tool, let me know if it's not making sense, I'll keep adding to it, it's helping me think through what's needed for the testing protocol as well

2015-01-27T14:18:47 <michelled> colinclark, Bosmon: kasparnet and I are just going through pull requests and we had a quick question.
2015-01-27T14:19:11 <michelled> had we decided in the GPII community that changes such as updating the version of Kettle could be pushed by the person who made the change?
2015-01-27T14:19:23 <kasparnet> (eg https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/292/files)
2015-01-27T14:20:12 <kasparnet> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KzZYjqKGP6xwp0YQxyTfswIibICVNBEmUys36kKB8qs/edit
2015-01-27T14:24:37 <colinclark> I can't really remember
2015-01-27T14:24:46 <colinclark> but I'm okay with such a policy
2015-01-27T14:25:03 <colinclark> preferably with a clear definition

2015-01-27T15:11:23 <Justin_o> cindyli: i'm thinking gpii

2015-01-27T15:14:50 <cindyli> Bosmon: I wonder if you take a look on my pull request for FLUID-5552 - https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/582? It upgrades the prefs framework to use the framework built-in model relay.
2015-01-27T15:19:57 <the-t-in-rtf> @simonjb: I would like to pull you in to work together on a shared express module.  You should see a JIRA ticket and something from Steve.  Comment there if you're too overloaded.
2015-01-27T15:20:24 <cindyli> thanks, Justin_o. i will start with gpii namespace. it can be switched if we decide on another one.
2015-01-27T15:28:13 <anastasiac> jhung, I made some comments on your fluidproject site pull request
2015-01-27T15:28:43 <Bosmon> cindyli - yes, I will look at it
2015-01-27T15:28:50 <Bosmon> In the meantime, could you test out my fix to your relay issue?
2015-01-27T15:29:01 <Bosmon> Hopefully it enables your FLUID-5552 branch to actually work now
2015-01-27T15:29:11 <cindyli> thanks, Bosmon. i've tested, it works perfectly, has left a comment in ur pull request
2015-01-27T15:29:16 <Bosmon> oh great
2015-01-27T15:29:51 <Bosmon> Sorry, somehow there were 40 or so pull request comments from the GPII this morning, I missed yours, sorry : P
2015-01-27T15:29:53 <cindyli> that's how i can issue a pull request for FLUID-5552. It's dependent on ur pull for FLUID-5592, Bosmon
2015-01-27T15:30:09 * rk29 has quit
2015-01-27T15:30:15 <cindyli> not a problem. glad you got this sorted out. thanks, Bosmon
2015-01-27T15:30:19 <Bosmon> ok, cool
2015-01-27T15:30:27 <Bosmon> Would you like to review my FLUID-5592 pull in the meantime?
2015-01-27T15:31:07 <cindyli> i can do it, Bosmon
2015-01-27T15:32:17 <michelled> anastasiac, cindyli, jhung, Justin_o: are you available to meet at 11:00?
2015-01-27T15:32:29 <cindyli> yes, michelled

2015-01-27T15:50:05 <michelled> slim_jim: can they not sign up? http://issues.gpii.net/secure/Signup!default.jspa
2015-01-27T15:51:54 <slim_jim> michelled: hmm  - looks like he overlooked that adn I don;t see it as logged in - thanks
2015-01-27T15:52:44 <michelled> slim_jim: after signing up, they will need someone with admin privileges to change the group they belong to.
2015-01-27T15:55:23 <slim_jim> michelled:  OK. I can't see a list of groups but I guess     jira-developers & jira-users will do?
2015-01-27T15:55:47 <michelled> I think jira-developers is fine
2015-01-27T15:56:49 <colinclark_> sgithens______: Can you send Tony a link to your Solutions Registry prototoype whenever you get a sec?

2015-01-27T18:30:52 <Bosmon> cindyli, this work on upgrading UIOptions is really, really excellent
2015-01-27T18:31:00 <Bosmon> I mean it!
2015-01-27T18:31:10 <cindyli> YAY!! thanks, Bosmon
2015-01-27T18:31:17 <Bosmon> I am not just saying it is excellent : P
2015-01-27T18:31:29 <cindyli> haha
2015-01-27T18:31:53 <Bosmon> I was just saying to colinclark what marvellous red patches there are
2015-01-27T18:31:58 <Bosmon> And how the green patches mostly consist of configuration
2015-01-27T18:32:11 <Bosmon> It looks like we've managed to shed quite a bit of code during this rewrite
2015-01-27T18:32:28 <Bosmon> Which is the kind of thing that every team should aspire to, and few teams actually achieve
2015-01-27T18:32:51 <Bosmon> Since so few of them stay working with the same codebase and try to constantly improve it as we do
2015-01-27T18:33:06 <cindyli> +100
2015-01-27T18:33:29 <Bosmon> We should try to make an assessment of how much shorter the prefs framework is once this goes in
2015-01-27T18:33:47 <Bosmon> I'm also excited to, directly as a result of this, be able to remove the corresponding code from the ChangeApplier
2015-01-27T18:34:03 <Bosmon> Which will also let us shed a couple of hundred lines from a very sensitive area
2015-01-27T18:34:39 <Bosmon> Not to rant further, but this is why projects end up managing codebases that are in the hundreds of thousands, or millions of lines of code
2015-01-27T18:34:50 <Bosmon> If you never bother to clear up the mess after you, the mess just builds on further mess
