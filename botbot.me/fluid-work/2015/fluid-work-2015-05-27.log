2015-05-27T13:00:31 <jhung> Justin_o: can you remind me what you wanted tested on Android? Do you still need this?
2015-05-27T13:00:48 <Justin_o> jhung: yes, still need it.
2015-05-27T13:01:12 <Justin_o> jhung: could you please test what happens to a video played from a browser... does it always go to full screen mode.
2015-05-27T13:01:29 <Justin_o> i can\'t remember if there was something else
2015-05-27T13:01:34 <Justin_o> specific to android
2015-05-27T13:01:40 <Justin_o> oh
2015-05-27T13:01:43 <Justin_o> i remember
2015-05-27T13:01:54 <Justin_o> can you try out the self voicing of the First Discovery Tool
2015-05-27T13:02:03 <Justin_o> jhung: ^
2015-05-27T13:02:31 <jhung> ok Justin_o.
2015-05-27T13:02:59 <Justin_o> jhung: thanks
2015-05-27T13:03:11 <jhung> np

2015-05-27T13:13:10 <jhung> Justin_o: I tested with FF and Chrome on Android 5.1.1 + Nexus 7. HTML video does not go full screen by default. We should probably test with a Nexus 4-6 to verify.
2015-05-27T13:13:26 <Justin_o> jhung: cool
2015-05-27T13:16:37 <jhung> voicing works well in Chrome on nexus 7 Justin_o.
2015-05-27T13:16:53 * anvk joined the channel
2015-05-27T13:17:52 <Justin_o> excellent
2015-05-27T13:18:03 <Justin_o> did you try another language too
2015-05-27T13:18:05 <Justin_o> jhung: ^
2015-05-27T13:22:10 <jhung> A few bugs Justin_o.
2015-05-27T13:23:27 <jhung> 1. It seems there are times the text on screen is not read back. it would only read back the current visible tooltip. This happens regardless of the language selected.
2015-05-27T13:24:02 <jhung> 2. The slider adjuster lays out improperly on the Nexus 7. The next and prev buttons lay out on different lines.
2015-05-27T13:24:32 <Justin_o> jhung: 1) might be the intended behaviour right now, but i\'d have to see it
2015-05-27T13:24:52 <jhung> It\'s weird because this is what happens\xe2\x80\xa6
2015-05-27T13:25:11 * Jess_ joined the channel
2015-05-27T13:25:14 <jhung> On language selection screen, the screen is read back properly.
2015-05-27T13:25:39 <jhung> But the next two screens, only the tooltip is read back "Select to go to next step" gets read only.
2015-05-27T13:26:04 <jhung> Then when you get to speech rate, it finally says: "This is step 4 of 11\xe2\x80\xa6"
2015-05-27T13:27:09 <Justin_o> :(
2015-05-27T13:29:29 <jhung> but other times, screen 3 gets read back. So it\'s not entirely consistent Justin_o.
2015-05-27T13:30:05 <Justin_o> jhung: you mean 3 screens at once?
2015-05-27T13:30:36 <jhung> Want me to show you on vidyo?

2015-05-27T15:22:06 <Justin_o> Bosmon: is there a way to add a modelListener for any model value except x
2015-05-27T15:22:25 <Bosmon> Justin_o - see cindyli\'s earlier question on exactly these lines :)
2015-05-27T15:22:33 <Bosmon> if you find yourself in this situation, you need to restructure your model
2015-05-27T15:22:52 <Justin_o> Bosmon: where was that question?
2015-05-27T15:22:56 <Bosmon> In here
2015-05-27T15:23:01 <Bosmon> I guess nearly 2 weeks ago
2015-05-27T15:23:02 <Justin_o> today?
2015-05-27T15:23:03 <cindyli> a few days ago
2015-05-27T15:23:07 <Justin_o> oh okay
2015-05-27T15:23:13 <Bosmon> It led to the restructuring of the prefs framework model into separate areas
2015-05-27T15:23:23 <Bosmon> One for "preferences" and the other for "ui state"
2015-05-27T15:23:34 <Justin_o> oh.. i think that was a week or two ago :)
2015-05-27T15:23:53 <Justin_o> but okay, thanks

2015-05-27T15:50:54 <cindyli> do you think if you could look into it?

2015-05-27T15:50:59 <jhung> ah yes. That\'s on my todo cindyli. I\'ll assign myself to that
2015-05-27T15:51:06 <cindyli> cool. thanks, jhung

2015-05-27T15:55:41 <anastasiac> cindyli, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to test it and merge
