2015-08-19T14:54:38 <clown> simonjb, I\'m thinking of upgrading my GPII development to a F22 VM (currently using F21).  Have you or avtar had any problems?
2015-08-19T14:57:22 <simonjb> clown: I\'ve not had any problems and all has been working smoothly. My notes from setting up the VM are here: https://gist.github.com/simonbates/df4a3723beba3143c7ba#file-gpii-on-virtualbox-fedora-22-md
2015-08-19T14:57:41 <clown> thanks simonjb.  I\'ll take the plunge.

2015-08-19T17:03:28 <Bosmon> Very useful posting on the CSS border-box model that I ran into last night - just dumping here for general reference: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16034397/css-calc-alternative
2015-08-19T17:06:20 <Bosmon> Thanks for the continued review on the docs branch, anastasiac - it is really helpful
2015-08-19T17:06:37 <anastasiac> hopefully not too annoying, Bosmon
2015-08-19T17:06:49 <Bosmon> It is lovely :)
2015-08-19T17:07:00 <Bosmon> Any attention on our docs is brilliant
2015-08-19T17:07:46 <anastasiac> Bosmon, thanks for all the extra improvements you\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing, in addition to just the necessary updates, it\xe2\x80\x99s great to see them
2015-08-19T17:08:24 <Bosmon> anastasiac - I believe I knocked on the head the last of the CSS issues last night - let me know what you think
2015-08-19T17:08:36 <Bosmon> The structure of the rules may not be very expert, but I think the visual impression is generally reasonable
2015-08-19T17:09:45 <anastasiac> I saw it, Bosmon, much better. The footer does start to disappear if the height of the window is reduced enough, but I suspect that for now, that might be ok. Maybe when jhung updates the docs-base/template repositories, he could investigate if there\xe2\x80\x99s anything to be done.
2015-08-19T17:10:29 <jhung> anastasiac, Bosmon: sure. Can you file a jira for it so we don\'t lose track of it anastasiac?
2015-08-19T17:10:52 <anastasiac> k
2015-08-19T17:11:03 <Bosmon> anastasiac - I don\'t see the footer disappearing even when the browser is extremely short
2015-08-19T17:11:10 <Bosmon> Which browser/platform are you using?
2015-08-19T17:11:35 <anastasiac> Bosmon, it only happens on a very short page, like the root page, where there\xe2\x80\x99s very little text
2015-08-19T17:11:43 <Bosmon> aha
2015-08-19T17:11:48 <anastasiac> :-)
2015-08-19T17:11:59 <anastasiac> again, probably not a problem
2015-08-19T17:12:03 <anastasiac> for now
2015-08-19T17:12:08 <Bosmon> Still
2015-08-19T17:12:21 <Bosmon> I was extremely proud of my understanding of the BORDER BOCKES calculation model : P
2015-08-19T17:12:24 <Bosmon> I will look into it
2015-08-19T17:12:59 <Bosmon> Oh yes... it\'s the min size I put on it
2015-08-19T17:13:11 <Bosmon> To address your issue from the previous time round of it floating up too high : P
2015-08-19T17:13:35 <Bosmon> Well, I\'ll think a bit more....
2015-08-19T17:14:22 <Bosmon> Well, even our current styling doesn\'t do great in this respect
2015-08-19T17:14:23 <Bosmon> http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/index-api.html
2015-08-19T17:14:38 <Bosmon> It\'s "cheating" slightly by putting the footer at the lower of the two out of the main content and the left TOC
2015-08-19T17:14:48 <Bosmon> So when both are quite short, it floats quite high

2015-08-19T18:26:29 <simonjb> anastasiac: do you know if we normally do the community workshops in the collab room or fluid standup on vidyo?
2015-08-19T18:27:02 <anastasiac> simonjb: in the past, it\xe2\x80\x99s been the collab room, but I think now that we\xe2\x80\x99ve got the new way to connect to stand-up, we should probably use that
2015-08-19T18:30:20 <simonjb> Bosmon2: we are connected to the vidyo collab room for the community meeting
2015-08-19T18:30:48 <simonjb> anastasiac: let\'s use the collab room for today and then figure out in the future
