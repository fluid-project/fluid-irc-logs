2018-04-19T15:38:47 <stegru> amatas[m]: in https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud/current/getting-started.html: "For the RESTful API, port 9243 is used for HTTPS connections and is strongly recommended (port 443 is also supported for HTTPS)"
2018-04-19T15:39:04 <stegru> I\'ve tested it on my computer and it works, do you tihnk we should give it to Han to try?
2018-04-19T15:40:28 <stegru> I mean, I tried port 443
