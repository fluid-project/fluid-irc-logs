2018-02-14T16:53:48 <cindyli> mrtyler: if running "rake" from my local changed gpii-infra directory, would the deployed cloud use my locally changed deployment files?
2018-02-14T16:54:10 <mrtyler> cindyli: in general, yes
2018-02-14T16:54:14 <cindyli> ok. thanks
2018-02-14T16:54:25 <mrtyler> there are situations where it\'s not quite that simple
2018-02-14T16:54:42 <mrtyler> but it\'s certainly the right place to start :)
2018-02-14T16:55:54 <cindyli> ok. running "rake" and i suddenly remembered i didn\'t "rake destroy" the previously deployed cloud. does it matter, mrtyler
2018-02-14T16:56:16 <cindyli> would the old one be overwritten?
2018-02-14T16:56:18 <mrtyler> again: in general, no. but there are situations where destroy/re-create will be simpler
2018-02-14T16:56:32 <cindyli> ok. terminating the run
2018-02-14T16:56:32 <mrtyler> in general, kubernetes will try to make the cluster look like the new configuration
2018-02-14T16:56:46 <mrtyler> stuff like env var changes, no problem
2018-02-14T16:57:04 <mrtyler> the dataloader Job is a special case i mentioned to you before. you\'ll have to destroy and re-create that Job to change it to use your docker image
2018-02-14T16:57:35 <cindyli> yes, have rebuilt and repushed the dataloader image
2018-02-14T16:57:47 <mrtyler> right but you\'ll have to delete the dataloader Job in kubernetes
2018-02-14T16:57:53 <cindyli> ok, i see
2018-02-14T16:58:02 <mrtyler> via the dashboard, e.g.
2018-02-14T16:58:24 <cindyli> oh, not via "rake destroy"?
2018-02-14T16:58:34 <mrtyler> also i think that for your changes, \'rake destroy\' should never be necessary. you can use \'rake undeploy\' followed by \'rake deploy\', which should be a bit quicker
2018-02-14T16:58:49 * michelled has quit
2018-02-14T16:58:50 <mrtyler> \'rake destroy\' will do the job, but also a lot more stuff
2018-02-14T16:59:11 <mrtyler> that said, \'rake destroy\' and \'rake\' will let you completely start over, which is valuable sometimes
2018-02-14T16:59:22 <mrtyler> just takes a little longer since it has more work to do
2018-02-14T17:00:38 <cindyli> ok, will keep that in mind.
2018-02-14T17:00:58 <cindyli> mrtyler: shall i still manually delete the data loader job from the dashboard after running \'rake undeploy\'?
2018-02-14T17:01:08 <mrtyler> no, rake undeploy will do that for you
2018-02-14T17:01:13 <cindyli> ok. thanks

2018-02-14T17:18:38 <josephmurray> Hi, I recently noticed that you are a Google Summer of Code project. I\'m wondering if there might be interest in collaborating. CiviCRM is an open source constituent relationship management project used by over 10,000 organizations around the world to manage donations, memberships, event registrations, etc. We\'re in GSoC for the 3rd or 4th time this year. We are interested in improving our WCAG compliance and
2018-02-14T17:18:39 <josephmurray> wonder if you might be interested in co-supervising? We don\'t have lots of technical expertise, but someone at the American National Institute for the Blind has helped us a bit with identifying and prioritizing the work, and could likely help with testing though her time is limited. See https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-20798, especially subissue https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-20826 which is
2018-02-14T17:18:39 <josephmurray> stalled because there is no easy upgrade path for the old widely used select2 widget to the accessible one developed by the WordPress community.

2018-02-14T17:24:43 <colinclark> josephmurray: Hi, welcome!
2018-02-14T17:24:50 <colinclark> That sounds like a really interesting idea
2018-02-14T17:25:10 <colinclark> and I\'m sure someone in our community would be interested in helping to co-mentor a student to work on one of your projects
2018-02-14T17:25:26 <josephmurray> cool
2018-02-14T17:26:46 * avtar joined the channel
2018-02-14T17:26:56 <colinclark> I\'m just on my way out the door shortly, but alanharnum might have some thoughts on specific issues you\'re facing. And otherwise perhaps an email to Justin_o, who helps to coordinate our GSoC activities, would be a good next step
2018-02-14T17:33:14 <alanharnum> hi josephmurray, that sounds quite interesting (I actually played around with CiviCRM years ago); it\'s good to hear you\'d like to improve the WCAG compliance!
2018-02-14T17:35:20 <josephmurray> I\'ve just added Improved Accessibility as another GSoC projec to our list, and mentioned fluid-tech https://lab.civicrm.org/community-team/gsoc2018/blob/master/projects.md
2018-02-14T17:35:46 <josephmurray> thanks @alanharnum and @colinclark
2018-02-14T17:36:12 <alanharnum> Justin_o (who coordinates GSoC) isn\'t in the channel currently and I believe is away for the next week, but if you want to send some details about what you\'re proposing to Justin_o, myself and cindyli (I\'ll PM you emails), we can chat further
2018-02-14T17:36:13 <josephmurray> btw, I\'m actually based in Toronto and I see fluid-tech has some relationship to OCAD
2018-02-14T17:36:43 <alanharnum> josephmurray: yup, a number of us are Toronto-based and our day job is at the Inclusive Design Research Centre at OCADU
2018-02-14T17:36:44 <josephmurray> very cool @alanharnum
2018-02-14T17:37:10 <josephmurray> I\'m based at the Centre for Social Innovation, but my two staff are in India
2018-02-14T17:37:45 <josephmurray> Do you know Gabe Sawhney
2018-02-14T17:38:04 <alanharnum> josephmurray: yup, I know Gave through civic tech groups in Toronto
2018-02-14T17:38:12 <alanharnum> s/Gave/Gabe
2018-02-14T17:38:14 <josephmurray> I think he has taught at OCADU, and used to have desk near me at CSI
2018-02-14T17:38:16 <josephmurray> cool
2018-02-14T17:38:29 <josephmurray> looking forward to the PM/email
2018-02-14T17:38:40 <josephmurray> joe dot murray at jmaconsulting dot biz
2018-02-14T17:40:13 <josephmurray> @alanharnum what would be a good next step? See if a student expresses interest and then work together with them to help shape a project?
2018-02-14T17:41:56 <alanharnum> josephmurray: I\'d say so, yeah; I\'m not sure if GSOC has any formal requirement for co-mentoring, but I think we\'d be happy to serve as a resource on WCAG and a11y implementation, and we can point them to other places that may be useful
2018-02-14T17:42:54 <josephmurray> And likewise, if you want to list this as a fluid-tech potential project, we could serve as a co-mentor
2018-02-14T17:50:46 <josephmurray> email sent. Thanks folks!
