2018-08-15T13:36:51 <alanharnum> Bosmon: have considered your comments and like the "Resolver" convention best for this specific case: https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/pull/41#discussion_r210265815
2018-08-15T13:37:12 <Bosmon> alanharnum - absolutely, just checking it all out now
2018-08-15T13:38:01 <Bosmon> Do you know how far we might be off managing to get kettle enrolled into buildKite?
2018-08-15T13:38:04 <Bosmon> Or perhaps it is already?
2018-08-15T13:38:18 <Bosmon> I see you have a KETTLE-66 buildKite branch
2018-08-15T13:38:33 <alanharnum> Bosmon: I\'m pretty sure it is already: https://buildkite.com/fluid-project/kettle
2018-08-15T13:38:51 <Bosmon> alanharnum - ok - can I do anything to get the badge or other feedback to appear in pulls?
2018-08-15T13:38:55 <Bosmon> Or does the integration not work that way
2018-08-15T13:43:07 <alanharnum> Bosmon: I\'m pretty sure I\'ve seen it working that way before but I\'m not sure how to configure it without some research - it\'s probably a configuration in Buildkite that requires authentication with the Github account of someone with admin over the repo
2018-08-15T13:43:17 <alanharnum> gtirloni may have insight ^
2018-08-15T13:49:07 <alanharnum> Bosmon: I can see this from Kettle settings page in Buildkite: "Buildkite has temporarily turned off commit status updates for this build pipeline. We kept getting 404\'s when trying to make API requests."
2018-08-15T13:49:21 <alanharnum> This can happen if you\'ve recently enabled third-party access restrictions, in which case you\'ll need to Grant or Request Access to Buildkite. You\'ll also need to make sure your GitHub user account is connected with GitHub, and has access to the repositories."
2018-08-15T13:49:29 <alanharnum> "Once you\xe2\x80\x99ve re-authorized or approved GitHub with Buildkite, simply re-enable the Update pull request commit statuses option below and we\xe2\x80\x99ll start posting commit status updates again."
2018-08-15T13:50:12 <Bosmon> alanharnum - yes, I had just got to the same point
2018-08-15T13:50:23 <Bosmon> Now I am trying to figure out how to actually grant access : P

2018-08-15T13:51:21 <Bosmon> Unfortunately the link on that page goes to Github\'s list of granted authorizations, rather than BuildKite\'s page for requesting authorisation....

2018-08-15T14:11:21 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - it looks like a back-version of grunt has sneaked into gpii-grunt-lint-all as a non-dev dependency
2018-08-15T14:11:22 <Bosmon> https://github.com/GPII/gpii-grunt-lint-all/blob/master/package.json#L37
2018-08-15T14:12:16 <Bosmon> Also I think we may as well start omitting the "engines" section of these since whatever we assert there is almost never based on any evidence
2018-08-15T14:12:49 <the-t-in-rtf> I suddenly and just got when v8 is called v8.
2018-08-15T14:12:53 <the-t-in-rtf> "v8 engine"
2018-08-15T14:12:55 <the-t-in-rtf> duh.
2018-08-15T14:13:03 <the-t-in-rtf> s/when/why/
2018-08-15T14:13:15 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, I\'ll put together a small micro-agression to fix it if there\'s not one open.
2018-08-15T14:13:51 <Bosmon> :)

2018-08-15T14:55:07 <the-t-in-rtf> yup, will do.
2018-08-15T15:19:43 <gtirloni> Bosmon alanharnum: I\'ve re-enabled the status updates. They may trigger in the next commit, I can\'t be sure. I think they may have been disabled when I was cleaning up some BK/GH configuration on my account, I\'ve created INFRA-207 ticket to report this issue
2018-08-15T15:20:03 <gtirloni> alanharnum: your builds should be working now, INFRA-206
2018-08-15T15:20:11 <Bosmon> gtirloni - cheers, was this something I could have done for myself?
2018-08-15T15:20:14 <Bosmon> What did it involve
2018-08-15T15:21:01 <gtirloni> Bosmon: it involved going here https://buildkite.com/user/connected-apps, disabling the GitHub integration and enabling it again. Then I went to the pipeline settings and re-enabled status updates checkbox
2018-08-15T15:21:33 <Bosmon> ok
