2018-07-03T16:05:25 <gtirloni> amatas[m]: hi alfredo! tony mentioned here that there are new commits for this PR (https://github.com/gpii-ops/vagrant-gpii-ci/pull/1) .. I was wondering if I can use your master branch (amatas/vagrant-gpii-ci-plugin) to run a few things here

2018-07-03T16:26:00 <amatas[m]> hi Gio, well, my master branch only has 1 commit :D
2018-07-03T16:26:20 <amatas[m]> but, all the commits are fine, I have to remove the last commit of the review branch
2018-07-03T16:26:53 <amatas[m]> it\'s the work in progress that is stopped
2018-07-03T16:27:21 <amatas[m]> let me fix that now, and merge the changes to the master of the gpii-ops repository
2018-07-03T16:31:23 <amatas[m]> gtirloni: https://github.com/gpii-ops/vagrant-gpii-ci/
2018-07-03T16:31:46 <amatas[m]> you can start with the master branch of the above repository
2018-07-03T16:32:14 <gtirloni> your master branch looks very clean, yes :) i should have said "nojira-review"
2018-07-03T16:32:21 <gtirloni> thanks! i\'ll test it and let you know if i have any comments :D
