2018-02-07T18:18:08 <colinclark> alanharnum: I wonder if you\'ve ever seen this little component, which has circulated in a somewhat ad-hoc manner? https://github.com/colinbdclark/flock-drum/blob/master/src/migrate/to-infusion/DynamicComponentIndexer.js
2018-02-07T18:18:17 <colinclark> It originally came from Bosmon\'s work on the Visible Nexus
2018-02-07T18:18:59 <colinclark> but it seems to possess some of the capabilities of your "Dynamic View Manager" component
2018-02-07T18:19:25 <colinclark> in particular, dealing with references to dynamic components based on their comings and goings
2018-02-07T18:19:32 <alanharnum> ahhh, i have not colinclark - yes, there\'s some similarities
2018-02-07T18:25:25 <alanharnum> much of what I wrote is related to managing the specifics of view components in relation to the DOM, but there\'s a similar "register / deregister" process where the manager maintains an index of the currently present managed view components, keyed by their guid-based class names as they\'re added and removed from the DOM: https://github.com/waharnum/sjrk-dynamic-view-component

2018-02-07T19:19:17 <Bosmon> alanharnum - I\'d proposed a little section on gizmos such as the DynamicComponentIndexer for this evening\'s session but I think simonjb considered that it represented too much technical detail for the expected audience
2018-02-07T19:19:34 <Bosmon> But this "pattern" has already appeared 4 or 5 times in subtly different forms around our codebase
2018-02-07T19:19:40 * clown joined the channel
2018-02-07T19:19:58 <Bosmon> Naturally the future framework will make such things go away, but we should try to curate them as well as possible
2018-02-07T19:20:07 * michelled joined the channel
2018-02-07T19:21:18 <alanharnum> Bosmon: yup, I\'m not sure how to best surface things like this for general usage - I think a patterns library would help but it would be better (IMO) to have them available as small npm modules, if not part of core Infusion
2018-02-07T19:22:28 <alanharnum> I like "gizmos" as the name / conceptually
2018-02-07T19:23:24 <Bosmon> Well, we should at least have some kind of index of all the number of times this gizmo has been replicated, and the reasons/thinking behind any subtle differences of design ...
