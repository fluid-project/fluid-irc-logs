2018-04-10T15:14:08 <Justin_o> i suppose we may want to consider it for master and the release branches at some point

2018-04-10T16:19:34 <gtirloni> Justin_o: thank you
2018-04-10T16:20:02 <Justin_o> gtirloni: I was looking into your PR for the squashing
2018-04-10T16:21:01 <Justin_o> according to the comment here the squash may not include the revert commit https://stackoverflow.com/a/5309051
2018-04-10T16:21:25 <Justin_o> i haven't tested yet to verify, but I thought I'd first ask you what you want for the history.
2018-04-10T16:21:41 <Justin_o> with squash you can potentially keep all the commit logs, even though there would be a single commit.
2018-04-10T16:22:07 <Justin_o> Alternatively, you could just do a git reset and effectively merge all your changes into a single commit that way, however, you won't keep your logs
2018-04-10T16:23:02 <gtirloni> i thought about the later but i wasn't sure about the times i merged master, if that would confuse github but i can try. i don't care about my logs in particular, just that infusion's doesn't get polluted
2018-04-10T16:24:05 <Justin_o> ah hmm.. that is a good question.. i guess you could do a reset, stash, and then update from master, then merge your stash
2018-04-10T16:24:23 <Justin_o> i wonder if that's more work though, i could experiment with squash first and see if the code ends up in the correct state
2018-04-10T16:24:50 <gtirloni> ok, if that won't be too much work i'd prefer the squash then

2018-04-10T17:27:59 <Justin_o> gtirloni_: so i tested out squashing. it seems to produce the correct final product. Here's an example commit log from my repo https://github.com/jobara/infusion/commit/2a48e84dcb76502b1a3c49cf52c0537a2c591f3d
2018-04-10T17:28:55 <Justin_o> so a couple of things, 1) is that it seems to retain all the history anyways, so maybe i should just merge it as per usual
2018-04-10T17:29:31 <Justin_o> 2) It doesn't look like a merge, although it does nicely identify it as a squash
2018-04-10T17:29:35 * gtirloni_ has quit
2018-04-10T17:29:50 <Justin_o> 3) part of me thinks it would be easier if all of our merges looked like this, but that's a different topic i guess
