2018-09-11T16:59:39 <clown> jhernandez:  do you have a minute (or two)?
2018-09-11T17:00:21 <jhernandez> clown: I was about to leave the computer
2018-09-11T17:00:25 <jhernandez> but have 5 mins for sure
2018-09-11T17:00:30 <clown> jhernandez:  okay, thanks
2018-09-11T17:00:32 <jhernandez> what's up?!
2018-09-11T17:00:49 <clown> cindyli1:  brought me up-to-date on the meeting that I missed earlier today.
2018-09-11T17:01:15 <clown> It seems there is a decision for the data loader to no longer load empty user prefs, going forward.  Is that right?
2018-09-11T17:01:32 <clown> If so, could you answer cindyli1 here, and make it official:  https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/626#discussion_r215038671
2018-09-11T17:03:38 * clown only two minutes left\xe2\x80\xa6
2018-09-11T17:04:29 <jhernandez> yes, I guess that this was the conclusion
2018-09-11T17:04:55 <clown> you don't sound certain.
2018-09-11T17:05:07 <jhernandez> although we should think about defining the process to insert empty users into the prefs server
2018-09-11T17:05:16 <jhernandez> heh
2018-09-11T17:05:40 <clown> is inserting empty prefs into the prefs server the job of the data loader?
2018-09-11T17:05:41 <jhernandez> yes, it doesn't make sense to ship these np sets like this
2018-09-11T17:05:50 <clown> right.
2018-09-11T17:06:16 <clown> or should this be a discussion at tomorrow's arch meeting?
2018-09-11T17:06:35 <jhernandez> right, we should define an alternative way to load that data
2018-09-11T17:07:25 <jhernandez> potentially, by using a set of scripts that can be run by an op that loads the data or the like
2018-09-11T17:07:44 <jhernandez> and yes, it's a topic for tomorrow's arch meeting
2018-09-11T17:08:03 <clown> okay.  so shall I remove that functionality from the data loader?  note that the data loader modifes the database not the prefs server.
2018-09-11T17:08:18 <clown> or wait until the end of the discussion tomorrow?
2018-09-11T17:09:00 * clown 5 minutes is up...
2018-09-11T17:11:38 <jhernandez> we can wait until tomorrow, just in case
2018-09-11T17:12:41 <clown> sure.  thanks jhernandez.  enjoy your evening!
