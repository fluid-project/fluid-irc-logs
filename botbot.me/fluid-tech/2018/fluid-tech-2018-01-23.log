2018-01-23T16:55:50 <avtar> gtirloni: regarding an updated centos vagrant box, that would be awesome
2018-01-23T16:57:04 <avtar> cindyli was experiencing an issue creating this vm https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/documentation/ProductionSetupInstructions.md
2018-01-23T16:58:16 <avtar> one issue is include_tasks not being available in anything but ansible >= 2.4 https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.4/include_tasks_module.html
2018-01-23T16:58:50 <amatas_> just to be sure, is this our official repo: https://github.com/idi-ops/packer-centos ?
2018-01-23T16:58:55 <avtar> amatas: yup
2018-01-23T16:59:49 <amatas_> I\'m busy right now with other tasks, but I can build a new box and check that it has the latests updates.
2018-01-23T16:59:56 <amatas_> later
2018-01-23T17:00:09 <avtar> thanks!
2018-01-23T17:00:29 <avtar> i can work around it for now with "yum update" which pulls in ansible 2.4

2018-01-23T17:26:51 <gtirloni> amatas_ avtar: i should have updated the centos box yesterday when i updated the fedora one, sorry. i\'m uploading the new version now
2018-01-23T17:28:10 <avtar> gtirloni: awesome thanks!
2018-01-23T17:29:26 <avtar> cindyli: this line https://github.com/cindyli/universal/pull/10/files#diff-052a7a2355d9808feb97dc828ff4f753R6 can be removed if you have the new centos box that gtirloni mentioned
2018-01-23T17:29:48 <cindyli> got it, thanks, avtar
2018-01-23T17:33:12 <gtirloni> avtar: cindyli: v20180123
2018-01-23T17:33:20 <gtirloni> vagrant box update --box inclusivedesign/centos7

2018-01-23T18:03:01 <cindyli> gtirloni_: the updated cento7 works great.
2018-01-23T18:03:24 <gtirloni_> cool!
2018-01-23T18:04:06 <cindyli> avtar, your pull request fixes the last bit of the production vm
