2018-02-08T14:50:31 <alanharnum> a useful thing i\'ve just discovered that others may already know about (but I didn\'t): https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/debugger
2018-02-08T14:51:07 <alanharnum> the various browser dev tools all support this and will interpret it as a breakpoint in the code

2018-02-08T17:49:37 <the-t-in-rtf> @Justin_o, my son will be down hopefully in about an hour if you want to chat for a few minutes.
2018-02-08T17:51:17 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf:  i ended up writing my questions on the PR, but if you\'d like to chat about any of that I should be able to. I\'ll be stepping out for a bit, but will also be back in about an hour, so the time should be good.
2018-02-08T18:04:07 <the-t-in-rtf> great, I\'ll look them over.
2018-02-08T18:16:26 <the-t-in-rtf> I responded to your comments, I\'ll be around for a bit if there are follow-up questions.  Unless it\'s super urgent, I was planning to update the code tomorrow.

2018-02-08T19:15:36 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: hey took a look at the PR.. looks like you made a bunch of changes already.. were you planning on making more as well?
2018-02-08T19:15:54 <the-t-in-rtf> No, I did what I could just now.
2018-02-08T19:16:03 <the-t-in-rtf> AFAIK it\'s not possible to change the "test" subcommand.
2018-02-08T19:16:24 <the-t-in-rtf> But I did use the leaner VM and added notes about custom builds within the VM.
2018-02-08T19:17:03 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: okay thanks... so the test subcommand is a bug/limitation of the vagrant plugin
2018-02-08T19:17:13 * colinclark joined the channel
2018-02-08T19:17:20 <the-t-in-rtf> It\'s a feature, yes.
2018-02-08T19:17:29 <Justin_o> :)
2018-02-08T19:17:30 <Justin_o> okay
2018-02-08T19:18:02 <the-t-in-rtf> I still think we get a lot for that little bit of cognitive dissonance.  We\'re not running in CI, or testing, but we can describe our deps and build steps in a YAML file and have it just work.
2018-02-08T19:20:23 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: okay, perhaps filing a ticket against the plugin for now and we can change "test" to "build" or something later..
2018-02-08T19:20:32 <Justin_o> amatas: wondering where i should file a ticket about this https://github.com/jobara/infusion-icons/pull/1/files#r166964236
2018-02-08T19:20:39 <the-t-in-rtf> seems good.
2018-02-08T19:21:01 <the-t-in-rtf> I think @amatas is probably offline, it\'s only a fluke that I\'m here (son asleep, wife out at an event).
2018-02-08T19:21:04 <the-t-in-rtf> It\'s late here.
2018-02-08T19:21:43 <Justin_o> the-t-in-rtf: ah right.. i forgot about the time difference :(

2018-02-08T19:37:19 <amatas> I\'m reading back
2018-02-08T19:37:52 <Justin_o> amatas: thanks, but don\'t worry about it now if you are heading offline.. i was just asking where i should file a ticket against the vagrant plugin
2018-02-08T19:37:55 <amatas> Justin_o: yes, you\'re right. Perhaps the "test" word is not the best option
2018-02-08T19:38:37 <amatas> Justin_o: but I have some suggestions about the same issue in the code review
2018-02-08T19:38:41 <amatas> of the plugin
2018-02-08T19:38:43 <Justin_o> if it can\'t be configurable.. maybe something like "run" similar to npm
2018-02-08T19:38:46 <amatas> let me show you
2018-02-08T19:39:01 <Justin_o> okay

2018-02-08T19:39:32 <amatas> Avtar told me almost the same as you

2018-02-08T19:42:37 <Justin_o> amatas: ah yes... okay.. i\'ll just +1 that comment for now
2018-02-08T19:42:40 <Justin_o> thanks for pointing me at it
2018-02-08T19:44:25 <amatas> np :)

2018-02-08T21:35:18 <simonjb> hi alanharnum
2018-02-08T21:35:26 <alanharnum> hello simonjb
2018-02-08T21:35:52 <simonjb> alanharnum: I\'m working on a paper with Bosmon on co-occurrence and have a section on the science lab demo
2018-02-08T21:36:04 <simonjb> is this accurate? "five presentations were developed: numeric dashboard showing the values of all connected sensors, a bar-graph visualisation, a coloured pH visualisation annotated with the values of common substances, a coloured temperature visualisation, and a pH sonification"
2018-02-08T21:36:14 <simonjb> did we also have a generic sonification?
2018-02-08T21:37:09 <alanharnum> simonjb: we did, yup - colinclark also implemented a temperature sensor one but I didn\'t have time to integrate it
2018-02-08T21:38:12 <simonjb> thanks alanharnum, "a general ranged-value sonification" ?
2018-02-08T21:39:36 <alanharnum> yup - this one here: https://github.com/waharnum/nexus-demos/blob/GPII-2189/science-lab/sensor-presentations/js/sensorPlayer.js#L111
2018-02-08T21:40:03 <alanharnum> "a model-driven synth that scales model values with specified min/max to a min/max frequency range"
2018-02-08T21:41:33 <alanharnum> there are also these two visualizers which were developed during testing, but not actually used: https://github.com/waharnum/nexus-demos/blob/GPII-2189/science-lab/sensor-presentations/js/visualizers/nexusSensorVisualizer-sensorPercentageVisualizers.js
