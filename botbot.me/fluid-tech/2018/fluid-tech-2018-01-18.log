2018-01-18T15:14:00 <colinclark> amatas: Super stoked about your vagrant-gpii-ci PR, thanks for making it
2018-01-18T15:16:28 <amatas_> np colinclark :D, it was a request of the arch meeting of yesterday. Bosmon suggested to make a review by other members of the team. Of course, if you want to add any comment don\'t hesitate to do so.
2018-01-18T15:16:38 <colinclark> that\'s aweomse
2018-01-18T15:16:40 <colinclark> awesome
2018-01-18T15:16:46 <colinclark> i\'ll definitely take a look
2018-01-18T15:16:54 <Bosmon> Oh yes, I was going to nudge about this
2018-01-18T15:17:13 <Bosmon> amatas and ussjoin mentioned that they don\'t have access to the standard GPII organisation
2018-01-18T15:17:23 <Bosmon> So we were wondering what the best place for the "reviewed" version of the plugin repo was
2018-01-18T15:17:52 <amatas_> Bosmon: the repository is located at the "gpii-ops" org ATM
2018-01-18T15:18:36 <amatas_> if the plugin is finally something of general propose of the project I guess that we can move to the gpii official organization
2018-01-18T15:21:09 * avtar joined the channel
2018-01-18T15:22:17 <colinclark> That\'s I think what I\'m proposing we do, amatas_ and Bosmon
2018-01-18T15:22:49 <colinclark> I mean, we could have, alternatively, made a repo for amatas_ in the GPII org and then things could have proceeded as usual
2018-01-18T15:23:02 <colinclark> but my sense is that the "right eyes" are currently more focused on the gpii-ops org
2018-01-18T15:23:25 <colinclark> but as I commented on the PR, my impression, based on the schema that ussjoin and I started to talk through earlier this week, the GPII org is the right place for it long term
2018-01-18T15:23:43 <colinclark> since I believe that gpii-ops will ultimately represent a very differently-governed organization
2018-01-18T15:23:50 <amatas_> right, just saw your comment :)
2018-01-18T15:24:02 <colinclark> much more closely tied to RTF\'s certifications of various kinds for actually *operating* the GPII
2018-01-18T15:24:06 <colinclark> as opposed to the open source core
2018-01-18T15:24:27 <amatas_> makes sense
2018-01-18T15:24:35 <colinclark> And as a "third party user" of vagrant-gpii-ci, I would love to see it fully openly governed\xe2\x80\x94like the other GPII repositories I trust
2018-01-18T15:24:53 <colinclark> whereas gpii-ops I think will, more and more, just contain the stuff RTF needs to operate their instance fo the GPII
2018-01-18T15:24:57 <colinclark> if this makes any sense :)
2018-01-18T15:25:51 <colinclark> so what I\'m proposing is that ussjoin and mrtyler take a look at it when they get a chance, while it is still in gpii-ops, and then we do some additional review and move it over to the main gpii org
2018-01-18T15:31:07 <amatas_> I think it makes sense

2018-01-18T19:15:23 <amatas_> hi avtar!
2018-01-18T19:15:30 <avtar> how\'s it going?
2018-01-18T19:15:41 * alanharnum has quit
2018-01-18T19:15:46 <amatas_> it\'s going well
2018-01-18T19:15:49 * alanharnum joined the channel
2018-01-18T19:16:02 <avtar> do you have a sec to verify something?
2018-01-18T19:16:07 <amatas_> sure
2018-01-18T19:17:14 <avtar> is this a valid .vagrant.yml config? https://gist.githubusercontent.com/anonymous/88dfc6eebf959c312083270f984620f9/raw/fba98a7ab70ee2d8342a63d486f82638a72a0c99/gistfile1.txt
2018-01-18T19:17:59 <amatas_> let me check it
2018-01-18T19:18:34 <mrtyler> This page is in Portuguese. Would you like to translate it?
2018-01-18T19:19:49 <amatas_> avtar: it seems valid
2018-01-18T19:19:55 <amatas_> mrtyler: WAT?
2018-01-18T19:20:25 <avtar> amatas_: ok good, i thought i was b0rking something on my end, although there\'s a chance that might still be the case
2018-01-18T19:20:34 <mrtyler> don\'t ask me, ask chrome :p
2018-01-18T19:21:09 <avtar> amatas_: when i test it with \'vagrant up\' i see the following:
2018-01-18T19:21:14 <avtar> There was an error while executing `VBoxManage`, a CLI used by Vagrant
2018-01-18T19:21:14 <avtar> for controlling VirtualBox. The command and stderr is shown below.
2018-01-18T19:21:14 <avtar> Command: ["startvm", "2c28695f-19fb-4f53-9c3a-1d454a95d0a7", "--type", "gui"]
2018-01-18T19:21:49 <amatas_> mmm, in fact I just copy your config and now I have a Centos VM running
2018-01-18T19:22:03 <amatas_> which version of virtualbox are you using?
2018-01-18T19:22:10 <amatas_> and vagrant?
2018-01-18T19:22:39 <avtar> virtualbox 5.1.12 and vagrant 1.9.8
2018-01-18T19:23:04 <amatas_> I\'m using vagrant 2.0.1 but I don\'t think that the problem is on the version
2018-01-18T19:23:17 <amatas_> can you spin up a vm using a traditional Vagrantfile?
2018-01-18T19:24:02 <avtar> i could a couple weeks ago
2018-01-18T19:24:04 <avtar> one sec
2018-01-18T19:24:20 <amatas_> try to add the option to show the gui at the beggining
2018-01-18T19:29:57 <avtar> same deal with gui enabled
2018-01-18T19:30:10 <avtar> i\'ll try a newer virtualbox release
2018-01-18T19:34:33 <amatas_> mm ok
2018-01-18T19:34:38 <avtar> yeah that did it
2018-01-18T19:34:46 <avtar> upgraded to 5.1.32
2018-01-18T19:34:48 <amatas_> awesome!
2018-01-18T19:34:53 <avtar> thanks for the help :)
2018-01-18T19:35:21 <amatas_> JFYI I\'m using 5.2.6 and seems to work with all our stuff
2018-01-18T19:35:30 <amatas_> np
2018-01-18T19:35:51 <avtar> i\'m weary of upgrading laughing_sweating.emoji
2018-01-18T19:40:29 <amatas_> so if it\'s working don\'t touch then
