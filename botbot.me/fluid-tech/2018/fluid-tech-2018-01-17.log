2018-01-17T15:47:18 <stegru> amatas, mrtyler - I\'m looking for a better way than storing the installer in a google drive - I can\'t use github because the source (and executable) contains the password
2018-01-17T15:47:24 <stegru> any suggestions?
2018-01-17T15:48:26 <jhernandez> stegru: which password?
2018-01-17T15:48:45 <stegru> this one: "Password1234!"
2018-01-17T15:48:48 <amatas_> compressed file with password? :P , anyway Google Drive is fine if the access is restricted.
2018-01-17T15:48:50 <jhernandez> haha
2018-01-17T15:48:58 <amatas_> haha
2018-01-17T15:49:26 <jhernandez> stegru: I mean, for what purpose is that password?
2018-01-17T15:49:28 <stegru> the installer for filebeat.. the thing that Han installs on the pilot computers, to gather the mean metrics
2018-01-17T15:49:30 <jhernandez> ah
2018-01-17T15:49:33 <jhernandez> ok ok ok
2018-01-17T15:50:01 <stegru> it\'s restricted to raising the floor - is that enough?
2018-01-17T15:50:11 <jhernandez> I think google drive is fine
2018-01-17T15:50:30 <jhernandez> and yeah, restricted to rtf accounts
2018-01-17T15:50:32 <amatas_> stegru: I don\'t know how many members rtf has
2018-01-17T15:51:01 <jhernandez> in any case, I think that it\'s Han the only one who is going to use such installer, isn\'t it?
2018-01-17T15:51:06 <amatas_> perhaps if only you and han has access is fine
2018-01-17T15:51:28 <stegru> yes, and you
2018-01-17T15:51:29 <amatas_> and someone that want to test it
2018-01-17T15:51:36 <jhernandez> if, by any chance, I need it, I can ask for permissions
2018-01-17T15:51:38 <amatas_> like me, yes
2018-01-17T15:51:45 <jhernandez> like us
2018-01-17T15:51:52 <stegru> javi, we\'re only allowing trustworthy people
2018-01-17T15:51:52 <jhernandez> :P
2018-01-17T15:52:06 * jhernandez hides
2018-01-17T15:52:13 <stegru> so i\'ll remove myself ;)
2018-01-17T15:52:16 <jhernandez> hahaha
