2018-05-10T21:43:16 <gtirloni> heads up: docker hub is down (https://status.docker.com/)
2018-05-10T21:46:54 <gtirloni> colinclark: hi! do you know if the TTS server is still used? I noticed the git repo got archived... but it's missing my PR for docker

2018-05-10T22:07:30 <colinclark> hey gtirloni, sorry for the delay
2018-05-10T22:07:38 <colinclark> the TTS server is still used by one of our older Preferences Framework demos
2018-05-10T22:08:03 <colinclark> this one, I believe: https://build.fluidproject.org/prefsEditors/demos/explorationTool/
2018-05-10T22:08:34 <gtirloni> ah ok, thanks. i'll fix the docker image and upload it to the hub, no worries
2018-05-10T22:08:47 <colinclark> I'm not sure why it was mothballed if it needs your PR to work :)
2018-05-10T22:08:52 <colinclark> Should I merge it into the repo?
2018-05-10T22:09:00 <gtirloni> i don't know if you can now, it's read-only
2018-05-10T22:09:03 <colinclark> ah
2018-05-10T22:09:12 <colinclark> that's one we should perhaps mention to Justin_o when he's around
2018-05-10T22:09:27 <gtirloni> ok will do. i'll just upload a image from my machine and will check with him tomorrow
2018-05-10T22:09:29 <gtirloni> thanks!
2018-05-10T22:09:30 <colinclark> ok great
2018-05-10T22:09:33 <colinclark> sorry about that, gtirloni
2018-05-10T22:09:36 <gtirloni> np :)
