2018-04-30T12:57:51 <Justin_o> gtirloni: is this why i was seeing slow downs in my test runs through the vagrant vm https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6277

2018-04-30T13:00:12 <gtirloni> i'm not sure, i only focused on the node tests which is what was consuming a lot of memory. the browser tests seemed okay and never failed in my tests
2018-04-30T13:00:26 <gtirloni> but it could be related
2018-04-30T13:05:23 <Justin_o> okay thanks
2018-04-30T13:07:48 <gtirloni> something i didn't understand was if the code is instrumented in the browser tests step.. and then if that code is necessary in the node tests, if there's a relation
2018-04-30T13:08:09 <gtirloni> when i ran the node tests before the browser tests on a clean checkout, it seemed to work fine
2018-04-30T13:08:32 <gtirloni> so i was wondering if this is a unintended side effect of the instrumented code (having an impact on node tests)
2018-04-30T13:09:56 <Justin_o> gtirloni: yah i'm not sure. I guess the reporting will cover both, but not sure if there are any other interactions.. the-t-in-rtf would know best. I think he should be back next week

2018-04-30T13:55:54 <the-t-in-rtf> Hi, @gtirloni.
2018-04-30T13:56:08 <the-t-in-rtf> In almost all cases the preinstrumented code is only used in the browser tests.
2018-04-30T13:56:14 <the-t-in-rtf> The only exception is the gpii-app tests.
2018-04-30T13:56:32 <the-t-in-rtf> nyc takes care of the instrumentation for node code, by hooking babel into the require method.
2018-04-30T13:56:51 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, if you haven't figured it out by Friday afternoon, I should be around again.
2018-04-30T14:01:25 <gtirloni> thank you!
