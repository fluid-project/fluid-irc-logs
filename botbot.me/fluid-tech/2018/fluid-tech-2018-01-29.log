2018-01-29T21:16:40 <simonjb> hey cindyli
2018-01-29T21:17:11 <simonjb> so, I\'m hitting some problems trying to test your GPII-2662 changes with the windows VM
2018-01-29T21:18:00 <simonjb> have you by any chance run this setup successfully?
2018-01-29T21:18:33 <simonjb> what I\'m seeing is that the vagrant up command is getting stuck
2018-01-29T21:19:02 <simonjb> I have successfully brought the vm up as it is from github
2018-01-29T21:19:05 <simonjb> took 25 mins
2018-01-29T21:19:27 <simonjb> but I have tried twice to start with your universal#GPII-2622
2018-01-29T21:19:33 <simonjb> and both times it got stuck
2018-01-29T21:19:36 <simonjb> no error
2018-01-29T21:19:39 <simonjb> just stuck
2018-01-29T21:19:57 <simonjb> the most recent run has now been 50mins
2018-01-29T21:20:36 <simonjb> stuck at: "default: Cloning into \'C:\\installer\'..."
2018-01-29T21:20:48 <simonjb> the last time it was stuck at a different point
2018-01-29T21:21:24 <simonjb> have you seen this?
2018-01-29T21:23:17 <simonjb> I will stop it and try again
2018-01-29T21:24:38 <simonjb> it seems unlikely to be related to your work, but possibly another change on universal?
2018-01-29T21:38:33 <cindyli> simonjb: i didn\'t try the windows vm. trying now...
2018-01-29T21:39:23 <simonjb> with your GPII-2662?
2018-01-29T21:39:54 <simonjb> cindyli ^
2018-01-29T21:40:00 <cindyli> ya
2018-01-29T21:40:15 <simonjb> I captured the output from the 2 runs and I\'m seeing quite a few differences
2018-01-29T21:40:58 <simonjb> "GPII/universal#694422fc218ed6fdb31278242e67cf2fec8b8901" vs "cindyli/universal#GPII-2662"
2018-01-29T21:42:20 <cindyli> which step did you see that difference, simonjb. i guess i will see it soon. upgrading vagrant
2018-01-29T21:42:21 <simonjb> looks like the universal that windows master is using is from last October
2018-01-29T21:42:22 <simonjb> https://github.com/GPII/universal/commit/694422fc218ed6fdb31278242e67cf2fec8b8901
2018-01-29T21:43:02 <cindyli> ok, quite long time ago
2018-01-29T21:43:26 <simonjb> yes, I wonder if it has been broken in the time since then
2018-01-29T21:43:46 <simonjb> I\'m going to try again anyway now
2018-01-29T21:43:56 <cindyli> thanks, simonjb
2018-01-29T21:44:07 <cindyli> i guess we can also try it with the current master
2018-01-29T21:44:37 <simonjb> yes, I didn\'t try that (you mean the current universal master, right?)
2018-01-29T21:44:41 <cindyli> i will try the master before trying with GPII-2662
2018-01-29T21:44:45 <cindyli> yes
2018-01-29T21:44:46 <simonjb> cool
2018-01-29T21:44:59 <simonjb> my guess is that it isn\'t your changes
2018-01-29T21:45:06 <simonjb> but it\'s hard to know right now
2018-01-29T21:45:27 <simonjb> I\'ll try your GPII-2662 again
2018-01-29T21:49:43 <simonjb> I\'m running vagrant 2.0.1 and virtualbox 5.1.32
2018-01-29T21:50:26 <simonjb> cindyli: I\'ll upload my vagrant run output to gist
2018-01-29T21:50:34 <cindyli> thanks, simonjb
2018-01-29T21:50:47 <cindyli> I\'m running virtualbox 5.2.6 and vagrant is the same version as u
2018-01-29T21:51:18 <cindyli> updating windows vm box, it needs 12 more mins to finish
2018-01-29T21:54:55 <simonjb> cindyli: successful https://gist.github.com/simonbates/694a2017aefc4e30501686d07cb9e4e0
2018-01-29T21:55:04 <simonjb> stuck https://gist.github.com/simonbates/272daa3a14a24372bbdd5f14f3f4b8e8
2018-01-29T21:56:28 <cindyli> simonjb: is the successful one using the old universal commit?
2018-01-29T21:56:47 <simonjb> yes, as is from github
2018-01-29T21:58:01 <cindyli> ok
2018-01-29T21:59:02 <simonjb> one difference I noticed was the output from npm install
2018-01-29T21:59:17 <simonjb> there\'s a lot more complaints on the GPII-2662 run
2018-01-29T21:59:18 <simonjb> https://gist.github.com/simonbates/694a2017aefc4e30501686d07cb9e4e0#file-20180129_gpii_windows_master_vagrant_up-txt-L7831
2018-01-29T21:59:20 <simonjb> vs
2018-01-29T21:59:28 <simonjb> https://gist.github.com/simonbates/272daa3a14a24372bbdd5f14f3f4b8e8#file-20180129_gpii_windows_gpii-2662_vagrant_stuck-txt-L7861
2018-01-29T21:59:35 <simonjb> may not be significant though
2018-01-29T22:00:50 * clown has quit
2018-01-29T22:11:49 <simonjb> cindyli: it\'s been 25 mins and though not finished, it got past where it was stuck
2018-01-29T22:13:05 <simonjb> cindyli: ok, finished this time!
2018-01-29T22:13:26 <simonjb> cindyli: so it might be nothing to do with universal
2018-01-29T22:13:38 <cindyli> which commit do you run this time, simonjb?
2018-01-29T22:13:51 <simonjb> your GPII-2662
2018-01-29T22:13:53 <cindyli> i mean universal commit
2018-01-29T22:13:58 <cindyli> ok
2018-01-29T22:14:12 <simonjb> cindyli/universal#GPII-2662
2018-01-29T22:14:15 <cindyli> you said it got past this time?
2018-01-29T22:14:17 <cindyli> no stuck?
2018-01-29T22:14:23 <simonjb> yes, finished
2018-01-29T22:14:37 <simonjb> got stuck twice before but finished on the third run
2018-01-29T22:15:04 <cindyli> umm\xe2\x80\xa6 wonder what happened in the first two times
2018-01-29T22:15:27 <simonjb> no idea, I didn\'t get an error just appeared to get stuck
2018-01-29T22:15:40 <simonjb> the second one I gave 50 mins
2018-01-29T22:15:48 <simonjb> the first that got stuck I didn\'t time
2018-01-29T22:15:59 <cindyli> that\'s long wait
2018-01-29T22:16:05 <simonjb> but I think somewhere between 30-45 mins
2018-01-29T22:16:17 <cindyli> now you can try /login and /logout
2018-01-29T22:16:19 <simonjb> the successful runs are 25 mins or so
2018-01-29T22:16:22 <simonjb> yes
2018-01-29T22:17:23 <simonjb> cindyli: I will pause now I think and test them tomorrow
2018-01-29T22:17:39 <simonjb> being careful to shut the vm down and not destroy it!
2018-01-29T22:17:43 <cindyli> sure, simonjb. thanks a lot
2018-01-29T22:18:05 <simonjb> sorry to bug you with this -- I think it has nothing to do with your work
2018-01-29T22:18:48 <cindyli> not a problem. I should try it too anyway ;)
