2018-07-26T17:26:33 <clown> next question:  how?  vidyo?
2018-07-26T17:26:51 <clown> or just IRC?
2018-07-26T17:30:59 * cindyli joined the channel
2018-07-26T17:57:00 <mrtyler> clown: heh we definitely want real-time communication. specific method doesn\'t matter to me, except that the only thing i know how to do with vidyo is follow a link to join someone\'s room :)
2018-07-26T17:57:24 * clown starts vidyo
2018-07-26T17:57:43 <mrtyler> oh actually, we have other people joining
2018-07-26T17:57:54 <mrtyler> who i don\'t necessarily want to have wrestle with vidyo
2018-07-26T17:58:05 * clown quits vidyo
2018-07-26T17:58:06 <mrtyler> can we use skype? or can i create you a slack account and use that?
2018-07-26T17:58:08 <mrtyler> haha
2018-07-26T17:58:23 * clown starts skype (hasn\'t used skype in years)
2018-07-26T17:58:38 <mrtyler> you\'re in for a treat! it\'s owned by microsoft now, and it\'s an electron app :p
2018-07-26T17:59:41 <clown> yeah, I know about the M$ ownership.  News that it\'s using electron.  Wonders of wonders:  I remembed my password.
2018-07-26T17:59:47 <clown> *remembered
2018-07-26T18:00:05 <mrtyler> that\'s why you should always use \'hunter2\' as your password
2018-07-26T18:00:19 <clown> lol
2018-07-26T18:01:05 <clown> interesting message from skype:  "your contacts have not been active lately".  hah!
2018-07-26T18:01:55 <mrtyler> heh, my skype still features a lot of coworkers from two jobs ago at a company that no longer exists
2018-07-26T18:01:56 <clown> lots of \'mrtyler\' in skype-land.
2018-07-26T18:02:13 <mrtyler> my skype id is tylermr :)
2018-07-26T18:02:58 <clown> i\'m "clown-"
2018-07-26T18:04:03 <mrtyler> ooh, i also spotted a german theology student i used to play chess with

2018-07-26T19:58:33 <clown> mrtyler: changing my password gives:  "Either user is not authorized to perform iam:ChangePassword or entered password does not comply with account password policy set by administrator"
2018-07-26T19:58:45 <clown> If it\'s the latter, what is the password policy?
2018-07-26T20:00:09 <mrtyler> i think it\'s upper, lower, digit
2018-07-26T20:00:28 <mrtyler> and some min length
2018-07-26T20:01:03 <mrtyler> ok lol i found it. min length 12, 1 upper, 1 lower, 1 number, 1 nonalpha
2018-07-26T20:01:26 <mrtyler> i\'m adding it to the doc
2018-07-26T20:03:54 * cindyli joined the channel
2018-07-26T20:05:18 * michelled joined the channel
2018-07-26T20:08:22 <clown> is there a maximum length, mrtyler?  (mine is 15).  I was missing a nonalpha, but now I\'m not, and still getting that error message.
2018-07-26T20:12:30 <clown> okay, works now, mrtyler.  For some reason, it didn\'t like quesiton marks , "?"
2018-07-26T20:14:05 <clown> or "question" marks, even
2018-07-26T20:26:13 <mrtyler> heh, well, ask amazon about that one i guess :)
