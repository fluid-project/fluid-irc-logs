2018-01-26T16:57:59 <ussjoin> stegru: Went through and responded to your questions/comments, so LMK if all of that makes sense to you / if you have others. (And thank you for the ultra-fast turnaround!)

2018-01-26T21:07:26 <stegru> ussjoin: thanks for this. about the client certs.. I\'ve also done it before (the client enrollment) and it\'s not fun at all - but neither is dealing with the hassle of introducing email (would you allow a "black box" on your network sending out emails at will?)
2018-01-26T21:08:43 <stegru> cindyli: have you had any thoughts on 2FA lately?
2018-01-26T21:09:49 <cindyli> stegru: 2FA for what use case?
2018-01-26T21:10:01 <stegru> in general, in GPII?
2018-01-26T21:11:46 <cindyli> no, i think
2018-01-26T21:16:24 <stegru> ok thanks
