2018-01-05T15:59:23 <michelled> gmoss: yesterday you mentioned that you wanted to have a special community meeting - was it about the SJRK storage strategy?
2018-01-05T16:13:01 <gmoss> hi michelled, my contenders for possible reasons were: SJRK storage strategy (colinclark suggested this possibility as well, and it's a strong one), Infusion design patterns, or something related to SJRK that we wanted James to be able to comment on. But I think you and Colin may be correct
2018-01-05T16:14:41 <colinclark> but as you mentioned gmoss, maybe it's better as a smaller meeting?
2018-01-05T16:14:43 <michelled> yes, gmoss, I have a note that we wanted to talk to Tony and Antranig about the storage strategy to make sure we were all on a similar page
2018-01-05T16:14:47 <colinclark> or rather, a more informal one?
2018-01-05T16:15:11 <michelled> we certainly need to schedule so Tony and Antranig are there. And Simon and Alan :)
2018-01-05T16:15:50 <colinclark> the community meeting time is a particularly bad one for the-t-in-rtf, I know
2018-01-05T16:15:55 <gmoss> colinclark: yes, exactly. the nature of the subject matter struck me as odd for a community meeting, which is why i wondered if it was indeed that. the value of such a meeting is clear, but I wonder if there wasn't something else :)
2018-01-05T16:16:01 <colinclark> so let's aim for something int he morning in a week or two
2018-01-05T16:16:14 <colinclark> we've had quite technical community meetings in the past, gmoss
2018-01-05T16:16:21 <colinclark> I think it's less about subject matter and more about... scope?
2018-01-05T16:16:27 <colinclark> I'm not sure what the word I'm looking for is
2018-01-05T16:16:53 <gmoss> intent?
2018-01-05T16:17:44 <colinclark> breadth, perhaps
2018-01-05T16:17:46 <colinclark> i dunno
2018-01-05T16:17:47 <colinclark> anyway :)
2018-01-05T16:18:15 <colinclark> my vote is to follow your gut and schedule something a bit more informal
2018-01-05T16:19:37 <gmoss> very good, I will do so :)
