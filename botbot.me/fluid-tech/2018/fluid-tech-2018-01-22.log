2018-01-22T09:36:32 <the-t-in-rtf> Morning @jhernandez.
2018-01-22T09:36:46 <the-t-in-rtf> Just wanted to see if there was a ticket I could watch for the parts of linux master that are broken.
2018-01-22T09:37:09 <the-t-in-rtf> We talked about it WRT the code coverage pull, just wanted to keep track of that and nudge again when the time is right.

2018-01-22T12:14:51 <jhernandez> the-t-in-rtf: hey
2018-01-22T12:15:20 <jhernandez> I haven't had time to deep dive into it, but this is the brief report https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2795
2018-01-22T12:15:35 <jhernandez> it has to do with node 8
2018-01-22T12:16:14 <jhernandez> so we can workaround by not using it
2018-01-22T12:20:12 <the-t-in-rtf> thanks, good to know.
2018-01-22T12:20:30 <the-t-in-rtf> I'm watching the issue, I'm sure we'll have lots of conversations around monorepos, etc. soon.
