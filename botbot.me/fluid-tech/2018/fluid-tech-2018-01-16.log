2018-01-16T16:39:59 <colinclark> hey mrtyler and ussjoin: what do you think of meeting up sometime later today or tomorrow to chat a bit more about our next steps with the vault pull request?
2018-01-16T16:45:53 <ussjoin> Fine by me. I\'ve received and addressed just a couple of small comments.
2018-01-16T16:46:35 <colinclark> ok cool
2018-01-16T16:47:21 <colinclark> any particular time work for you, ussjoin?
2018-01-16T16:48:06 <ussjoin> All the same to me, some slight preference for morning PST but I can be flexible.
2018-01-16T16:48:37 <colinclark> so I\'ve got a 1pm EST meeting today and otherwise free
2018-01-16T16:48:59 <colinclark> tomorrow i\'m pretty much looking at my afternoon\xe2\x80\x943pm or beyond
2018-01-16T16:52:20 <colinclark> how about you, mrtyler?
2018-01-16T16:52:29 <mrtyler> all fine for me
2018-01-16T16:52:39 <mrtyler> i was going to say tmrw might be a bit easier but definitely not a big deal if your schedule is impacted
2018-01-16T16:53:18 <mrtyler> i have my first avy class tomorrow but not until 2100 eastern :)
2018-01-16T16:53:24 <colinclark> oh cool!
2018-01-16T16:53:54 <colinclark> the earliest I think I can do tomorrow is noon PST, ussjoin
2018-01-16T16:54:02 <colinclark> 1 pm PST would be ace
2018-01-16T16:54:13 <mrtyler> wfm
2018-01-16T17:00:31 <ussjoin> I have a 1pm meeting tomorrow.
2018-01-16T17:00:58 <ussjoin> (Sorry.) I could do 1pm today, or ~1:30 tomorrow.
2018-01-16T17:02:28 <mrtyler> sorry, what timezone are those?
2018-01-16T17:02:37 <mrtyler> i think both are fine
2018-01-16T17:03:02 <ussjoin> PST.
2018-01-16T17:03:31 <mrtyler> wfm
2018-01-16T17:26:42 <colinclark> 1:30 pm PST is fine for me
2018-01-16T17:26:44 <colinclark> tomorrow

2018-01-16T18:19:57 <clown> hi stegru
2018-01-16T18:20:00 <clown> Do you have any more issues with my pull request:  https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/156 ?
2018-01-16T18:22:48 * kasparnet joined the channel
2018-01-16T18:23:19 <stegru> ji clown .. no
2018-01-16T18:23:46 <stegru> well, i have a very small problem - why is the file extention ".csx"?
2018-01-16T18:24:28 <clown> stegru, I don\'t recall exactly.  To the best of my recollection, I was following the tutorial.
2018-01-16T18:24:47 <clown> "if it ain\'t broke, don\' t fix it" ?
2018-01-16T18:25:44 <stegru> i\'ve just googled it, and it\'s a "C# Script" - I guess that\'s accurate for the way we use it
2018-01-16T18:25:54 <stegru> i was just curious, that\'s all - never seen it before
2018-01-16T18:28:17 <clown> I see.  Here\'s the quote from the tutorial:
2018-01-16T18:28:17 <clown> > If your C# code grows substantially, it is useful to keep it in a separate file. You can save it to a file with *.csx or *.cs extension, and then reference from your Node.js application:
2018-01-16T18:28:17 <clown> > var add7 = edge.func(require(\'path\').join(__dirname, \'add7.csx\'));
2018-01-16T18:28:40 <clown> The README.md, actually.  https://github.com/tjanczuk/edge
2018-01-16T18:28:52 <stegru> ok, interesting
2018-01-16T18:30:26 <clown> and, the "samples" folder, if there is any C# file, it has a .csx extension.  https://github.com/tjanczuk/edge/tree/master/samples
2018-01-16T18:30:52 <clown> bottom line:  I don\'t know.  I was just copying the author
2018-01-16T18:36:58 <stegru> ok, well, you\'ll have to ask one of the gatekeepers to merge it in - kasparnet is obviously happy with it because he\'s used it
2018-01-16T18:39:15 <clown> stegru, you are not a gate keeper?  Okay, I\'ll ask kasparnet.
2018-01-16T18:39:28 <stegru> no, just a troll
2018-01-16T18:39:43 <clown> lol
2018-01-16T18:39:57 <clown> me, I\'m a drow.
2018-01-16T18:40:17 <mrtyler> i\'m pretty sure Zuul is the gatekeeper, not kasparnet ;)
2018-01-16T18:40:58 <mrtyler> there is no kasparnet, only Zuul
2018-01-16T18:42:01 <clown> zuul is the gatekeeper of gozer.  is that synonymous with gpii?
2018-01-16T18:42:21 <clown> kaspernet, are you around?
2018-01-16T18:42:35 <clown> rather, kasparnet ^
2018-01-16T18:42:57 <mrtyler> heh, it might be
2018-01-16T18:43:04 <stegru> it\'s 1942 for him
2018-01-16T18:43:10 <stegru> the time, not the year
2018-01-16T18:43:15 <mrtyler> we should monitor kaspar\'s refrigerator for strange behavior
2018-01-16T18:45:17 <stegru> he\'s a friendly ghost
2018-01-16T18:45:19 <clown> well, kasparnet doesn\'t look anything like Sigourney
2018-01-16T18:51:03 <mrtyler> maybe if we got him a perm...
2018-01-16T18:51:17 <clown> and hid the beard
