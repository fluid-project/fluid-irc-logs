2018-01-30T16:35:42 <gtirloni> amatas: hi! i noticed the win7/8/81 and a few win10 vagrant boxes were updated 9 months ago, which means they've expired by now. Do you know if anyone is using or planning to use them? I was wondering if we can declutter those

2018-01-30T17:19:29 <the-t-in-rtf> @gtirloni, I only use them when testing issues unique to @Bosmon's machine.
2018-01-30T17:20:08 <the-t-in-rtf> I use the Windows 10 boxes for all of the rest of my work.
2018-01-30T17:20:20 <gtirloni> cool, thanks
2018-01-30T17:20:38 <gtirloni> but i didn't know we had a 3.11 for workgroups box
2018-01-30T17:20:41 * gtirloni looks at Bosmon
2018-01-30T17:20:44 <gtirloni> :P
2018-01-30T17:21:09 <gtirloni> i probably meant os/2 though :)
2018-01-30T17:22:08 <gtirloni> the-t-in-rtf: do you know if kavya does some tests on win7/8 routinely? maybe she's our biggest user right now, I think

2018-01-30T17:37:25 <Bosmon> Sure
2018-01-30T17:37:34 <Bosmon> My Warp 3.0 VM is highly prized
2018-01-30T17:37:52 <Bosmon> It's just a little disturbing how small a 640x480 screen appears on my monitor .....

2018-01-30T17:57:53 <the-t-in-rtf> ha.
2018-01-30T17:57:59 <the-t-in-rtf> @gtirloni, no idea.
2018-01-30T17:58:20 <the-t-in-rtf> The real question is whether that's a target platform or there are unique supported browsers there.
2018-01-30T18:05:28 <gtirloni> makes sense
2018-01-30T18:05:50 <amatas> gtirloni: I built the complete catalog because was a request of test GPII on all those versions. But it seems that at the end only win10 x64 with apps is the machine used
2018-01-30T18:06:34 <gtirloni> thanks, my memory is failing about the details
