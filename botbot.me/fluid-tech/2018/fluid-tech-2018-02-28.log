2018-02-28T18:15:34 <cindyli> Bosmon: i\'m fixing the browser channel example. The problem is running `node browserChannelClient.js` returns undefined initial settings. here\'s the message:
2018-02-28T18:15:36 <cindyli> ## Socket connected
2018-02-28T18:15:36 <cindyli> ## Received the following message: {"type":"connectionSucceeded"}
2018-02-28T18:15:36 <cindyli> ## Got initial settings  undefined  on connection
2018-02-28T18:16:14 <cindyli> so i traced into the web socket settings handler and found the initial model.settings is not populated - https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/settingsHandlers/src/WebSocketsSettingsHandler.js#L65
2018-02-28T18:16:57 <cindyli> but i didn\'t find where the initial setting gets retrieved and set, at least not from .set() in this settings handler
2018-02-28T18:18:29 <cindyli> my question is, how does initial model value gets populated when using settings handler?

2018-02-28T20:11:30 <Bosmon> cindyli - you\'ll be familiar with this answer :)
2018-02-28T20:11:33 <Bosmon> It is from the mocks
2018-02-28T20:12:41 * alanharnum has quit
2018-02-28T20:19:32 <cindyli> Bosmon: good advice. seems from gpii.test.integration.mockSettingsHandlerRegistry.populate(). tracing deeper...
2018-02-28T20:22:59 * stegru joined the channel
2018-02-28T20:30:08 <cindyli> Bosmon: the tracing shows gpii.test.integration.mockSettingsHandlerRegistry.populate() just overrides get()/set() in the settings handler with mock get()/set() but the mock get() never gets called to populate the initial settings too. Also tried with starting GPII with gpii.config.development.all.local, which uses the real get(). it\'s the same that this get() is never called for populating the initial settings.
2018-02-28T20:30:28 <cindyli> the initial settings has never been attempted to populate. is this right?
2018-02-28T20:31:00 <cindyli> i probably should revert to an old commit to find out how this workflow works before
2018-02-28T20:44:39 <cindyli> Bosmon: a good and bad news is, i reverted the universal to the commit when this example was first created - 12e4214d2669d05b9d6d7d311cd5a72443ab82a4
2018-02-28T20:44:50 <cindyli> guess what?
2018-02-28T20:45:07 <cindyli> exactly the same message i\'m receiving now...
2018-02-28T20:45:09 <cindyli> ## Socket connected
2018-02-28T20:45:09 <cindyli> ## Received the following message: {"type":"connectionSucceeded"}
2018-02-28T20:45:09 <cindyli> ## Got initial settings  undefined  on connection
2018-02-28T20:46:04 <cindyli> does it mean, receiving undefined initial settings is the right behavior
2018-02-28T20:46:57 <Bosmon> cindyli - if noone is logged on, yes
2018-02-28T20:47:03 <Bosmon> Sorry, I was wrong about the mocks
2018-02-28T20:47:11 <Bosmon> I was confused : P
2018-02-28T20:47:15 <Bosmon> Of course, this is a live test
2018-02-28T20:47:22 <cindyli> not a problem. glad it\'s the right behavior
2018-02-28T20:47:23 <Bosmon> So you will get whatever settings the logged-on user has
2018-02-28T20:47:30 <cindyli> i see

2018-02-28T21:10:38 <cindyli> Bosmon: it seems the initial settings are always undefined regardless a user is logged in or not. tried with login "uioPlus_defaults" first before running the example, also received undefined initial settings, which makes sense as the earlier debugging shows that the settings handler (mock or not mock) get() method was never called for creating the initial.
2018-02-28T21:12:14 <cindyli> if so, the current pull request is good enough - https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/586
2018-02-28T21:12:19 <cindyli> nothing needs to be fixed further
