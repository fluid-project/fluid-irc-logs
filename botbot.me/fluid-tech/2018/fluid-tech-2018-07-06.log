2018-07-06T18:36:52 <jhernandez> gtirloni: btw, watching brazil vs belgium, not looking good at all for you :/
2018-07-06T18:38:01 <gtirloni> you're assuming i'm cheering for brazil :P
2018-07-06T18:42:43 <gtirloni> but yeah, we're so good at scoring that we scored the first goal.. on the wrong side of the field
2018-07-06T18:42:56 <gtirloni> and the second goal was awesome.. 2x0 seems very fair right now
2018-07-06T18:43:25 <gtirloni> jhernandez: have you applied for naturalization already? :)
2018-07-06T18:44:17 <jhernandez> haha, not yet
2018-07-06T18:45:01 <jhernandez> but yes, belgium is doing very good job on the world cup this time
2018-07-06T18:49:29 <gtirloni> indeed
