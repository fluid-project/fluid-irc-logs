2018-05-17T12:47:08 <gtirloni> alanharnum: hi alan! almost done here... i\'m just seeing something weird: if I access the following URL using a browser, it returns 200 OK... if I use curl, it says 404...
2018-05-17T12:47:09 <gtirloni> https://stories.floeproject.org/stories
2018-05-17T12:47:42 <gtirloni> alanharnum: i would like to use that as a healthcheck URL to determine when everything is up (including the DB), in case you think some other URL would be better for that...
2018-05-17T12:49:00 <alanharnum> gtirloni: interesting, let me check if it\'s an issue on the local environment - it may be an issue with the handler
2018-05-17T12:49:07 <gtirloni> with chrome:
2018-05-17T12:49:09 <gtirloni> 12:48:32.645:  Invoking handler sjrk.storyTelling.server.browseStoriesHandler for route /stories/ with expectedGrade kettle.request.http
2018-05-17T12:49:11 <gtirloni> with curl
2018-05-17T12:49:16 <gtirloni> Kettle server getDispatcher found no matching handlers, continuing
2018-05-17T12:51:04 <alanharnum> yeah, all the URLs seem to return a 404 with curl on the local as well - investigating
2018-05-17T12:52:31 <alanharnum> gtirloni: interestingly, I can see the server responding in different ways to curl -I on a URL versus regular curl
2018-05-17T12:52:50 <gtirloni> oh, interesting
2018-05-17T12:52:55 <gtirloni> that\'s what I was using -I
2018-05-17T12:53:39 <gtirloni> so HTTP HEAD
2018-05-17T12:54:00 <alanharnum> ah OK, that makes sense
2018-05-17T12:54:27 <alanharnum> Express handlers (and thus Kettle handlers) are specific in which HTTP method they respond to
2018-05-17T12:54:39 <gtirloni> ok
2018-05-17T12:54:45 <gtirloni> no worries, I can use a regular request
2018-05-17T12:54:49 <gtirloni> thanks for checking that
2018-05-17T12:56:54 <gtirloni> alanharnum: could you add the usual webhook for jenkins? https://ci.inclusivedesign.ca/github-webhook/
2018-05-17T12:57:09 <gtirloni> x-www-form-urlencoded
2018-05-17T12:57:26 <gtirloni> just the push event should be enough
2018-05-17T12:57:53 * kasparnet joined the channel
2018-05-17T12:58:01 <alanharnum> gtirloni: done
2018-05-17T12:59:34 <gtirloni> alanharnum: https://ci.inclusivedesign.ca/view/Stacks/
2018-05-17T13:00:01 <gtirloni> two jobs, one for each app
2018-05-17T13:00:11 <gtirloni> and a third one to clean the database of the learning reflections app
2018-05-17T13:00:24 <gtirloni> it\'ll be triggered midnight, and then trigger a new build of the learning reflections app
2018-05-17T13:00:42 <alanharnum> gtirloni: brilliant - I see it erased the story I entered last night as a test, which is what I\'d expect :)
2018-05-17T13:00:58 <gtirloni> yeah, i tested it a few times and it seemed to work
2018-05-17T13:01:13 <gtirloni> i\'ll reply to your email with details and the password
2018-05-17T13:01:43 <alanharnum> gtirloni: one thing I am seeing is that the image is now missing from https://karisma-stories.floeproject.org/storyView.html?id=6057f830-594a-11e8-97bb-4794f8ada9a4 - can we make sure that things in the /upload directory of the deployed app are persisted between restarts?
2018-05-17T13:02:06 <gtirloni> it\'s persisted but i only enabled it a few minutes ago
2018-05-17T13:02:13 <alanharnum> ah ok, gotcha
2018-05-17T13:02:44 <alanharnum> since I only just pushed up the volume link change that I made last night and forgot to push, understandable :p

2018-05-17T13:07:40 <gtirloni> alanharnum: https://github.com/inclusive-design/ci-service/pull/32
2018-05-17T13:07:58 <gtirloni> the build will wait for the /stories endpoint to be ready, but the website will probably be up before it ends
2018-05-17T13:11:36 <alanharnum> gtirloni: this is great, thanks - if we can just test the authed functions I think we are all good to go
2018-05-17T13:12:29 <gtirloni> ok, let me just redeploy it a last time

2018-05-17T13:38:56 <gtirloni> alanharnum: btw, "midnight" is UTC\'s midnight.. which is 8pm Toronto.. I guess I should make that 4am UTC then. Thgouths?
2018-05-17T13:39:23 <gtirloni> it doesn\'t accept a timezone.. so we\'d have to change the server\'s timezone (/me cries)
2018-05-17T13:41:45 <alanharnum> gtirloni: it\'s fine as long as it happens once a day
2018-05-17T13:41:51 <gtirloni> ok
