2018-02-21T16:48:16 <stegru> oh jhernandez I was just about to make a push to that branch, is it not too late?
2018-02-21T16:48:26 <jhernandez> stegru: sure
2018-02-21T16:48:29 <jhernandez> no problem
2018-02-21T16:49:01 <jhernandez> I\'ve been updating universal, windows and checking that tests are still passing and that it doesn\'t "explode"
2018-02-21T16:49:35 <jhernandez> where are you going to push to? windows or gpii-app?
2018-02-21T16:49:55 <jhernandez> or maybe both?
2018-02-21T16:50:00 <stegru> I was about to say just a small one for gpii-app
2018-02-21T16:50:40 <jhernandez> ok ok
2018-02-21T16:51:44 <stegru> yes just gpii-app - I had something outstanding for windows, but that\'s just crap
2018-02-21T16:52:05 <jhernandez> okay, just let me know when you are done so I can pull again and re-build
2018-02-21T16:52:09 <stegru> done
2018-02-21T16:52:21 <jhernandez> hah
2018-02-21T16:52:26 <jhernandez> okay
2018-02-21T16:52:39 <stegru> the comment was longer than the fix ;)
2018-02-21T16:54:38 <jhernandez> heh
2018-02-21T16:54:44 <jhernandez> okay, it\'s already in
2018-02-21T16:54:59 <jhernandez> ;)

2018-02-21T18:21:58 <jhernandez> stegru: I\'m testing it right now, and when I\'m keyed in, I click on shutdown/reboot and it doesn\'t key-out
2018-02-21T18:22:45 <jhernandez> I ran the gpii by calling electron directly (not through npm as you said in your pull request)
2018-02-21T18:23:07 <jhernandez> is that a "proper" test, or am I missing anything?
2018-02-21T18:24:05 <jhernandez> ok, wait, trying again
2018-02-21T18:27:00 * michelled joined the channel
2018-02-21T18:30:11 <jhernandez> no
2018-02-21T18:30:24 <jhernandez> still not working
2018-02-21T18:35:28 <stegru> oh well
2018-02-21T18:35:57 <stegru> jhernandez: i\'ve been running it via gpii-app (with the app directory symlinked to /vagrant)
2018-02-21T18:37:17 <stegru> also, have a look in the log.. it should say something like "shutdown detected"
2018-02-21T18:38:01 <stegru> oh, and i was testing with "sign out", not shutdown/reboot - I thought it did the same
2018-02-21T18:38:49 <stegru> just checked - reboot works for me
2018-02-21T18:38:54 <jhernandez> yeah, I\'ve tested it by running your script and it worked - trying with the sign out now
2018-02-21T18:39:40 <stegru> sorry to leave you with a turd, but i have to go out for a bit
2018-02-21T18:39:56 <jhernandez> no problem
2018-02-21T18:40:19 <jhernandez> just confirmed, it doesn\'t work with "sign out" either
2018-02-21T18:40:30 <stegru> :(
2018-02-21T18:40:42 <jhernandez> I\'ll build an installer anyway and check whether it behaves differently
2018-02-21T18:40:52 <jhernandez> I\'ll let you know
2018-02-21T18:40:54 <jhernandez> ;)

2018-02-21T19:20:45 <jhernandez> all them worked perfectly
2018-02-21T19:21:10 <jhernandez> yay!!

2018-02-21T19:57:41 <stegru> well done, jhernandez - it took me a while to realise it doesn\'t work via npm (I thought i was doing it wrong)

2018-02-21T20:17:26 <jhernandez> well, I tried first with npm and after seeing that it didn\'t work, I remembered your comment about npm
2018-02-21T20:17:28 <jhernandez> :)
2018-02-21T20:18:49 <jhernandez> but yeah, I can\'t get it working via electron, not sure why
2018-02-21T20:19:04 <jhernandez> we\'re lucky that, at least, it works when installed
2018-02-21T20:19:11 <jhernandez> stegru: ^
2018-02-21T20:19:59 * simonjb joined the channel
2018-02-21T20:20:39 <stegru> I don\'t know why, but the process just dies instantly when ran that way, jhernandez
2018-02-21T20:22:14 <jhernandez> yeah, that\'s weird
2018-02-21T20:22:28 <jhernandez> I guess that we have a process-related issue here
2018-02-21T20:22:40 <jhernandez> dunno
2018-02-21T20:23:09 <jhernandez> well, heading the kitchen
