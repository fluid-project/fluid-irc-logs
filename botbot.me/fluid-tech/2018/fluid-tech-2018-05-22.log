2018-05-22T14:47:04 <Justin_o> gtirloni: looks like the build of master failed
2018-05-22T14:47:09 <Justin_o> https://ci.fluidproject.org/blue/organizations/jenkins/infusion-tests/detail/infusion-tests/165/pipeline
2018-05-22T14:47:45 <gtirloni> Justin_o: hi, checking
2018-05-22T14:47:55 <Justin_o> thanks
2018-05-22T14:48:20 <Justin_o> i'm assuming it's related to the PR i just merged, but not sure why the buildkite pipeline would affect jenkins
2018-05-22T14:53:52 <gtirloni> oh no, it's a left over change from INFRA-165.. this will be gone in a few weeks (when it's not deployed by copying files anymore and uses containers). I just fixed and it's running a new job. Sorry about that
2018-05-22T14:58:40 <Justin_o> gtirloni: ah okay, so no changes are needed to infusion then
