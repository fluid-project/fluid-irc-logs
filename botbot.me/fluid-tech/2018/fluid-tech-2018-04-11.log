2018-04-11T20:22:36 <Justin_o> avtar: i'm trying to upload something to cache fly and it keeps timing out.. any ideas?
2018-04-11T20:23:09 <Justin_o> avtar: things look okay here https://cloudharmony.com/status-of-dns-and-compute-and-storage-and-cdn-for-cachefly
2018-04-11T20:23:17 <Justin_o> but maybe that's not the correct place to look
2018-04-11T20:23:53 <avtar> Justin_o: yeah that doesn't look like an official status page
2018-04-11T20:24:23 <avtar> i'm assuming the best thing to do would be to open a ticket
2018-04-11T20:24:36 <avtar> but i wouldn't rule out ocad network issues though
2018-04-11T20:25:36 <avtar> yesterday gio had to reach out to the university network admins because git clones in the data centre were hanging
2018-04-11T20:26:23 <Justin_o> avtar: interestingly it looks like it may have actually uploaded and maybe the response is failing.. i'm going to see if i can access the upload

2018-04-11T13:05:31 <Justin_o> gtirloni: hello
2018-04-11T13:05:37 <gtirloni> hi
2018-04-11T13:06:20 <Justin_o> gtirloni: just read your e-mail about the FLUID-6266 PR
2018-04-11T13:06:32 <Justin_o> what do they think is wrong on GitHub\'s end
2018-04-11T13:07:48 <gtirloni> they said there isn\'t visibility of GH issues on their side either, so it\'s just a suspicion
2018-04-11T13:08:30 <gtirloni> they\'re not sure
2018-04-11T13:08:31 <Justin_o> :(
2018-04-11T13:09:10 <gtirloni> just asked us to report back again if this continues to happen with other PRs. they initially thought about protected branches because they\'ve apparently seen some wonky business from github
2018-04-11T13:10:58 <Justin_o> hmm.. okay
2018-04-11T13:12:32 <Justin_o> i double checked and we aren\'t using protected branches.. although in the future we may want to, to prevent deleting the master branch, or making checks required, like the CLA check
2018-04-11T13:13:43 * cindyli joined the channel
2018-04-11T13:13:47 <gtirloni> i just made an empty commit, squashed it with the previous commit and forcefully pushed.. hopefully that fixes the status (like it did that other time): https://buildkite.com/fluid-project/fluid-infusion/builds/182
2018-04-11T13:13:55 <gtirloni> yeah, protected branches sound good
2018-04-11T13:15:19 <Justin_o> :hand_with_index_and_middle_fingers_crossed:
2018-04-11T13:16:05 <gtirloni> haha :)
2018-04-11T13:16:36 <Justin_o> uh oh
2018-04-11T13:16:58 <gtirloni> ha, this kind of thing is what makes me want to live in a farm
2018-04-11T13:17:02 <Justin_o> lol
2018-04-11T13:17:05 <gtirloni> let\'s try again
2018-04-11T13:17:13 * kasparnet has quit
2018-04-11T13:17:42 <Justin_o> I\'ve been contemplating moving out to a cave somewhere
2018-04-11T13:18:13 * kasparnet joined the channel
2018-04-11T13:18:18 <gtirloni> from the look of the caves i\'ve visited, not a bad idea :)
2018-04-11T13:18:59 <gtirloni> failure was in Fedora\'s web services that redirects the package manager to the proper mirror... it does happen sometimes (i used it just a few minutes ago and it was fine, *fingers crossed*)

2018-04-11T13:40:27 <Justin_o> gtirloni: any chance that there\'s something in the buildkite def that\'s messing things up?
2018-04-11T13:41:11 <Justin_o> gtirloni: for example something with the cleanup?
2018-04-11T13:41:35 <Justin_o> gtirloni: or maybe the wait
2018-04-11T13:44:16 <gtirloni> hmm not sure, I\'ll run some tests in a parallel branch here

2018-04-11T18:52:17 <sgithens> Bosmon or anyone: is it possible to have asyncronous expanders?  Like if an expander function could return a promise instead of the value

2018-04-11T19:09:39 <gmoss> sgithens: I\'m still pretty new to Infusion, but iirc expanders are evaluated at construction time (and only once), so I\'m thinking that as long as whatever key you\'ve got your expander at can "receive" a promise, it should work? I would certainly wait for confirmation from Bosmon or anyone else :)
2018-04-11T19:10:03 <gmoss> I.e. as long as whatever you\'ve putting the result of the function call into can make meaningful use of said promise, it stands to reason that it would be okay
2018-04-11T19:10:08 <gmoss> is my best guess
2018-04-11T19:10:40 <sgithens> gmoss: I guess it would just have to read from the value key in it
2018-04-11T19:11:24 <sgithens> but it would be cool if there was a baked in way to have the value resolve to it
2018-04-11T19:12:00 <sgithens> since I know the construction process has behaviors to wait for certain things to be finished constructing and stuff
2018-04-11T19:16:28 <gmoss> sgithens: hmm.. would it be too awkward to have the expander return a function that returns a promise? or similarly a funcName? without having seen your application, I wonder if this makes sense
2018-04-11T19:17:04 <gmoss> apologies if I\'m only muddying the waters haha
2018-04-11T19:18:15 <gmoss> I suppose what you really want is the final result, whenever it resolves
