2018-06-22T19:24:20 <gmoss> clown: not sure if you found this page: https://about.gitlab.com/comparison/gitlab-vs-jenkins.html
2018-06-22T19:24:20 <gmoss> obviously it\'ll be biased, but I thought it would still be of interest to you. also mentions Docker and K8S support a few times
2018-06-22T19:25:05 <clown> thanks gmoss.  hey the-t-in-rtf, did you know about the above ^
2018-06-22T19:27:13 <clown> gmoss, this line is the core of the issue:  "The job results are displayed on merge requests for easy access", since GPII does a branch+pullrequest
2018-06-22T19:28:24 <clown> still, an interesting read.
2018-06-22T19:28:41 <gmoss> indeed! they have comparisons to various other projects/tools as well

2018-06-22T19:31:39 <clown> gmoss:  if you want to read the-t-in-rtf\'s email, its here: https://lists.gpii.net/pipermail/architecture/2018-June/004803.html
2018-06-22T19:31:58 <clown> I\'m assuming you don\'t subscribe to the gpii-architecture list; perhaps a bad assumption.
2018-06-22T19:32:15 <gmoss> clown: thanks! that\'s a correct assumption, I am not subscribed to that list
2018-06-22T19:33:12 <clown> happy reading, gmoss!
2018-06-22T19:34:58 <gmoss> :)

2018-06-22T20:15:58 <the-t-in-rtf> @clown, I will look at it, but I am honestly looking at other cloud-based solutions first.
