2018-03-15T18:17:44 <agdhruv> Hey guys! I was thinking of some future prospects of the "Build a service for adaptive content and learning supports" project for GSoC.
2018-03-15T18:18:03 <alanharnum> agdhruv: cool, what are your thoughts?
2018-03-15T18:18:18 <agdhruv> What do you think about some work that could be done after the project as described on the ideas page is complete?
2018-03-15T18:18:57 <agdhruv> I think the biggest job once completing it would be to get devs to use it. No point of the API if no one uses it, right?
2018-03-15T18:19:28 <agdhruv> But, is there a separate marketing department in IDI that will take care of this?
2018-03-15T18:20:42 <alanharnum> agdhruv: I\'d provisionally agree, but since we\'re a research-oriented organization, that\'s not necessarily the case for our purposes - sometimes we build things so we\'ve got living artifacts to talk about or demonstrate to the world, etc
2018-03-15T18:20:59 <alanharnum> but it would be good if this eventually evolved into something that could be widely used, I agree
2018-03-15T18:22:04 <agdhruv> Fair enough. In that case, we have the freedom to do things with NLP and so on that we could think of implementing in the future? What do you think about that?
2018-03-15T18:22:10 <alanharnum> totally!
2018-03-15T18:22:31 <alanharnum> I\'d love to see some NLP-related things done, even experimentally
2018-03-15T18:23:04 <alanharnum> the main technical artifact I\'m hoping to have produced at the end of this (three months of coding is a short amount of time) is something we can build on in the future and use as a demonstration example
2018-03-15T18:23:38 <alanharnum> so well-documented code that has the flexibility to add further services or providers of existing services in the future
2018-03-15T18:23:59 <agdhruv> Okay, that helps
2018-03-15T18:24:02 <alanharnum> something like text simplification using NLP would be potentially very valuable, FE
2018-03-15T18:24:37 <alanharnum> I\'ve got the dictionary and translation examples in there because they\'re fairly well-known and common supports with a reasonable amount of libraries and services, etc
2018-03-15T18:24:43 <agdhruv> Yes, but I don\'t think I am competent enough to work on that during this summer, so I\'d rather include that in my future plans. Sounds okay?
2018-03-15T18:25:00 <alanharnum> sounds good - I\'m glad to see thinking about the future beyond GSoC.
2018-03-15T18:25:17 <agdhruv> Great
2018-03-15T18:25:44 <agdhruv> One last question. Will we have a team of accepted students working on this project or just one accepted student?
2018-03-15T18:26:20 <alanharnum> agdhruv: that\'s one of the things the mentors will need to decide based on the number and quality of proposals we get
2018-03-15T18:26:53 <alanharnum> to some extent that\'s out of our hands - we ask for a certain number of slots from Google during our formal review period (after the 27th), and they tell us whether or not we can have that many or not
2018-03-15T18:27:07 <alanharnum> (I believe that\'s how it works)
2018-03-15T18:28:06 <agdhruv> Okay great! I just wanted to know if there is a possibility of there being a team (I\'d love it that way), because then I would be mould my proposal sliiiightly differently
2018-03-15T18:28:22 <agdhruv> There clearly is some possibility, so I got my answer there
2018-03-15T18:29:25 <alanharnum> I believe that per Google\'s rules, even if we accept multiple students for a project, they can\'t submit formally as a team, etc
2018-03-15T18:29:50 <agdhruv> Oh, okay
2018-03-15T18:29:53 <alanharnum> but there\'s nothing to disallow students working together and sharing ideas, etc
2018-03-15T18:30:08 <alanharnum> so I\'d submit your proposal assuming you\'d be working as an individual
2018-03-15T18:30:26 <agdhruv> Yup, that. Thank you so much for your time alanharnum :)
2018-03-15T18:30:31 <alanharnum> (in the GSoC context) - obviously since you\'d be working in an open manner, there\'s lots of possibilities for collaboration, etc
2018-03-15T18:30:44 <alanharnum> you\'re welcome agdhruv
