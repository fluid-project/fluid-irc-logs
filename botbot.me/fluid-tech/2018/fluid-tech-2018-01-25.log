2018-01-25T12:37:47 <the-t-in-rtf> @amatas or anyone, is there any caching built into chocolatey that we can use with Vagrant locally?
2018-01-25T12:38:16 <the-t-in-rtf> I\'m doing a lot of the same installs on a bunch of VMs (testing npm@5.6.0 with various packages), and I\'m noticing that each seems to download every package.
2018-01-25T12:48:51 <the-t-in-rtf> For example, my previous company had a maven proxy in each office to ensure that if we were downloading the same deps over and over, we at least were only paying for the external bandwidth once.
2018-01-25T12:50:49 <the-t-in-rtf> I was just thinking of setting up squid locally as a test, but wanted to ask if anyone had looked into this.

2018-01-25T13:01:26 <amatas_> hi the-t-in-rtf, AFAIK we don\'t have any cache for chocolatey anywhere
2018-01-25T13:03:43 <amatas_> and I don\'t know if the extra bandwidth is a problem for the team. At least for me I don\'t have to pay extra money for the data downloaded.
2018-01-25T13:05:09 <amatas_> I know some solutions based on nginx, which I used in my previous company to have a local "mirror on demand" of linux packages, only to save some time every time that we have to rebuild some local Linux distributions

2018-01-25T14:05:26 <the-t-in-rtf> It\'s more the time that I\'m concerned with, my connection was having problems earlier.
2018-01-25T14:05:48 <the-t-in-rtf> I\'ll try out squid, since I\'ll be reprovisioning a lot of the same packages in a dozen vms.
