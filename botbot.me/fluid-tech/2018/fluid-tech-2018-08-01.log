2018-08-01T17:09:08 <alanharnum> Bosmon: thank you for those comments on KETTLE-66 - I've refactored based on that feedback and done a few small additional things in light of the desire to make things easy for implementors. Please have a look when you have a chance: https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/pull/41
