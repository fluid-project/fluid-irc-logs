2016-01-11T15:36:37 <the-t-in-rtf> It has been far too long, is there a simple fluid utility to resolve a namespaced string to an actual variable or function, i.e. "my.namespaced.component.model.count"?
2016-01-11T15:36:40 <the-t-in-rtf> @Bosmon
2016-01-11T15:37:32 <the-t-in-rtf> I need it to create a function that will allow the test browser to inspect and return namespaced bits from within its browser environment
2016-01-11T15:41:09 <the-t-in-rtf> Looks like fluid.getGlobalValue(path)
2016-01-11T15:41:12 <the-t-in-rtf> is what I need.
2016-01-11T15:42:43 <the-t-in-rtf> I don\'t see any warnings in the comments, I will assume this is at least OK to use in these kinds of tests.
2016-01-11T15:49:14 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - this is a public API
2016-01-11T15:49:15 <Bosmon> http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/CoreAPI.html#fluid-getglobalvalue-path-
2016-01-11T15:49:22 <Bosmon> Our copious docs are your friend :)
2016-01-11T15:50:10 <the-t-in-rtf> Ah, usually the code also has comments to the opposite effect, as in "don\'t use this dummy"
2016-01-11T15:50:26 <the-t-in-rtf> I checked the new docs before posting the question.
2016-01-11T15:50:37 <the-t-in-rtf> and thus found the answer
2016-01-11T15:51:10 <the-t-in-rtf> I suppose I missed the fact that the title ("core API") meant that it was blessed for use
2016-01-11T15:55:32 <the-t-in-rtf> I am glad I got back to work before my brain had completely addled
2016-01-11T15:55:44 <the-t-in-rtf> Although I suppose my brain cannot be expected to judge that fairly itself

2016-01-11T16:09:18 <the-t-in-rtf> What is the best practice for calling fluid.module.register?  I assume I should call it from the file that is hit by "require" itself, i.e. the package\'s index.js or equivalent?
2016-01-11T16:09:21 <the-t-in-rtf> @bosmon
2016-01-11T16:18:13 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - that\'s right, yes
