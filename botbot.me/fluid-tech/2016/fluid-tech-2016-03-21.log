b"2016-03-21T21:16:09 <jguo> figure out what kinds of interactions are expected from users
2016-03-21T21:16:24 <jguo> if there's a general theme, design controls for those first
2016-03-21T21:17:16 <jguo> (for example, if all systems looked at have a duration parameter, then a duration control is a good idea)
2016-03-21T21:18:24 <simonjb> ok, and to actually build the controls, how would you start?
2016-03-21T21:18:53 <simonjb> do you have favorite tools or libraries?
2016-03-21T21:19:19 <jguo> oh, jQuery
2016-03-21T21:20:04 <jguo> are you guys ok with the MVC approach?
2016-03-21T21:21:15 <simonjb> can you expand on the MVC approach and how it would apply here?
2016-03-21T21:21:32 <jguo> also Polymer, I think would be a good idea
2016-03-21T21:24:47 <jguo> well, the user would manipulate a particular control which would ping the model which then would update the view to what the user would expect after the interation
2016-03-21T21:26:23 <jguo> key strokes would be the easiest to follow, but tracking mouse/finger position isn't that much more difficult

2016-03-21T21:29:27 <simonjb> have you looked at Infusion at all yet?
2016-03-21T21:31:43 <jguo> lol, I was actually looking at it while chatting with you :)
2016-03-21T21:32:02 <jguo> it's pretty cool!
2016-03-21T21:32:38 <simonjb> it's not absolutely essential to use Infusion but it would be good to
2016-03-21T21:32:52 <simonjb> the reason that I bring it up is that you mentioned MVC
2016-03-21T21:33:37 <simonjb> Infusion has a component system and mechanism for relating models of different components
2016-03-21T21:33:39 <jguo> I really like what I see so far
2016-03-21T21:34:25 <simonjb> while it's not essential to use Infusion, anything developed should work with Infusion
2016-03-21T21:34:32 <jguo> makes sense
2016-03-21T21:34:39 <jguo> I would be happy to learn it
2016-03-21T21:35:11 <jguo> it looks like the documentation is decent, which is very nice
2016-03-21T21:36:42 <jguo> lol, I've decide to get infusion because I really like the keyboard accessibility plugin
2016-03-21T21:42:02 <jguo> alrighty, I have to head out soon
2016-03-21T21:42:11 <jguo> thanks so much for chatting with me!
2016-03-21T21:42:25 <simonjb> jguo: thanks for chatting also and for your interest in our project
2016-03-21T21:42:34 <jguo> Would you mind giving me your email address in case I have more questions?
2016-03-21T21:42:43 <jguo> or can I always find you on IRC?
2016-03-21T21:42:55 <simonjb> jguo: IRC is good
2016-03-21T21:43:20 <simonjb> I'm generally around 10am-6pm Eastern time North America
2016-03-21T21:43:36 <simonjb> but if I'm not around you can talk to others in the fluid channels also
2016-03-21T21:44:14 <jguo> simonjb: alright, thank you very much!

2016-03-21T20:45:30 <jguo> Hello!
2016-03-21T20:45:38 <jguo> \tI was hoping to talk to Simon Bates about the project on Accessible, Responsive Music UI Controls
2016-03-21T20:47:30 <simonjb> hey there jguo
2016-03-21T20:47:38 <jguo> hi!
2016-03-21T20:47:49 <jguo> sorry about spamming two channels
2016-03-21T20:47:55 <jguo> I realized that is one is a lot smaller
2016-03-21T20:48:12 <simonjb> no problem
2016-03-21T20:48:36 <jguo> are you still looking for applicants for your accessible, responsive music UI controls project?
2016-03-21T20:48:43 <jguo> (also, thanks for responding so fast!)
2016-03-21T20:49:36 <jguo> I'm a classically trained pianist and your project sounds like a really good fit for me
2016-03-21T20:49:37 <simonjb> yes, we are, I think the deadline for proposals is the end of this week
2016-03-21T20:49:47 <jguo> oh, awesome@
2016-03-21T20:49:49 <jguo> !
2016-03-21T20:50:11 <jguo> I was looking for some kind of tasks list
2016-03-21T20:50:50 <jguo> or template for applying, but can't seem to find one
2016-03-21T20:51:24 <simonjb> the detail that we have on the project is on this wiki page: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Google+Summer+of+Code+2016+with+the+Fluid+Project
2016-03-21T20:51:55 <simonjb> we don't have a more detailed break down
2016-03-21T20:52:18 <jguo> ah, I see
2016-03-21T20:52:29 <jguo> So I should just follow the general links at the bottom of the page?
2016-03-21T20:52:58 <simonjb> which links?
2016-03-21T20:52:58 * jguo has quit
2016-03-21T20:53:43 * jguo joined the channel
2016-03-21T20:54:29 <simonjb> hey jguo, are you back?
2016-03-21T20:54:43 <jguo> yup!
2016-03-21T20:54:45 <jguo> sorry about that
2016-03-21T20:54:47 <jguo> connection got reset
2016-03-21T20:54:56 <simonjb> no problem, it happens :)
2016-03-21T20:55:01 <jguo> :)
2016-03-21T20:55:11 <simonjb> which links are you referring to?
2016-03-21T20:55:15 <jguo> I was in the middle of typing something pretty long too, haha
2016-03-21T20:55:19 <simonjb> :(
2016-03-21T20:55:28 <jguo> I'll just retype it, haha
2016-03-21T20:55:58 <jguo> so, I was wondering if you might have more details
2016-03-21T20:56:02 <jguo> about what you guys are looking for
2016-03-21T20:56:10 <jguo> the GSoC application asks for a timeline
2016-03-21T20:56:39 <jguo> and I was hoping for some more details
2016-03-21T20:57:01 <jguo> I actually worked on a few interactive music projects
2016-03-21T20:57:29 * clown has left the channel
2016-03-21T20:57:50 <simonjb> cool, what have you done?
2016-03-21T20:58:18 <jguo> I also taught people with disabilities using music
2016-03-21T20:58:20 <jguo> ah, kk
2016-03-21T20:58:53 <jguo> I worked on a project that tracked people through a space
2016-03-21T20:59:02 <jguo> and created harmonies as they walked through the space
2016-03-21T20:59:32 <simonjb> sounds very cool, what technologies did you use?
2016-03-21T20:59:58 <jguo> I also wrote a bunch of stuff in Pure Data
2016-03-21T21:00:20 <simonjb> yeah, pd is neat
2016-03-21T21:00:24 <jguo> yeah, it's great!
2016-03-21T21:00:44 <jguo> I have to admit though, aside from PD, most of this stuff was 4+ years ago
2016-03-21T21:01:00 <jguo> I'm trying to remember the libraries I used off the top of my head
2016-03-21T21:01:26 <simonjb> do you have experience with javascript and web technologies?
2016-03-21T21:01:34 * the-t-in-rtf has quit
2016-03-21T21:01:37 <jguo> yes
2016-03-21T21:01:56 <jguo> html/css I'm pretty darn comfortable with
2016-03-21T21:02:09 <jguo> js sometimes requires a bit of googling for the more complex stuff
2016-03-21T21:02:59 <jguo> I used php at one point
2016-03-21T21:03:35 <jguo> to read in files that printed out notes for me (before I discovered finale and other free music notation services)
2016-03-21T21:04:07 <simonjb> how might you start to create a music control such as we are looking for for this project?
2016-03-21T21:04:55 <jguo> I was actually hoping to first get a better idea of exactly what you're looking for
2016-03-21T21:05:02 <jguo> do you want something more along the lines of pd?
2016-03-21T21:05:16 <jguo> but less coding-esque
2016-03-21T21:05:27 <jguo> or do you want something that can create harmonies on the fly?
2016-03-21T21:05:35 <jguo> (which you can get PD to do)
2016-03-21T21:06:13 <jguo> I'm assuming you want to be able to record things?
2016-03-21T21:06:22 <simonjb> for this project, we're interested in new controls for controlling music, rather than a synthesis or programming system
2016-03-21T21:06:29 <jguo> ahh, I see
2016-03-21T21:06:32 <simonjb> that is, the UI elements
2016-03-21T21:06:40 <jguo> ok
2016-03-21T21:07:09 <jguo> I'm assuming then both mouse and touch capable?
2016-03-21T21:07:10 <simonjb> to integrate with existing synthesis software for the web
2016-03-21T21:07:19 <jguo> ah, got it
2016-03-21T21:07:28 <simonjb> and keyboard
2016-03-21T21:07:40 <jguo> have you any particular synthesis software in mind?
2016-03-21T21:07:50 <simonjb> inclusive design is very important for this project
2016-03-21T21:08:18 <jguo> ok, cool, I have a better idea, thanks :)
2016-03-21T21:08:36 <simonjb> Flocking would be a good example
2016-03-21T21:08:45 <simonjb> http://flockingjs.org/
2016-03-21T21:09:48 <jguo> ah, cool!
2016-03-21T21:09:58 <jguo> so instead of all that code
2016-03-21T21:10:06 <jguo> you could replace it with knobs and the like
2016-03-21T21:10:37 <jguo> well, to go back to your initial question
2016-03-21T21:11:40 <jguo> sorry, got a little distracted by flockingjs
2016-03-21T21:12:09 <simonjb> np, it's pretty cool
2016-03-21T21:12:16 <jguo> it really is!
2016-03-21T21:12:25 <jguo> now I just wanna play with it
2016-03-21T21:12:34 <jguo> ok
2016-03-21T21:12:36 <jguo> I'm back
2016-03-21T21:12:50 <jguo> so, for a control system
2016-03-21T21:13:47 <jguo> I think I would have knobs for duration, because that can go as long as the user wants
2016-03-21T21:14:13 <jguo> oh wait
2016-03-21T21:14:20 <jguo> did you want to have a more general outline?
2016-03-21T21:15:14 <jguo> I would check to see what controls/parameters are needed
2016-03-21T21:15:22 <simonjb> yeah, more general is good -- just wanting to get a sense you how you might start on this project
2016-03-21T21:15:27 <jguo> ah, got it
2016-03-21T21:15:51 <jguo> right, I'd like to get familiar with the system(s) that the project would like to interface with
