2016-05-23T13:41:46 <the-t-in-rtf> I am having trouble running a test using fluid.test.runTests("environment.name")
2016-05-23T13:42:09 <the-t-in-rtf> Even though they pass if I run the individual file, If I require the tests from another file, I get "assertion outside test context" for all the tests.

2016-05-23T13:43:48 <the-t-in-rtf> Here\'s an example of a test file that runs successfully on its own:  https://github.com/the-t-in-rtf/gpii-express/blob/GPII-1800/tests/js/querystring/querystring-coding-tests.js
2016-05-23T13:44:19 <the-t-in-rtf> I am trying to add it to my "rollup" test file that\'s called when "npm test" is run.
2016-05-23T13:59:48 <the-t-in-rtf> I was able to determine that I had an unnecessary call to "fluid.loadTestingSupport" in one of the files
2016-05-23T14:00:04 <the-t-in-rtf> Commenting that out avoids the problem.  I have left a TODO there for @Bosmon and I to review.
