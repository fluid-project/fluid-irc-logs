2016-05-09T14:53:02 <Bosmon> Hey there cindyli - thanks so much for CLOSING INACTIVE THINGS
2016-05-09T14:53:07 <Bosmon> It\'s a hugely invaluable service :)

2016-05-09T15:03:45 <Bosmon> cindyli - you\'ve probably got a great rush on your final day
2016-05-09T15:03:59 <Bosmon> But in case you had a small gap, I wondered if you might take an eye at this pull - https://github.com/fluid-project/jshint/pull/1
2016-05-09T15:04:37 <Bosmon> It makes some improvements that would be useful in our linting - for example, the ability to add extra annotation on a line saying // jshint:ignore in order to explain what it is for

2016-05-09T17:31:05 <wannabeCitizen> avtar, colinclark: Is it possible to get a dev environment ready for my project in the next week or 2?
2016-05-09T17:31:27 <colinclark> wannabeCitizen: Tell me a bit more about what kind of a setup you need?
2016-05-09T17:31:34 <colinclark> What will your project do, and what will it depend on?
2016-05-09T17:31:35 <wannabeCitizen> Not sure if you guys have standard vagrant images you start from or if you pass around the fluid dev specs in a docker container
2016-05-09T17:31:38 <colinclark> the answer, I\'m sure, is yes :)
2016-05-09T17:31:57 <colinclark> we do have some standard vagrant tools to help get you set up
2016-05-09T17:32:07 <colinclark> but again, it depends specifically on, well, what you depend on
2016-05-09T17:32:12 <wannabeCitizen> Well that\xe2\x80\x99s not defined fully yet and will be developing over the next 2 weeks w/ Bosmon
2016-05-09T17:32:48 <wannabeCitizen> However, it\xe2\x80\x99ll need to be able to handle decently high bandwidth since I plan to do a lot of data pipelining into the machine
2016-05-09T17:32:58 <wannabeCitizen> However, it\xe2\x80\x99ll mostly be set up as a web app dev box
2016-05-09T17:33:08 <wannabeCitizen> So NGINX would be nice as a gateway
2016-05-09T17:33:28 <colinclark> but what will it run? :)
2016-05-09T17:33:30 <wannabeCitizen> Then I\xe2\x80\x99ll probably use node or python servers to act as proxies for my actual services
2016-05-09T17:33:34 <colinclark> ok
2016-05-09T17:33:38 <wannabeCitizen> Probably a node or a tornado server
2016-05-09T17:33:45 <colinclark> we have a base vagrant box for Node services
2016-05-09T17:33:48 <wannabeCitizen> python uvloop is what I may try for this summer
2016-05-09T17:33:53 <wannabeCitizen> okay good to know
2016-05-09T17:34:00 <colinclark> probably nothign for python
2016-05-09T17:34:10 <colinclark> but avtar is sometimes full of surprises
2016-05-09T17:34:27 <wannabeCitizen> If you all haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen this yet, check it out: http://magic.io/blog/uvloop-blazing-fast-python-networking/
2016-05-09T17:35:00 <wannabeCitizen> Apparently the new uvloop library for asyncio in python3 is outperforming Node consistently and is at Go speed for many tasks
2016-05-09T17:35:25 <Bosmon> Obsession with performance is one of the prime computer science diseases :)
2016-05-09T17:35:26 <wannabeCitizen> anyhoo, it sounds like I can start with your vagrant image for Node stuff
2016-05-09T17:35:41 <Bosmon> Making products which actually do something for people, less so : P
2016-05-09T17:35:41 <wannabeCitizen> Maybe will make a similar image for any python stuff
2016-05-09T17:36:06 <wannabeCitizen> Well, unfortunately with data stuff, and minimal patience, sometimes usability and performance are tied together
2016-05-09T17:36:18 <avtar> wannabeCitizen: we don\'t have a python setup at the moment, just a fairly well tested one for node and a lamp one at some point in the near future
2016-05-09T17:36:36 <Bosmon> Well I\'ve heard that argument used a lot :)
2016-05-09T17:36:47 <wannabeCitizen> cool, avtar: is the node vagrant script somewhere in the github?
2016-05-09T17:37:02 <avtar> wannabeCitizen: what would be the benefits of using nginx as a reverse proxy in your dev setup?
2016-05-09T17:37:04 <Bosmon> But mostly as a means for computer scientists to tie "usability" to something which gives them an excuse not to have to deal with either design, or human beings
2016-05-09T17:37:12 <wannabeCitizen> hahaha
2016-05-09T17:37:18 <wannabeCitizen> well we\xe2\x80\x99re interested in human beings
2016-05-09T17:37:26 <Bosmon> I hope we are :)
2016-05-09T17:37:28 <wannabeCitizen> but still don\xe2\x80\x99t want to spend half of my summer waiting for tests to finish
2016-05-09T17:39:04 <wannabeCitizen> I just personally like python better for backend infrastructure than JS
2016-05-09T17:39:27 <Bosmon> Yes
2016-05-09T17:39:47 <Bosmon> I think we\'ll want to see you develop as much of your stuff in JS as possible, in the interests of being able to maintain it after you are gone
2016-05-09T17:39:56 <wannabeCitizen> ah yes
2016-05-09T17:40:14 <Bosmon> python is cool, to be sure
2016-05-09T17:40:23 <wannabeCitizen> I suppose it depends on how far things get. If the project mostly finishes, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to maintain it some
2016-05-09T17:41:00 <wannabeCitizen> but we\xe2\x80\x99ll see
2016-05-09T17:41:19 <wannabeCitizen> If it integrates into one of your other projects then yeah, best to be all node I\xe2\x80\x99m guessing
2016-05-09T17:41:35 <Bosmon> Time for maintenance is always something that is scarcer in the past than the future :)
2016-05-09T17:41:50 * simonjb has quit
2016-05-09T17:42:22 <wannabeCitizen> What about dbs? Does the team have a strong opinion about what db is ideal for underneath web apps?
2016-05-09T17:42:32 * cindyli joined the channel
2016-05-09T17:42:33 <Bosmon> No particularly strong opinion
2016-05-09T17:42:39 <Bosmon> We\'ve worked with CouchDB a moderate amount
2016-05-09T17:42:59 <Bosmon> We (I) are quite interested in exploring graph databases
2016-05-09T17:43:05 <Bosmon> With which we have no experience
2016-05-09T17:43:37 <Bosmon> Both Neo4j and OrientDB look interesting
2016-05-09T17:44:49 <Bosmon> Shame that they\'re Java
2016-05-09T17:44:51 <Bosmon> But what can you do
2016-05-09T17:45:00 <wannabeCitizen> yeah that\xe2\x80\x99s why I don\xe2\x80\x99t like neo4j
2016-05-09T17:45:06 <wannabeCitizen> I really like RethinkDB right now
2016-05-09T17:45:15 <wannabeCitizen> But I have plenty of experience with SQL and MongoDB too
2016-05-09T17:45:20 <wannabeCitizen> I used couch once
2016-05-09T17:45:35 <wannabeCitizen> I also use key/value stores like Redis for smaller things like sessions
2016-05-09T17:47:30 <Bosmon> gtirloni - was it InfluxDB you were interested in for storing logs and other time series?
2016-05-09T17:51:47 <gtirloni> Bosmon: we\'re using influxdb to store metrics mostly (time+counters). we were looking at elasticsearch for logs and other textual content

2016-05-09T18:14:25 <avtar> wannabeCitizen: regarding https://botbot.me/freenode/fluid-tech/2016-05-09/?msg=65736295&page=1
2016-05-09T18:14:30 <avtar> this is the best place to start https://github.com/GPII/qi-development-environments/tree/master/nodejs
2016-05-09T18:15:00 <avtar> we use config management (ansible) to do most of the heavy lifting https://github.com/idi-ops/ansible-nodejs
2016-05-09T18:53:39 * the-t-in-rtf joined the channel
2016-05-09T19:19:42 <cindyli> Bosmon: ur pull request for jshint https://github.com/fluid-project/jshint/pull/1/files introduces "mulopwhite:true" that permits whitespace to be lax around multiplicative operators. the example you gave "2*x + 3*y" doesn\'t have whitespace around multiplication sign
2016-05-09T19:19:51 <cindyli> what does it actually dor?
2016-05-09T19:19:55 <cindyli> **do
2016-05-09T19:20:40 <cindyli> i also played with the current jshint, it doesn\'t report any error when with or without whitespaces around *
2016-05-09T19:23:10 <the-t-in-rtf> Hi, @cindyli.  Just to confirm, you have to go no higher than JSHint 2.4.0.  They dropped support for whitespace linting altogether in the next minor revision.
2016-05-09T19:23:46 <the-t-in-rtf> I have heard rumors of people who care about whitespace linting migrating to ESLint, but we have not gone that route.
2016-05-09T19:23:57 * wannabeCitizen has quit
2016-05-09T19:25:23 <cindyli> the-t-in-rtf: ok, i see, i should check what jshint version that infusion uses. i was using that version to play around
2016-05-09T19:25:46 <the-t-in-rtf> 2.4.0
2016-05-09T19:25:52 <cindyli> the-t-in-rtf: the-t-in-rtf: Bosmon has a pull request that forks from jshint to add additional support on some features. one thing is around the white space. you probably wanna take a look if you are interested - https://github.com/fluid-project/jshint/pull/1/files
2016-05-09T19:26:16 <cindyli> the-t-in-rtf: thanks for checking that. cool, my experiment should be valid then :0

2016-05-09T19:32:07 <the-t-in-rtf> I was just looking at ESLint for a bit:  http://eslint.org/docs/rules/
2016-05-09T19:32:26 <the-t-in-rtf> It doesn\'t support anything equivalent to the new syntax, although it does have a plugin API.
