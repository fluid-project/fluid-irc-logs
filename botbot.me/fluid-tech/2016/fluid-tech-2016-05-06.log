2016-05-06T14:33:34 <amatas> Hi Bosmon, here they are the changes I made yesterday: https://github.com/amatas/GPII-universal/tree/GPII-1781/examples/gpii-production-tests . But I'm not able to run the production tests, because it seems that they try to launch kettle twice in the same port.
2016-05-06T14:34:03 <amatas> any tip about what I'm doing wrong?
