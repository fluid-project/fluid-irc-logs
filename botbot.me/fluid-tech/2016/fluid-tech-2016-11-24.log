2016-11-24T22:37:18 <alanharnum> this looks very interesting conceptually: https://zeit.co/blog/next

2016-11-24T22:39:59 <alanharnum> "Since then, however, notable conceptual changes have allowed us to bridge this gap. The most important of which is the introduction of the pure render function that returns the representation of the UI based on the available data at that point in time."
2016-11-24T22:39:59 <alanharnum> "This model (popularized by React) is of significant importance, but that alone is not necessarily different from how most template systems work. The other critical concept is the component lifecycle."
2016-11-24T22:40:00 <alanharnum> "Lifecycle hooks allow us to handle the continuation of some rendering that originated on the server. You can start with a static representation of data, subscribe to realtime updates from a server, and change it over time, for example. Or perhaps it just remains static."
