2016-08-19T13:37:47 <colinclark> cindyli: I think the-t-in-rtf doesn't work on Fridays
2016-08-19T13:38:02 <colinclark> When I pinged him at 6:30 am this morning, he was hanging out with Phil, his son
2016-08-19T13:38:07 <cindyli> ah ha, now i rmb he mentioned it before
2016-08-19T13:38:39 <cindyli> thanks for reminding me, colinclark
2016-08-19T13:38:45 <colinclark> no problem
2016-08-19T13:51:31 <the-t-in-rtf> Hi, Cindy.  By coincidence I am at my computer, but no, I'm not working.
2016-08-19T13:51:52 <the-t-in-rtf> If you have a quick question, post it and maybe I can help.

2016-08-19T14:53:28 <cindyli> hey, the-t-in-rtf, just saw ur msg. thanks for the offer. The good news is I've figured out what the problem is. The issue was pulling in the latest gpii-pouchdb changes breaks acceptance tests 'cuz of the restructuring and renaming of components etc. i've found out those a few places in gpii tests that need to be adjusted to accommodate that. thanks, the-t-in-rtf, go enjoy ur relaxing Fridays :)
2016-08-19T14:59:53 <the-t-in-rtf> glad to hear it.
