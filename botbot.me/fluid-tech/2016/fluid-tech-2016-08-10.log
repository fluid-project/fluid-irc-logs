2016-08-10T15:03:13 <clown> hey avtar, got time for a CI question?
2016-08-10T15:03:32 * the-t-in-rtf joined the channel
2016-08-10T15:13:32 <avtar> clown: sure
2016-08-10T15:16:50 <clown> hi avtar.
2016-08-10T15:17:16 <avtar> howdy
2016-08-10T15:17:24 <clown> Yesterday, the changes I pushed weren't actually tested.
2016-08-10T15:17:27 <clown> If you look at:
2016-08-10T15:17:33 <clown> https://ci.gpii.net/job/windows-unit-tests/23/console
2016-08-10T15:17:48 <clown> It doesn't include the processReporter, nor its unit tests.
2016-08-10T15:18:10 <clown> I looked at the package.json, and it appears to have the correct info.
2016-08-10T15:18:14 <clown> what am I missing
2016-08-10T15:18:15 <clown> ?
2016-08-10T15:21:07 * simonjb has quit
2016-08-10T15:23:06 <avtar> clown: do they run locally if you clone your repo at eb19b311cbb51c6d839780b9b497875110a299d3 into an empty git working directory?
2016-08-10T15:24:18 <clown> Yes, if I set up the vagrant machine locally, with my 442 branch, then the processReporter is built, and the unit tests are run.
2016-08-10T15:25:21 <clown> if it matters, the analogous changes to the linux side did run and pass on CI last week.  (Fri I think).
2016-08-10T15:27:03 <clown> BTW, I pushed some more changes a few minute back, and the CI has started up again.
2016-08-10T15:27:30 * colinclark has quit
2016-08-10T15:29:23 <clown> almost time for standup.

2016-08-10T15:40:59 <amatas> hey avtar!
2016-08-10T15:41:30 <avtar> not sure if you got the email notification about https://ci.gpii.net/job/create-windows-vm/21/console
2016-08-10T15:41:39 <avtar> looks like virtualbox isn't responding again
2016-08-10T15:42:22 <amatas> let me see
2016-08-10T15:42:29 <avtar> thanks
2016-08-10T15:43:04 <amatas> https://ci.gpii.net/job/windows-tests/25/ :(
2016-08-10T15:43:21 <amatas> the only action that comes to my mind is to reboot the host again

2016-08-10T15:55:35 <avtar> amatas: i guess nothing in the logs again? :/
2016-08-10T15:55:54 <amatas> nothing :(
2016-08-10T15:56:21 <amatas> also I've tried to make a snapshot or screenshot, but VBoxManage doesn't list the vm
2016-08-10T15:57:31 * kasparnet joined the channel
2016-08-10T15:57:57 <amatas> o wait, I'm able to get the list as the jenkins user

2016-08-10T16:34:52 <gtirloni> yesterday i reloaded the gpii jobs from scratch and that messed up the fix avtar had found for a previous issue
2016-08-10T16:35:16 <gtirloni> https://github.com/GPII/ci-service/pull/18 -- we need to merge this once h-0005 is back
2016-08-10T16:52:17 * alanharnum has quit
2016-08-10T16:53:16 <amatas> gtirloni, I'll ping you when the reboot is performed
2016-08-10T16:53:22 <gtirloni> thanks
2016-08-10T16:53:47 <gtirloni> sorry about breaking things! i think we're all suffering from enough jenkins PTSD.

2016-08-10T18:25:35 <gtirloni> https://ci.gpii.net/job/windows-unit-tests/24/console <-- looks like what we expect (without a fix to the high contrast stuff)

2016-08-10T18:44:13 <clown> and they passed \\o/
