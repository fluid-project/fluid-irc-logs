2016-12-01T15:25:51 <simonjb> hi colinclark are you available for some flocking-midi questions?
2016-12-01T15:26:02 <colinclark> of course!
2016-12-01T15:26:09 * kasparnet has quit
2016-12-01T15:26:21 <simonjb> awesome, I\'m just looking over the code and wanted to check my understanding
2016-12-01T15:28:00 <colinclark> ok
2016-12-01T15:29:09 <simonjb> it looks to me like we are no longer automatically creating node-midi objects for ports -- we have one for input and one for output in flock.midi.nodejs.access
2016-12-01T15:29:28 <simonjb> is this correct?
2016-12-01T15:31:23 <colinclark> Yes, that\'s correct
2016-12-01T15:31:27 * alanharnum has quit
2016-12-01T15:31:51 <simonjb> and we don\'t yet have a way to create new node-midi objects for ports or open them
2016-12-01T15:31:54 * michelled joined the channel
2016-12-01T15:31:55 <colinclark> And those are used simply to access RtMidi\'s broken requirement to have an instance of a MIDIIn and a MIDIOut to list the connected ports of that type
2016-12-01T15:32:02 <colinclark> we do not yet, correct
2016-12-01T15:32:03 <simonjb> right
2016-12-01T15:32:13 <colinclark> hence my comment yesterday about how slow this has been :)
2016-12-01T15:32:22 <simonjb> awesome, wanted to make sure I wasn\'t missing something
2016-12-01T15:32:37 <colinclark> Nope
2016-12-01T15:32:50 <colinclark> There are some base grades in the -core module
2016-12-01T15:33:10 <colinclark> which are as yet unused and were just my attemp to start moving logic around from the old library
2016-12-01T15:33:32 <simonjb> does it make sense for me to have a go at porting flock.midi.connection?
2016-12-01T15:33:35 <colinclark> yes
2016-12-01T15:33:40 <colinclark> Most definitely
2016-12-01T15:33:42 <colinclark> :)
2016-12-01T15:33:54 <colinclark> So...
2016-12-01T15:34:02 <colinclark> "Here\'s the thing, right?"
2016-12-01T15:34:06 <simonjb> :)
2016-12-01T15:34:51 <colinclark> The most awkward part about the original midi.connection component was this:
2016-12-01T15:34:53 <colinclark> https://github.com/colinbdclark/Flocking/blob/midi-improvements/src/web/midi.js#L435-L440
2016-12-01T15:35:12 * alanharnum joined the channel
2016-12-01T15:35:24 <simonjb> I was thinking for now, initially, I\'d use the port name
2016-12-01T15:35:31 <colinclark> +1 :)
2016-12-01T15:35:40 * stegru has quit
2016-12-01T15:35:57 <simonjb> from the flock.midi.system.model.ports
2016-12-01T15:36:02 <colinclark> There\'s this pretty dreadful pile of functions used to match "port specifications" to actual ports:https://github.com/colinbdclark/Flocking/blob/midi-improvements/src/web/midi.js#L523-L609
2016-12-01T15:36:08 <colinclark> All of that should really go
2016-12-01T15:36:15 <colinclark> so starting just by matching by name seems perfectly reasonable
2016-12-01T15:36:33 <simonjb> cool, yeah, I was thinking of starting minimally and building up
2016-12-01T15:37:02 <colinclark> makes sense to me
2016-12-01T15:37:06 <colinclark> I think it will be great
2016-12-01T15:37:19 <simonjb> awesome, I will start on that now, thanks
2016-12-01T15:37:28 <colinclark> and I guess you\'ll start with Node implementations for Ports, rather than the browser?
2016-12-01T15:37:55 <simonjb> yes, initially I was start with Node
2016-12-01T15:37:58 <colinclark> ok
2016-12-01T15:38:09 <colinclark> I thought, if I get time today and tomorrow, I would try to fill out those missing unit tests for the infrastructure we have
2016-12-01T15:38:27 <colinclark> and then if it\'s helpful I can try to write a port component for the Web MIDI API to go with your node implementation
2016-12-01T15:38:47 <simonjb> that sounds great
2016-12-01T15:39:09 <colinclark> awesome
2016-12-01T15:39:41 <colinclark> I don\'t even know if the "connection" abstraction is the right one
2016-12-01T15:40:09 <colinclark> i.e. a component representing an aggregation of one or ports that can be connected to
2016-12-01T15:40:31 <colinclark> but it did seem about right when I build that midi router
2016-12-01T15:40:39 * stegru joined the channel
2016-12-01T15:40:46 <simonjb> seems reasonable to me to stick with that
2016-12-01T15:40:49 <colinclark> ok
2016-12-01T15:41:45 <simonjb> there will be some things maybe to manage if a connection covers multiple ports and one of them disappears and not all of them
2016-12-01T15:41:54 <colinclark> yes, that\'s right
2016-12-01T15:42:16 <colinclark> While you\'re hacking, simonjb, you can listen to the weather sonified with Flocking: http://www.riadosa.com/
2016-12-01T15:42:54 <simonjb> very nice :)
2016-12-01T15:44:53 <simonjb> colinclark: oh, yesterday morning I spent a little time trying to reproduce my seg fault -- but wasn\'t able to, which is encouraging https://github.com/simonbates/nexus-experiments/blob/master/nodeMidiSegFault.js
2016-12-01T15:45:06 <colinclark> that\'s good news!
2016-12-01T15:45:26 <simonjb> hopefully it was just something dumb that I was doing and we won\'t hit it again :)
2016-12-01T15:45:45 <colinclark> yes, I hope so
