2016-08-11T11:45:14 <kasparnet> morning antwarning Bosmon
2016-08-11T11:51:06 <Bosmon> hi
2016-08-11T11:51:43 <kasparnet> hey bosmon
2016-08-11T11:51:53 <kasparnet> so I was just testing the jaws pull request
2016-08-11T11:51:59 <kasparnet> and realize that we have a case of https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-1223
2016-08-11T11:52:45 <kasparnet> I dont remember if we ever discussed this in details before (I know for sure we\'ve talked about it in passing)
2016-08-11T11:54:34 <kasparnet> Do you remember us having any plans for dealing with this?
2016-08-11T11:55:54 <kasparnet> I guess my only off-the-top-of-my-head solution would be to have each settingshander declare which application settings are supported by it
2016-08-11T11:56:49 <kasparnet> or explicitly key the entries in the NP set with which SH block they belong
2016-08-11T11:56:51 <kasparnet> to*
2016-08-11T12:04:25 * Jess_ joined the channel
2016-08-11T12:08:12 <kasparnet> Bosmon: ^
2016-08-11T12:08:22 <Bosmon> kasparnet - hah, hilarious
2016-08-11T12:08:48 <kasparnet> it\'s tragic! TRAGIC and HORRIFIC, I tell you
2016-08-11T12:08:54 <Bosmon> Yes, I ran into this again when trying to get the journalling system working
2016-08-11T12:09:18 <Bosmon> I\'m not sure how having the settingshandler declare which settings it supports would help
2016-08-11T12:09:25 <Bosmon> But perhaps you\'re just saying the same thing the other way round
2016-08-11T12:09:56 <kasparnet> Bosmon: the same thing as my second "suggestion"?
2016-08-11T12:10:25 <Bosmon> Yes
2016-08-11T12:10:28 <Bosmon> No
2016-08-11T12:10:38 <Bosmon> I mean, your second suggestion makes sense
2016-08-11T12:10:44 <Bosmon> And I\'m not sure the first one does : P
2016-08-11T12:11:17 <Bosmon> I think the whole point of application settings is that they are essentially unbounded
2016-08-11T12:12:16 <kasparnet> well - I guess they\'re somewhat the same, but problem with the second suggestion is that you\'d have to declare it in all preferences set
2016-08-11T12:12:31 <Bosmon> We should fix the solutions registry format so that it is clear which settingshandler a setting is routed to
2016-08-11T12:12:51 <kasparnet> so for ALL users that have jaws settings, they would need to have in their NP set that setting X belongs in settingshandler Y
2016-08-11T12:13:10 <kasparnet> instead of having it in the solution registry that solution X belongs to handler Y
2016-08-11T12:13:21 <Bosmon> ok
2016-08-11T12:13:33 <Bosmon> I guess this would just be more work done by the "matchmaker"
2016-08-11T12:13:40 <kasparnet> yeah
2016-08-11T12:13:59 <Bosmon> And we would just change the "final lifecycle format" to qualify all the settings there
2016-08-11T12:14:17 <kasparnet> yeah, that seems sensible
2016-08-11T12:14:21 <Bosmon> It\'s great that I\'ve worked on this recently and so am slightly less horribly confused about it all
2016-08-11T12:14:51 <kasparnet> hehe
2016-08-11T12:14:55 <kasparnet> yeah
2016-08-11T12:14:56 <Bosmon> How does the issue manifest itself with the JAWS pull request?
2016-08-11T12:15:24 <kasparnet> well, JAWS actually saves the settings in two separate files -- some settings go into one file, others go into another
2016-08-11T12:16:28 <kasparnet> so this is no problem with common terms
2016-08-11T12:16:49 <kasparnet> since their transformations are split into the different settingshandlers
2016-08-11T12:17:19 <kasparnet> but for application specific settings, which are just a long list of settings, the system has no way of knowing which settingshandler should retrieve which settings

2016-08-11T15:55:12 <alanharnum> Justin_o: re ESLint, these are the two config files I\'m using with it for one of my repos: https://github.com/waharnum/learningDashboard/blob/FLOE-455/.eslintrc.json / https://github.com/waharnum/learningDashboard/blob/FLOE-455/.eslintignore
2016-08-11T15:55:34 <alanharnum> looks like you\'re right that it should simply ignore node_modules
2016-08-11T15:57:00 <Justin_o> alanharnum: also take a look at the first point from the readme https://github.com/fluid-project/fluid-grunt-eslint
2016-08-11T15:57:04 <Justin_o> for our grunt plugin
2016-08-11T15:59:28 <alanharnum> i\'m using the fluid-grunt-eslint plugin as well yeah
2016-08-11T16:01:17 <Justin_o> alanharnum: and you don\'t see it running against the node_modules directory
2016-08-11T16:01:21 <Justin_o> ?
2016-08-11T16:01:22 <alanharnum> nope
2016-08-11T16:01:30 <alanharnum> it seems to skip that automatically
2016-08-11T16:01:48 <alanharnum> which repo are you seeing the issue in?
2016-08-11T16:01:59 <Justin_o> alanharnum: i noticed because i saw the total number of files was very high, considering i should have only had about 3 that it was run against. then i used the verbose mode and saw that it listed files from node_modules
2016-08-11T16:02:05 <Justin_o> fluid-publish
2016-08-11T16:02:17 <Justin_o> but i\'m just adding eslint to that now
2016-08-11T16:02:48 <Justin_o> colinclark, alanharnum: also do you know which version of node we expect to be running against these days
2016-08-11T16:03:45 <alanharnum> can\'t say oficially, but I believe "latest LTS"
2016-08-11T16:05:21 <gtirloni> <mandatory>Latest LTS will be node 6.x in 2 months -- https://github.com/nodejs/LTS</mandatory>
2016-08-11T16:05:48 * gtirloni used XML to make it more official
2016-08-11T16:06:14 <Justin_o> gtirloni: :)
2016-08-11T16:06:36 <Justin_o> gtirloni: could you use JSON to tell me what i should be running against right now
2016-08-11T16:06:56 * the-t-in-rtf has quit
2016-08-11T16:10:32 <gtirloni> i\'m not aware of any service that provides that at this moment
2016-08-11T16:14:25 <Justin_o> gtirloni: i was joking about your mandatory xml :)
2016-08-11T16:23:34 <gtirloni> lol, completely missed that
2016-08-11T16:24:00 <gtirloni> but yeah, we\'re using 4.x now.. that\'s what all the automation code is set to use
2016-08-11T16:25:35 <gtirloni> right now one would have to switch to \'current\' branch in order to get nodejs 6.x in that way (https://github.com/idi-ops/ansible-nodejs/blob/master/defaults/main.yml#L6-L8)
2016-08-11T16:25:54 <gtirloni> but we will only point \'lts\' to 6.x once it actually becomes LTS and our projects do work with it
2016-08-11T16:26:10 <gtirloni> i believe they will keep both 4.x and 6.x as LTS, there\'s an overlap
