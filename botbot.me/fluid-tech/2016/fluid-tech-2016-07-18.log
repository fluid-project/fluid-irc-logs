2016-07-18T17:16:11 <Bosmon> gtirloni - our CI bot seems to have gone a bit mad
2016-07-18T17:16:31 <gtirloni> Bosmon: it's building PRs that were okay'ed
2016-07-18T17:17:01 <Bosmon> ok, I see
2016-07-18T17:24:58 <colinclark> Bosmon: We have some permissions issues
2016-07-18T17:25:03 <colinclark> let's let it go mad :)

2016-07-18T19:34:16 <Bosmon> gtirloni - I'm starting to get multiple notifications for each pull/job
2016-07-18T19:34:32 <Bosmon> About 6 for #69 for example
2016-07-18T19:44:42 <colinclark> Bosmon: If you're referring to the gpii-bot's CI notifications, avtar is currently working on the bot
2016-07-18T19:44:45 <colinclark> hence the email spam
2016-07-18T19:44:48 <colinclark> please be patient
2016-07-18T19:44:58 <colinclark> seems like we're getting close
2016-07-18T19:45:48 <colinclark> I like to think of it as a kind of pull request karma :P
2016-07-18T19:50:18 <colinclark> ooh look, it passed!
2016-07-18T19:51:18 <Bosmon> Wow, we had one pass!
2016-07-18T19:51:31 <colinclark> yes
2016-07-18T19:51:43 <colinclark> it seems that avtar is making good progress!
