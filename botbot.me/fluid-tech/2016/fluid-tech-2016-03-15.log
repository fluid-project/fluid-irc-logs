2016-03-15T16:25:47 <simonjb> colinclark: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia_G-Sync and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD_FreeSync
2016-03-15T16:26:15 <simonjb> "FreeSync has a dynamic refresh rate range of 9\xe2\x80\x93240 Hz" from wikipedia page
2016-03-15T16:26:54 <simonjb> not sure about the G-Sync range
2016-03-15T16:30:02 <colinclark> thanks!
2016-03-15T16:36:51 <simonjb> "Potential ranges include 36-240Hz, 21-144Hz, 17-120Hz and 9-60Hz." http://support.amd.com/en-us/search/faq/222
2016-03-15T16:40:27 <simonjb> I guess to play at lower frame rates, you wouldn\'t need to necessarily require support for the exact rate, but some multiple would do
