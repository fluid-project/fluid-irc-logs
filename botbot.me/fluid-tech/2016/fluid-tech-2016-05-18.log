2016-05-18T09:07:42 <kasparnet> morning amatas (and Bosmon)
2016-05-18T09:07:53 <kasparnet> I got some production configuration working with your VMs now
2016-05-18T09:07:56 <kasparnet> https://github.com/GPII/universal/compare/master...kaspermarkus:GPII-1781-2?expand=1
2016-05-18T09:08:04 <kasparnet> (ie. my GPII-1781-2 branch)
2016-05-18T09:09:09 <kasparnet> as you can see there is now an extra production test file in the test folder called "ProductionConfigTests.CI.js" which uses the same test definitions as the regular production tests, but with a different configuration file which overrides the preferences server URL
2016-05-18T09:09:44 <kasparnet> (which by the way I\'m just realizing is using "localhost" instead of "server", but that should be a quick change)
2016-05-18T09:10:11 <kasparnet> could you check that it\'s working for you at some point, amatas?
2016-05-18T09:22:13 <amatas> Morging kasparnet!
2016-05-18T09:22:27 <amatas> sure, will check it out
2016-05-18T09:34:26 <amatas> kasparnet, All tests concluded: 4/5 total passed in 801ms - FAIL
2016-05-18T09:35:40 <amatas> kasparnet, in this line the name of the config file doesn\'t match the file name (the first letter is in lowcase) https://github.com/GPII/universal/compare/master...kaspermarkus:GPII-1781-2?expand=1#diff-77973ab3f76a1c3903b9a542466adad6R35
2016-05-18T09:37:44 <amatas> kasparnet, sorry, all the tests pass if I sustitute the "localhost" string by "server" in cloudBased.production.json and ProductionTestsCI.json
2016-05-18T09:38:15 <kasparnet> ah cool
2016-05-18T09:38:17 <amatas> is it correct that the CI tests depend on cloudBased.production.json?
2016-05-18T09:38:20 <kasparnet> and sorry for not doing that myself
2016-05-18T09:38:23 <kasparnet> yup
2016-05-18T09:38:34 <amatas> awesome then
2016-05-18T09:38:34 <kasparnet> so they depend on 4 config files
2016-05-18T09:38:46 <kasparnet> the two files in the diff I linked
2016-05-18T09:38:52 <kasparnet> (ie. at the bottom)
2016-05-18T09:39:12 <kasparnet> and then the two configs references from those files
2016-05-18T09:39:25 <kasparnet> which are the actual production configurations
2016-05-18T09:39:59 <amatas> Sorry I have to leave for a while.
2016-05-18T09:40:03 <kasparnet> no worries
2016-05-18T09:40:05 <kasparnet> tty later
2016-05-18T09:41:00 <kasparnet> I guess one improvement that would be nice to have (perhaps not right now, since it\'s screwed in kettle) is the same behavior with status 301 on HTTP with redirect to HTTPS. Just to make sure that we\'re testing as close to production as possible
2016-05-18T09:41:18 <kasparnet> Antranig - will the HTTPS issue be fixed in the big patch?
2016-05-18T09:41:35 <kasparnet> or is this something that we need a separate pull request for?
2016-05-18T10:58:50 <Bosmon> kasparnet - already fixed and tested: https://github.com/amb26/kettle/blob/KETTLE-32/tests/DataSourceURLTests.js#L32

2016-05-18T13:12:08 <Bosmon> Hi kasparnet
2016-05-18T13:12:28 <kasparnet> In terms of making the canopy matchmaker the default of the system
2016-05-18T13:12:46 <kasparnet> should I modify all (most of the) acceptance tests to use it as well
2016-05-18T13:12:57 <kasparnet> right now they\'re using the flat MM
2016-05-18T13:13:24 <kasparnet> which there is a certain value in - because it\'s easier to figure out why some settings/solutions are picked
2016-05-18T13:13:44 <kasparnet> on the other hand, using the canopy MM, we get closer to how the system works in real life
2016-05-18T13:14:09 <kasparnet> originally my plan was just to create one/some additional configs - but I\'m not so sure anymore
2016-05-18T13:14:51 <kasparnet> ... perhaps I should even come up with a (limited) list of sensible configs that we want to use in the system ... spring cleanup sort of thing

2016-05-18T16:38:53 <amatas> Hi Bosmon, the production tests that Kasper pushed this morining pass in the Vagrant CI environment
2016-05-18T16:39:28 <amatas> do you need to use this environment to test the great PR?
2016-05-18T16:39:41 * colinclark has quit
2016-05-18T16:40:32 <Bosmon> amatas - yes
2016-05-18T16:40:36 <Bosmon> Where did he push them?
2016-05-18T16:40:41 <Bosmon> And what do I need to set this up?
2016-05-18T16:49:37 * the-t-in-rtf has quit
2016-05-18T16:51:55 <amatas> checkout this repository: https://github.com/amatas/vagrant-gpii-server-client
2016-05-18T16:52:30 <amatas> and exec "vagrant up server fedora" at the root of the repository
2016-05-18T16:53:07 <amatas> when you have both vms up, get in the fedora vm: "vagrant ssh fedora"
2016-05-18T16:53:47 <amatas> there is a checkout of the gpii universal in /home/vagrant/gpii/node_modules/universal/
2016-05-18T16:54:34 <amatas> the production tests that work are in this branch: https://github.com/amatas/GPII-universal/tree/GPII-1781
2016-05-18T16:56:23 <amatas> Bosmon, ^
2016-05-18T16:57:09 * michelled has quit
2016-05-18T17:00:14 <Bosmon> Hi amatas - I\'m a bit lost as to the relationship between the two repositories
2016-05-18T17:01:36 <Bosmon> So your vagrant-gpii-server-client is currently pointing at master?
2016-05-18T17:02:35 <Bosmon> So what I do is ssh into the machine and check out a different branch of universal from within it?
2016-05-18T17:02:41 * jessm joined the channel
2016-05-18T17:03:00 <Bosmon> How do I then run the production tests
2016-05-18T17:03:08 <Bosmon> I\'m lost, sorry ...
2016-05-18T17:17:30 <amatas> np Bosmon, the vagrant-gpii-server-client only contains the definitions of the VMs
2016-05-18T17:18:03 <Bosmon> OK, so how do I use this project?
2016-05-18T17:18:07 <amatas> that definitions builds the VMs, and install Couchdb and preferences server in the server side
2016-05-18T17:19:00 <amatas> I guess that the content of that repository will be merged in the GPII universal /vagrant/ directory
2016-05-18T17:19:07 <amatas> in a future
2016-05-18T17:19:33 <amatas> to use it checkout the source code and run  "vagrant up server fedora" at the root of the repository
2016-05-18T17:23:05 * alanharnum joined the channel
2016-05-18T17:24:45 <amatas> Bosmon, let me know if something goes wrong with the VMs
2016-05-18T17:25:31 <Bosmon> amatas - I\'m sorry I\'m still not clear
2016-05-18T17:25:43 <Bosmon> Do you think you could write up a detailed set of instructions in how to use this?
2016-05-18T17:25:51 <Bosmon> That is, command by command?
2016-05-18T17:26:01 <amatas> sure, wait a sec
2016-05-18T17:28:01 * colinclark joined the channel
2016-05-18T17:30:25 <amatas> Bosmon, https://pad.gpii.net/p/vm-ci-gca2oae
2016-05-18T17:32:21 <Bosmon> amatas - thanks
2016-05-18T17:32:36 <Bosmon> amatas - so why is this command necessary: sudo systemctl stop gpii-linux-framework
2016-05-18T17:32:49 <Bosmon> And - how does the ProductionConfigTests.CI.js file get into the VM?
2016-05-18T17:33:48 <amatas> ups, sorry, I missed one step
2016-05-18T17:34:51 <amatas> the sudo command, is because the gpii-linux is running and use the port 8081, so the tests will fail because they can\'t use that port
2016-05-18T17:35:06 <Bosmon> amatas - ok
2016-05-18T17:35:19 <Bosmon> Would it be possible to turn this into a pull request against our current master, so that it runs in a self-contained way?
2016-05-18T17:35:46 <amatas> the file  ProductionConfigTests.CI.js is in the VM because it checkouts my fork of universal
2016-05-18T17:36:34 <Bosmon> yes, ok
2016-05-18T17:36:41 <Bosmon> Could you add all the rest of the material to your fork too?
2016-05-18T17:37:31 <amatas> sure, but I have to see how to live with the actual Vagrant definitions of universal
2016-05-18T17:38:28 <Bosmon> ok, cool
2016-05-18T17:38:41 <Bosmon> gtirloni - is this something perhaps you could help with?
2016-05-18T17:39:44 <amatas> perhaps a new directory with the contents
2016-05-18T17:40:39 <amatas> or maybe I can join all the stuff in the same Vagrantfile, but it requires some time.

2016-05-18T17:41:44 * kasparnet has quit
2016-05-18T17:43:22 <amatas> Bosmon, my next step will be that PR to master
2016-05-18T17:47:05 <Bosmon> amatas - awesome!
2016-05-18T17:48:22 <gtirloni> sorry, was afk. sure, i can help.. just let me know. if the port needs to be changed, it can either be a environment var (VM_HOST_TCP_PORT) or a variable in provisioning/vars.yml (nodejs_app_tcp_port)
2016-05-18T17:51:52 <amatas> gtirloni, I think is not a big problem
2016-05-18T18:02:00 <avtar> amatas, gtirloni: regarding https://github.com/amatas/vagrant-gpii-server-client/blob/master/provisioning/playbook-server.yml#L23-L31
2016-05-18T18:03:14 <avtar> i\'m assuming someone else might want tls set up with nginx at some point in a dev vm
2016-05-18T18:04:12 <avtar> could that be incorporated into the nginx role?
2016-05-18T18:04:57 <amatas> avtar, you mean to add a "easy-rsa" wrapper or something like that?
2016-05-18T18:06:00 * kasparnet joined the channel
2016-05-18T18:07:03 <amatas> or, maybe a couple of tasks in the nginx role that sets all the tls files should be enough, I can work on that
2016-05-18T18:09:14 <avtar> amatas: yes, the second option sounds good. something that would allow you to specify "nginx_enable_self_signed_certs: true" here or in other scenarios
2016-05-18T18:09:25 <amatas> ok
2016-05-18T18:10:54 <avtar> amatas: also the hosts files entries https://github.com/amatas/vagrant-gpii-server-client/blob/master/provisioning/playbook-fedora.yml#L14-L16 and https://github.com/amatas/vagrant-gpii-server-client/blob/master/provisioning/playbook-server.yml#L14-L16 might be better fits for variable files
2016-05-18T18:11:09 <avtar> https://gist.github.com/rothgar/8793800
2016-05-18T18:11:11 * kasparnet has quit
2016-05-18T18:11:22 <gtirloni> since the need to generate certificates exists outside nginx, it would be nice to have it as a separate role
2016-05-18T18:12:09 <avtar> the third comment in that gist points to a role which could work as well
2016-05-18T18:12:18 <avtar> the role seems to have windows support which is interesting
2016-05-18T18:13:15 <avtar> gtirloni: ah makes sense
2016-05-18T18:14:27 <gtirloni> generating certs has two common cases: self-signed certificates and let\'s encrypt certificates. since the latter are free and can be generated on the fly, it makes sense to use them for anything public. for the dev\'s vagrant boxes that\'s not possible, because let\'s encrypt requires the website be accessible to validate ownership
2016-05-18T18:14:47 * kasparnet joined the channel
2016-05-18T18:15:24 <gtirloni> i think adding cert generation tasks to the nginx roles will make them too large.. and it starts to become spaghetti code with the way the tasks are organized in ansible (imho)
2016-05-18T18:19:37 * kasparnet has quit
2016-05-18T18:24:41 <amatas> agree with gtirloni, also the cert generation is something that you only run once when you create the cert. I guess that a directory with the cert files at control host, and some tasks to store the certs/keys in the servers could be enough.
2016-05-18T18:28:58 <avtar> amatas: not having this be part of the nginx role seems fair enough but i think there\'s value in having this type of work be handled by a separate role
2016-05-18T18:29:18 <avtar> something that can be used in different scenarios
2016-05-18T18:30:07 <avtar> instead of having this pki directory live in gpii/universal and then in other project repos where a tls enabled web server might be required
