2016-03-01T19:00:54 <Justin_o> nemil: In addition to starting to familiarize yourself with infusion in general and more specifically with the preferences framework, you\'ll want to start thinking about how you\'ll approach the  project, e.g. your process,  technical aspects and etc. Also there is some information on the proposal structure on our GSoC org page
2016-03-01T19:00:55 <Justin_o> https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/5729245854695424/
2016-03-01T19:01:40 <nemil> I will surely look into it. Thanks!

2016-03-01T19:48:09 <discoman> I guess some test is failing "assertion" but I am not able to understand empty template supplied. Please can anyone help me.
2016-03-01T19:48:33 <discoman> This happens in almost all demos I run and none of them works properly
