2016-08-04T18:09:35 <clown> avtar:  I destroyed and rebuilt the vagrant windows VM.  When I try to run \'node\' I get \'node : The term \'node\' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program.\'
2016-08-04T18:09:53 <clown> I looked at the output, and noticed a number of npm errors:  http://pastie.org/10929886
2016-08-04T18:10:05 <clown> although, those look like grunt installation problems.
2016-08-04T18:10:08 <clown> any ideas?
2016-08-04T18:11:31 <avtar> clown: did you restart the vm? we need to pick up windows path changes since node, npm, and others get installed when the vm and consequently windows is first started
2016-08-04T18:11:51 <clown> I did (1) vagrant destroy, (2) vagrant up.
2016-08-04T18:11:56 <clown> is there a step 1.5?
2016-08-04T18:12:04 <avtar> unfortunately, yes
2016-08-04T18:12:07 <avtar> vagrant reload
2016-08-04T18:12:09 <clown> aha!
2016-08-04T18:12:11 <clown> what it is it?
2016-08-04T18:13:37 <avtar> although that\'s step #3 not 1.5
2016-08-04T18:14:45 <clown> I\'ll try that, thanks
2016-08-04T18:20:00 <clown> okay, that worked.  Thanks avtar
2016-08-04T18:29:41 <avtar> np
2016-08-04T18:30:45 <clown> avtar (or anyone):  do any of the windows unit tests pass?  I\'m seeing a common failure when there is a dependency of ref.js

2016-08-04T19:46:16 <avtar> hey clown
2016-08-04T19:46:24 <clown> yo, avtar
2016-08-04T19:46:33 <avtar> i missed your message earlier but i believe they should be passing now
2016-08-04T19:46:50 <clown> so, destroy my VM and rebuild it?
2016-08-04T19:48:43 <clown> avtar ^
2016-08-04T19:49:08 <avtar> yup
2016-08-04T19:49:32 <avtar> are you using gpii/windows master?
2016-08-04T19:50:39 <clown> I\'ve been merging gpii/windows master into my GPII-442 branch.  I just checked and there is nothing new in gpii-master.  Did it change in the last 5 minute?
2016-08-04T19:50:52 <avtar> probably not :P
2016-08-04T19:51:18 <clown> just checked again.  Latest change was 25 days ago.  I have that change.
2016-08-04T19:51:37 <avtar> but if you have any uncertainties regarding tests passing the easiest way to confirm would be to check out master and use a vm to check locally
2016-08-04T19:52:39 <clown> yeah, that\'s true.
2016-08-04T19:53:13 <clown> I\'ll double check using master
2016-08-04T20:25:07 <clown> avtar, double checked using master.  still get the same error.
2016-08-04T20:28:53 <clown> here\'s what I get:  http://pastie.org/10930189

2016-08-04T20:42:33 <avtar> clown: just curious, what does your \'provisioning\\chocolatey-packages.bat\' file look like?
2016-08-04T20:43:15 * clown looks
2016-08-04T20:43:51 <clown> avtar, it\'s pretty small.  I\'ll paste it here:
2016-08-04T20:43:52 <clown> choco install nodejs.install -version 4.4.3 --forcex86 -y
2016-08-04T20:43:52 <clown> choco install python2 -y
2016-08-04T20:43:52 <clown> choco install innosetup -y
2016-08-04T20:43:52 <clown> setx /M PATH "%PATH%;C:\\Program Files (x86)\
odejs;C:\\tools\\python2;C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Inno Setup 5"
2016-08-04T20:46:36 <clown> avtar, just checked github.  No difference:  https://github.com/GPII/windows/blob/master/provisioning/chocolatey-packages.bat
2016-08-04T20:51:05 <avtar> that looks fine
