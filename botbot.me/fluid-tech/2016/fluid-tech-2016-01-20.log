2016-01-20T16:32:31 <cindyli> Bosmon, simonjb, these two review comments on my GPII-1546 pull request are regarding using the new kettle feature to improve the end point /add-preferences
2016-01-20T16:32:33 <cindyli> https://github.com/amb26/universal/pull/2/files#r49770108
2016-01-20T16:32:42 <cindyli> https://github.com/amb26/universal/pull/2/files#r49770337
2016-01-20T16:33:24 <cindyli> we have a jira for it - https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-1521
2016-01-20T16:34:08 <cindyli> this seems a relatively big improvement to me. i wonder if we should address it in a separate pull request using GPII-1521 ticket
2016-01-20T16:34:11 <cindyli> what do you think?
2016-01-20T16:36:58 <Bosmon> cindyli sure, ok
2016-01-20T16:48:08 * anastasiac joined the channel
2016-01-20T16:48:24 <simonjb> yes cindyli, that seems reasonable to me too
2016-01-20T16:55:23 <cindyli> cool. thanks, Bosmon and simonjb. another comment https://github.com/amb26/universal/pull/2/files#r49770322 was for adding docs for AuthorizationService.js. any opinion of where we should create this doc? an .md file in universal/documentation folder or in the same folder as AuthorizationService.js, or a wiki page at wiki.gpii.net?
2016-01-20T16:57:30 <Bosmon> I think an md file is good for now
2016-01-20T16:57:45 <Bosmon> I imagine that in time we will have a proper docpad-generated docs site for the GPII
2016-01-20T16:57:51 <Bosmon> And this will make it easier to move to that model
2016-01-20T17:00:00 <cindyli> Bosmon: should i place the md file in universal/documentation folder?
2016-01-20T17:01:22 <cindyli> Bosmon: just placing this doc alone without the context of the security server doesn\'t seem making lots of sense
2016-01-20T17:01:31 <Bosmon> cindyli - sure
2016-01-20T17:04:17 <cindyli> Bosmon: "sure" means using universal/documentation folder?
2016-01-20T17:04:25 <Bosmon> cindyli - yes
2016-01-20T17:04:28 <cindyli> ok
2016-01-20T17:04:34 <cindyli> thanks
