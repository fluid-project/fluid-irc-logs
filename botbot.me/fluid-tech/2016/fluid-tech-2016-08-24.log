2016-08-24T14:10:14 <cindyli> the-t-in-rtf: using this channel since fluid-work is getting busy. is this the persistent grade I should use - https://github.com/the-t-in-rtf/gpii-pouchdb/blob/GPII-1897/src/test/test-harness.js#L54
2016-08-24T14:10:32 <the-t-in-rtf> yup
2016-08-24T14:11:38 <cindyli> i wonder why it\'s using "gpii.test" namespace. the "test" gives an impression of for the testing purpose
2016-08-24T14:11:43 <cindyli> the-t-in-rtf: ^
2016-08-24T14:12:36 <the-t-in-rtf> Well, you\'re still talking about using this in a dev environment, right?
2016-08-24T14:13:46 * alanharnum has quit
2016-08-24T14:14:39 <cindyli> yes, but dev isn\'t testing. and this component is useful in general for using pouchdb with node
2016-08-24T14:15:55 <cindyli> the-t-in-rtf: ^
2016-08-24T14:17:12 <the-t-in-rtf> We should discuss on our next call with @Bosmon and @simonjb, Antranig wanted a bright line between the one that persists, and the one that doesn\'t.
2016-08-24T14:17:39 <the-t-in-rtf> It seemed like we had tests that needed to persist?
2016-08-24T14:17:46 <Bosmon> That\'s one line, but this is another :)
2016-08-24T14:17:49 <the-t-in-rtf> yes.
2016-08-24T14:17:53 <the-t-in-rtf> exactly.
2016-08-24T14:18:02 <Bosmon> If it is something that is useful outside tests, it should be placed outside the .test namespace
2016-08-24T14:18:31 <the-t-in-rtf> I\'m fine with that, just a bit cautious in dragging the work over that particular line\xe2\x80\xa6 :)

2016-08-24T16:16:09 <the-t-in-rtf> @cindyli, it should very much be possible to have multiple pouch instances, I am nearly gone for today but am totally free during our overlap tomorrow.
2016-08-24T16:16:12 <the-t-in-rtf> happy to review together.
2016-08-24T16:16:41 <cindyli> great to know. thanks for letting me know. yay!
2016-08-24T16:19:00 <the-t-in-rtf> Feel free to create a pastie with the error, I might even be able to advise you now.

2016-08-24T16:30:26 <cindyli> the-t-in-rtf: seems there might be other changes i made recently that broke acceptance tests into a worse status. the current error message is not useful since it\'s not pouch related - http://pastebin.com/1dKCHLYd
2016-08-24T16:30:51 <cindyli> i will come back for your advice when i get to the point with using multiple pouchdbs
2016-08-24T16:30:55 <the-t-in-rtf> sure.
2016-08-24T16:31:19 <cindyli> the-t-in-rtf: do you plan to move pouch harness components out of the test folder?
2016-08-24T16:31:34 <the-t-in-rtf> yes, it\'s on my list.
2016-08-24T16:31:42 <the-t-in-rtf> just listening\xe2\x80\xa6 :P
2016-08-24T16:31:58 <cindyli> sorry
2016-08-24T16:32:04 <the-t-in-rtf> no worries.
2016-08-24T16:32:19 <the-t-in-rtf> in any other meeting it would already be done.
2016-08-24T16:43:53 <cindyli> the-t-in-rtf: do you plan to do it soon? sounds like u r already on it. just wanna get some ideas of whether i should wait to pull until it gets in
2016-08-24T16:44:07 <the-t-in-rtf> tomorrow.
2016-08-24T16:44:12 <the-t-in-rtf> It\'s on my calendar, even.
2016-08-24T16:44:19 <cindyli> cool. thanks a lot, the-t-in-rtf
