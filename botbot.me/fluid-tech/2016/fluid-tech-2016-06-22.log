2016-06-22T18:04:20 <colinclark> Bosmon: Can I think aloud with you for a bit about my Flocking/Chart Authoring issues?
2016-06-22T18:04:32 <colinclark> it looks like alanharnum-datac is in the Data Centre, but at least he can follow along later
2016-06-22T18:04:50 <Bosmon> Hi there colinclark
2016-06-22T18:05:29 <colinclark> I hope you\'ll forgiving me for thinking through this somewhat randomly
2016-06-22T18:05:35 <colinclark> my first thought is that this is all very tricky
2016-06-22T18:05:37 <Bosmon> That\'s fine
2016-06-22T18:05:48 <Bosmon> YOu are following a time-honoured design technique :)
2016-06-22T18:05:50 <colinclark> hahaha
2016-06-22T18:06:03 <colinclark> Like those Elizabeth Sanders squiggles
2016-06-22T18:06:17 <colinclark> Anyway, one thing to say is that Flocking\'s design is certainly problematic
2016-06-22T18:06:26 <colinclark> in terms of the environment/node coupling
2016-06-22T18:06:39 <colinclark> where a node removes itself from the environment explicitly, etc.
2016-06-22T18:06:53 <colinclark> I can\'t address the actual design issue until after the 0.2.0 release
2016-06-22T18:07:00 <colinclark> because it will be quite significantly breaking for many, many users
2016-06-22T18:07:13 <Bosmon> many, many!
2016-06-22T18:07:26 <colinclark> Arranging the order of multiple synths is a pretty common use case
2016-06-22T18:07:37 <colinclark> I expect I\'d break many of my own compositions, as well as those of others
2016-06-22T18:07:41 <colinclark> which I will do anyway
2016-06-22T18:07:48 <colinclark> but I\'d rather batch up several breaking changes into one release
2016-06-22T18:07:52 <colinclark> and this one isn\'t it :)
2016-06-22T18:08:05 <colinclark> Anyway, so a few other things occur to me
2016-06-22T18:08:19 <colinclark> The Chart Authoring tool, in the long run, is a classic "widget"
2016-06-22T18:08:37 <colinclark> in the sense that one can easily imagine an OER authoring environment in which a teacher might drop in multiple pie charts
2016-06-22T18:08:43 <colinclark> each of which sonify different data
2016-06-22T18:09:00 <colinclark> and then the teacher might well say "Okay, I don\'t need this chart on this page" and remove the component
2016-06-22T18:09:13 <Bosmon> Yes
2016-06-22T18:09:18 <Bosmon> "In theory these things are fine"
2016-06-22T18:09:21 <colinclark> :)
2016-06-22T18:09:28 <Bosmon> But they should be mediated by event binding rather than instance binding
2016-06-22T18:09:54 <colinclark> do you want to elaborate there, just so I\'m clear?
2016-06-22T18:10:52 <Bosmon> Yes.... the framework has various ways of "automatedly associating" components together
2016-06-22T18:10:59 <Bosmon> Basically, two
2016-06-22T18:11:12 <Bosmon> Binding of listeners/modelListeners and model relay
2016-06-22T18:11:16 <colinclark> yes
2016-06-22T18:12:12 <Bosmon> It doesn\'t encourage you to physically acquire component instances and ship them around the place
2016-06-22T18:12:35 <Bosmon> For this very reason - it would require something a bit awkward and anti-idiomatic like a "volatile collection" or so
2016-06-22T18:12:45 <colinclark> yes
2016-06-22T18:12:45 <Bosmon> Given that, as we see, component instances can come and go at random
2016-06-22T18:13:16 <Bosmon> It\'s possible in the "sufficiently far future" we will have a very mature model system that will be ok treating components as "modellised material" but that day is pretty far off
2016-06-22T18:13:28 <colinclark> right
2016-06-22T18:13:44 <colinclark> It\'s clear to me that a Chart Authoring component should not, even now, expect to definitively create a Flocking environment, nor to absolutely destroy it
2016-06-22T18:13:59 <Bosmon> Yes, sounds reasonable
2016-06-22T18:14:10 <colinclark> but the question remains then, how do ensure that a single Flocking environment is available to all potential CA components that could exist?
2016-06-22T18:14:14 <Bosmon> Although if the environment is a test case dependency, it will have to negotiate this somehow
2016-06-22T18:14:17 <colinclark> yes
2016-06-22T18:14:20 <colinclark> fair enough
2016-06-22T18:14:24 <colinclark> and how do we clean it up if necessary
2016-06-22T18:14:28 <Bosmon> This is very similar to the "UIOptions relay" problem we faced some years ago
2016-06-22T18:14:32 <colinclark> yes
2016-06-22T18:14:36 <colinclark> it\'s very similar
2016-06-22T18:14:40 * gtirloni_ joined the channel
2016-06-22T18:14:46 <Bosmon> Where a UIOptions instance was required to integrate with 0 or more video player instances which may or may not be on the page
2016-06-22T18:15:27 <colinclark> right, exactly
2016-06-22T18:15:50 <colinclark> I haven\'t been able to come up with any non-brittle means for conditionally creating an environment and conditionally destroying it
2016-06-22T18:16:01 <colinclark> and doing so early enough that everything works correctly
2016-06-22T18:16:03 * gtirloni has quit
2016-06-22T18:16:28 <Bosmon> Yes, you can\'t
2016-06-22T18:16:35 <Bosmon> Which is why the schemes I mentioned are the only viable ones
2016-06-22T18:16:57 <colinclark> Which schemes?
2016-06-22T18:17:01 <Bosmon> listener or relay bindings
2016-06-22T18:17:18 <Bosmon> For now, we will just have to hack it
2016-06-22T18:17:29 <colinclark> bindings to what, though?
2016-06-22T18:17:33 * amatas has quit
2016-06-22T18:17:39 <Bosmon> bindings between "interactants"
2016-06-22T18:18:01 <Bosmon> That, whilst they co-exist, mediate their interaction
2016-06-22T18:18:15 <Bosmon> And once they cease to coexist, tear down the mediation
2016-06-22T18:18:40 <colinclark> in this case, we have two types of interactants
2016-06-22T18:18:50 <colinclark> the environment and the sonifier
2016-06-22T18:18:59 <Bosmon> Yes
2016-06-22T18:19:00 <colinclark> the latter contains some synths
2016-06-22T18:19:21 <colinclark> so I\'m not yet clear on what kind of mediation we can arrange
2016-06-22T18:19:29 <colinclark> and what sort of third party will have to mediate them
2016-06-22T18:20:30 <Bosmon> Well, typically the 3rd party is more closely attached to one of the two other parties, given its lifetime has to be bound to the lifetime of one of them - typically the shortest lifetime
2016-06-22T18:20:33 <Bosmon> In this case, the synths
2016-06-22T18:21:08 <Bosmon> Well, that\'s not quite right
2016-06-22T18:21:52 <Bosmon> The environment will broadcast down "report for duty" type options featuring listener bindings
2016-06-22T18:21:52 <Bosmon> Which will end up attached to the shorter lifetime things

2016-06-22T18:22:59 * gtirloni_ has quit
2016-06-22T18:26:08 <colinclark> And these optoins will be broadcast using distributeOptions?
2016-06-22T18:26:21 <colinclark> so to a particular type of "environmentally-interested component"?
2016-06-22T18:26:48 <Bosmon> Yes
