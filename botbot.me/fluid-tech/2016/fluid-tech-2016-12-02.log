2016-12-02T15:45:10 <gtirloni> gloob: for later consumption: i learned that Amazon DynamoDB (their document store) is HIPAA-compliant (https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/hipaa-compliance/  and a comparison table http://db-engines.com/en/system/Amazon+DynamoDB%3BCouchDB). sharing in case it\'s useful for future discussion about deploying to AWS.

2016-12-02T15:52:09 <amatas> gtirloni, vagrant 1.9.0 just landed on Arch
2016-12-02T15:52:28 * amatas is with hand on his eyes and pressing intro with the index finger...
2016-12-02T15:53:26 <gtirloni> haha
2016-12-02T15:53:49 <gtirloni> the changelog seems nice.. hyperv, `box prune` to remove old boxes and save some disk space
2016-12-02T15:54:12 <gtirloni> i\'ll install it on f25 here :) thanks for the heads up

2016-12-02T16:04:45 <amatas> it\'s incredible the market share of Oracle and MS SQL
2016-12-02T16:05:06 <amatas> http://pastie.org/10974896 <- nice!
2016-12-02T16:06:07 <amatas> where is CouchDB?
2016-12-02T16:06:37 <amatas> ok, it\'s hide
2016-12-02T16:16:01 <amatas> gtirloni, http://pastie.org/private/mm5mdq3vcm7dtndaidj3q
2016-12-02T16:17:01 <gtirloni> amatas: if you go back to regular vagrant user (without sudo), does it work?
2016-12-02T16:17:03 <amatas> it seems that yarn doesn\'t know that the effective id is an user
2016-12-02T16:17:14 <amatas> yes, it work
2016-12-02T16:17:36 <gtirloni> ok, it might be relying on a different way to find out which user it\'s running as (it thinks it\'s running as root)
2016-12-02T16:17:50 <amatas> I\'ll dig a bit more into this and perhaps open an issue
2016-12-02T16:18:27 <gtirloni> thanks
2016-12-02T16:19:39 <gtirloni> amatas: i found this the other day but i couldn\'t reproduce https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/1436
2016-12-02T16:21:31 <amatas> mm, seems that it\'s related

2016-12-02T18:08:02 <colinclark> hey gtirloni, I\'m just about to send the notes out finally from our ops meeting this week
2016-12-02T18:08:09 <colinclark> I wanted to include a link for this item: "\t\xe2\x80\xa2 Walkthrough of Alfredo\'s Vagrant plugin work"
2016-12-02T18:08:21 <colinclark> Do you know which repo it was that he showed us at the meeting?

2016-12-02T18:28:01 <gtirloni> colinclark: the original code is here https://github.com/amatas/vagrant-vmenv but i think the vagrant plugin is not that.. I think he may not have uploaded it yet?
