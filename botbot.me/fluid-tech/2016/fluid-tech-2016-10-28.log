2016-10-28T18:52:17 <clown> avtar, I have a question about this CI failure (when you have a moment): https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/82#issuecomment-256683093
2016-10-28T18:55:44 <avtar> hey clown
2016-10-28T18:55:58 <clown> hey avtar.
2016-10-28T18:56:07 <avtar> that looks like a virtualbox issue
2016-10-28T18:56:24 <clown> I\'m trying to find the email or console output for that error \xe2\x80\x94 right I think it is an VM problem.
2016-10-28T18:56:38 <clown> I found the trace yesterday, but I can find it again.
2016-10-28T18:56:47 <avtar> yeah, we haven\'t had those in a while
2016-10-28T18:56:47 <clown> I guess you found it.  Do you have a link?
2016-10-28T18:57:30 <avtar> vbox basically becomes unresponsive and in the past amatas or gio have had to restart the ci node
2016-10-28T18:57:47 <avtar> clown: i was just looking at the output logged here v
2016-10-28T18:57:48 <avtar> https://ci.gpii.net/job/create-windows-vm/81/console
2016-10-28T18:58:02 <avtar> particularly "Timed out while waiting for the machine to boot."
2016-10-28T18:58:14 <clown> That\'s it.  Thanks.
2016-10-28T18:58:58 <clown> Also (of minor note):  " A newer version of the box \'inclusivedesign/windows10-eval\' is available! You currently have version \'0.4.5\'. The latest is version \'0.4.6\'. Run `vagrant box update` to update."
2016-10-28T19:00:14 <avtar> i don\'t think the new box will prevent that issue from occurring
2016-10-28T19:00:34 * kasparnet joined the channel
2016-10-28T19:00:39 <avtar> amatas released that new box with windows updates and these changes https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2071
2016-10-28T19:01:02 * clown looks
2016-10-28T19:01:37 * clown misread the JIRA title as "\xe2\x80\xa6 and Microsoft Animalware"
2016-10-28T19:01:50 <avtar> but vbox not responding will prevent jenkins from getting even that far
2016-10-28T19:01:51 * clown lions and tigers and bears! oh my!
2016-10-28T19:01:57 <avtar> haha
2016-10-28T19:01:58 <clown> right, avtar.
