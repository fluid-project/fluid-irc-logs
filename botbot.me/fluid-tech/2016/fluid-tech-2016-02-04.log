2016-02-04T17:56:04 <Jess_> gtirloni: the list is still saying You don\'t have permission to access /pipermail/community/ on this server when i try to hit the archive. i know Justin_o just sent his email but shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t i be able to see it there?
2016-02-04T17:59:06 <gtirloni> Jess_: checking
2016-02-04T18:11:59 <gtirloni> Jess_: i don\'t know when the archiver run (the thing that picks the emails and generates the html pages) so i just ran it manually now -- i guess it\'s every 30min or so

2016-02-04T18:14:54 <Jess_> gtirloni: ah, it\xe2\x80\x99s there
2016-02-04T18:15:00 <Jess_> i was just being too excited :)
2016-02-04T18:16:52 <gtirloni> haha np
2016-02-04T18:16:52 <gtirloni> :)

2016-02-04T18:26:50 <Jess_> gtirloni: cool! michelled http://www.internationalwomensday.com/Activity/3631/Annual-International-Women-s-Day-Talks-2016
2016-02-04T18:27:20 <Jess_> i wonder if we should do something parallel to this \xe2\x80\x94 maybe even just have a \xe2\x80\x9cchat with a developer\xe2\x80\x9d open invite somewhere? is that weird?
2016-02-04T18:27:40 <michelled> sounds great! thx for sharing

2016-02-04T18:32:38 <Jess_> gtirloni: oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s so funny! that first link you sent i went to and didn\xe2\x80\x99t see any information \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s a scroll! i did a google search to find another page #designfail
2016-02-04T18:33:57 <gtirloni> yeah, it seems it adapts so the first purple "frame" always takes all the browser area first
2016-02-04T18:33:57 <gloob> seems universal is currently broken https://ybin.me/p/1d4cc3a2b457a032#L+2qnEztxkXgsFw5+gtSdtk0QjkkD+iiPzcjXohnWTc=
2016-02-04T18:34:35 <gloob> we need to define connect explicitely in package.json, seems an express dependency
2016-02-04T18:34:46 <gloob> or do I need something extra?
