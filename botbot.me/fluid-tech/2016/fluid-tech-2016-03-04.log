b"2016-03-04T19:38:01 <simonjb> I think I now need a more up to date node
2016-03-04T19:38:17 <simonjb> avtar ^
2016-03-04T19:39:24 <avtar> simonjb: i was able to provision it here
2016-03-04T19:39:45 <simonjb> hmm
2016-03-04T19:40:06 <simonjb> maybe my filesystem
2016-03-04T19:40:24 <simonjb> there would be a filesystem difference
2016-03-04T19:40:30 <avtar> https://www.pastery.net/wxjyjb/
2016-03-04T19:40:51 <simonjb> yeah, same as mine
2016-03-04T19:41:03 <simonjb> is it possible to update the node version?
2016-03-04T19:41:08 <avtar> yup

2016-03-04T19:41:34 <avtar> https://github.com/idi-ops/ansible-nodejs/blob/master/vars/RedHat.yml#L24
2016-03-04T19:42:15 <simonjb> can I make the change in my repo?
2016-03-04T19:43:25 <avtar> simonjb: try it with these changes https://www.pastery.net/zmddfw/
2016-03-04T19:44:12 <avtar> it's safest to destroy the vm and then 'vagrant up'
2016-03-04T19:45:15 <simonjb> sweet
2016-03-04T19:45:24 <simonjb> running vagrant up now
2016-03-04T19:48:22 <simonjb> avtar: still running old node
2016-03-04T19:49:39 <avtar> oh you're right
2016-03-04T19:54:12 <avtar> hmm 4.3.1 installs fine from the command line
2016-03-04T20:00:47 <simonjb> avtar: I going to stop early for the day now
2016-03-04T20:01:03 <simonjb> can we pick this up on Monday?
2016-03-04T20:01:15 <simonjb> I think it would be good to update the node version
2016-03-04T20:01:55 <avtar> simonjb: yeah monday sounds good
2016-03-04T20:02:02 <simonjb> thanks
2016-03-04T20:02:09 <simonjb> have a good weekend
2016-03-04T20:02:13 <avtar> you too
2016-03-04T20:04:30 <avtar> simonjb: figured it out, it was a typo on my part

2016-03-04T18:56:25 <simonjb> hey avtar, do you have a little time to talk ci and nexus?
2016-03-04T18:56:40 <avtar> simonjb: sure
2016-03-04T18:56:43 <simonjb> awesome
2016-03-04T18:56:59 <avtar> on vidyo or here?
2016-03-04T18:57:22 <simonjb> either is good for me -- do you have a preference?
2016-03-04T18:58:11 <avtar> not really :)
2016-03-04T18:58:20 <avtar> we can chat here if you want
2016-03-04T18:58:27 <simonjb> sure
2016-03-04T18:58:39 <simonjb> I see that there hasn\'t been a build since Feb 19
2016-03-04T18:58:47 <simonjb> https://ci.gpii.net/job/nexus-tests/
2016-03-04T18:58:56 <simonjb> and there have been code changes
2016-03-04T18:59:12 <simonjb> however, there\'s also been some repo fiddling about
2016-03-04T18:59:36 <simonjb> last Friday, I renamed by existing simonbates/nexus to simonbates/nexus-simon
2016-03-04T18:59:48 <simonjb> and cloned the new gpii/nexus to simonbates/nexus
2016-03-04T18:59:54 <avtar> ah
2016-03-04T18:59:56 <simonjb> (we are moving nexus to gpii)
2016-03-04T19:00:06 <simonjb> and I\'ve made changes to simonbates/nexus
2016-03-04T19:00:07 <avtar> also we were tracking your p4a f2f branch
2016-03-04T19:00:15 <simonjb> I thought both?
2016-03-04T19:00:19 <simonjb> master and that one
2016-03-04T19:00:45 <simonjb> going forward, we\'ll want to build the CI from gpii/nexus
2016-03-04T19:00:50 <avtar> sorry i meant that you were pushing changes to that non-master branch to trigger jobs for the demo
2016-03-04T19:00:51 <avtar> ok
2016-03-04T19:01:08 <simonjb> but until it\'s moved over I\'d like to build simonbates/nexus
2016-03-04T19:01:10 <simonjb> the new one
2016-03-04T19:01:17 <simonjb> with the same name as the old one
2016-03-04T19:01:20 <simonjb> if that makes sense
2016-03-04T19:02:20 <simonjb> I can\'t remember all that we did but was there a step where I had to enable a webhook
2016-03-04T19:02:43 <simonjb> I\'m guessing I would need to do that again for the new fork at simonbates/nexus
2016-03-04T19:03:37 <avtar> yes the \'jenkins github\' plugin should be enabled in the repo\'s settings
2016-03-04T19:03:52 <simonjb> ok, let me take a look
2016-03-04T19:04:36 <avtar> the webhook url is https://ci-int.gpii.net/github-webhook/
2016-03-04T19:04:40 <avtar> the trailing slash matters
2016-03-04T19:04:41 <simonjb> "add webhook" or "add service"
2016-03-04T19:05:33 <avtar> simonjb: add service
2016-03-04T19:05:43 <avtar> "Jenkins (GitHub plugin)"
2016-03-04T19:06:24 <avtar> i\'ll also need to make these changes https://github.com/GPII/ci-service/blob/master/jenkins_jobs/nexus.yml#L14-L17
2016-03-04T19:06:41 <avtar> colin is usually the one who merges stuff like that
2016-03-04T19:07:10 <avtar> but i believe Bosmon and sgithens also have commit access to the gpii/ci-service repo
2016-03-04T19:07:15 <simonjb> ok, I\'ve configured the webhook
2016-03-04T19:07:43 <simonjb> it should work as is though, right?
2016-03-04T19:07:52 <simonjb> your change would be to remove line 17?
2016-03-04T19:08:02 <simonjb> because it\'s no longer needed?
2016-03-04T19:08:11 <simonjb> the repo name is the same
2016-03-04T19:08:32 <simonjb> (until we merge into gpii/nexus -- then we\'ll need to change over)
2016-03-04T19:09:25 <avtar> gotcha
2016-03-04T19:09:38 <avtar> if we\'re not configuring new repos then it should work as-is
2016-03-04T19:10:00 <simonjb> awesome, so hopefully new the webhook should work again
2016-03-04T19:10:11 <simonjb> would you be able to kick off a build for me?
2016-03-04T19:10:33 <avtar> yup
2016-03-04T19:10:35 <avtar> one sec
2016-03-04T19:10:43 <simonjb> hopefully it\'ll work and won\'t be confused with the repo switching
2016-03-04T19:11:05 <simonjb> worst case, we\'ll need to remove the git checkout, but hopefully it works
2016-03-04T19:11:41 * alanharnum joined the channel
2016-03-04T19:13:48 <avtar> simonjb: uh oh
2016-03-04T19:13:49 <avtar> Error: Cannot find module \'infusion\'
2016-03-04T19:14:29 <simonjb> :(
2016-03-04T19:15:08 <simonjb> I didn\'t try the vm locally here, only running the tests on my host machine
2016-03-04T19:15:16 <simonjb> let me see if I can reproduce
2016-03-04T19:15:39 <simonjb> ah
2016-03-04T19:15:43 <simonjb> yes
2016-03-04T19:15:44 <avtar> https://github.com/simonbates/nexus/blob/master/provisioning/vars.yml#L21
2016-03-04T19:15:54 <simonjb> the install step has changed
2016-03-04T19:16:02 <simonjb> yes, exactly
2016-03-04T19:16:05 <avtar> ok
2016-03-04T19:16:12 <simonjb> now just npm install
2016-03-04T19:16:19 <simonjb> will fix that now
2016-03-04T19:16:34 <simonjb> (and this way we can test the webhook!)
2016-03-04T19:16:38 <avtar> yes :D
2016-03-04T19:17:02 <simonjb> and this time I\'ll verify the vagrant locally first :)

2016-03-04T19:31:50 <simonjb> have you seen this before?
2016-03-04T19:32:06 <simonjb> I tried vagrant destroy and then up again but same error
2016-03-04T19:32:40 <simonjb> only change is "npm run fullinstall" -> "npm install"
2016-03-04T19:33:47 <avtar> hmm
2016-03-04T19:33:51 <avtar> no i haven\'t seen that befor
2016-03-04T19:33:53 <avtar> e
2016-03-04T19:34:25 <avtar> i\'ll try it here
2016-03-04T19:37:07 <simonjb> ah
2016-03-04T19:37:16 <simonjb> I think it might be the version of node and npm
2016-03-04T19:37:48 <simonjb> this vm is using the old node 0.10.41
