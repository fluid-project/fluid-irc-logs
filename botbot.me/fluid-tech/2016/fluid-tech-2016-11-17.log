2016-11-17T15:33:02 <gtirloni> amatas: hey! yeah, i spent some time investigating vagrant\'s internals. it seems there are way too many different to \'hook\' into vagrant (the AWS plugin is supposed to be \'the reference\' but even that one seems to be doing things in the old way)
2016-11-17T15:33:48 <amatas> ok nice
2016-11-17T15:33:56 <gtirloni> amatas: most of the tutorials and 3rd-party docs talk about an old way.. it seems vagrant now has all these action hooks, which not all plugins are using.. but it looks like the \'proper\' way of doing it
2016-11-17T15:35:04 <gtirloni> i think once a plugin gets loaded, it can pretty much do anything.. but the main committer (mitchellh) created this generic action framework to try and add some sanity to the thing
2016-11-17T15:35:18 <amatas> I guess that these could be good examples: https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/tree/master/plugins
2016-11-17T15:36:11 <gtirloni> yea, the core ones are probably the best examples. there\'s some inconsistency in them but it\'s usually sane
2016-11-17T15:37:09 <amatas> gtirloni, I think so as well, I would like to try to "overload" the machine_config method to avoid the use of the Vagrantfile if a .gitlab.yml is found.  https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/blob/master/lib/vagrant/vagrantfile.rb#L169
2016-11-17T15:38:47 <amatas> well, lets see if we get some feedback of your mail at the arch list
2016-11-17T15:40:24 <gtirloni> ok
2016-11-17T15:44:02 <gtirloni> i\'m thinking.. if you fetch the Vagrantfile templates, generate their final form and store on disk, yeah.. looks like machine_config would be the place to consume that
2016-11-17T15:45:06 <gtirloni> do you thik you\'d have to check upstream for new Vagrantfile template all the time when starting a machine? Or it\'s up to the user to \'initialize\' the environment before doing `vagrant up`.. what are your thoughts
2016-11-17T15:49:56 <amatas> I think that from the point of view of a developer it could be easier to only use one of the usual commands (vagrant [up|ssh|reload|destroy]. So I guess that generate the definition of the Vagrantfile only if a .gitlab.yml file is found could be a good approach.
2016-11-17T15:50:21 <amatas> what do you think?
2016-11-17T15:50:53 <gtirloni> makes sense. if the templates are within the plugin, changing how they work would simply be a `vagrant plugin update` away.. so it seems fine to me
2016-11-17T15:51:32 <gtirloni> people mentioned the need for offline development at some point.. i think i was concerned about that (if every `vagrant up` had to check a repository for templates, then that would require internet connection)
2016-11-17T15:51:55 <amatas> that\'s why I said this yesterday: https://botbot.me/freenode/fluid-tech/2016-11-16/?msg=76571209
2016-11-17T15:52:30 <amatas> mm, I see
2016-11-17T15:54:56 <amatas> anyway we use ansible roles to provision our vms, and most of them are fetched at boot time. So the internet connection is needed for now
2016-11-17T15:55:22 <amatas> for example the ansible-nodejs role
2016-11-17T15:56:56 <gtirloni> ah, good point
2016-11-17T15:56:57 <amatas> also, in the case of windows chocolatey checks and downloads new files to set up the development enviroment
2016-11-17T15:57:26 <gtirloni> so i guess the offline development requirement is really a no-go for us.. which makes sense
2016-11-17T15:57:41 <gtirloni> maybe one day :)
2016-11-17T15:58:02 <amatas> one day, when all the jira issues are solved....
2016-11-17T16:04:54 <amatas> also gtirloni did you have a chance to test the modsecurity packages?
2016-11-17T16:05:55 <gtirloni> not yet, sorry. but i will.. at most until tomorrow
2016-11-17T16:06:50 <amatas> ok ok, it\'s just that ping me if you need help.

2016-11-17T17:26:22 <gtirloni> amatas avtar: the issue on cindy\'s OSX machine is related to VirtualBox NAT
2016-11-17T17:26:40 <gtirloni> amatas avtar: it kills the connections (sends RST package) randomly
2016-11-17T17:26:56 <gtirloni> amatas avtar: when working with a bridged network, everything works fine (but vagrant doesn\'t like that)
2016-11-17T17:27:10 <gtirloni> we tried version 5.0.28 and now 5.1.8, same issue.
2016-11-17T17:27:32 <gtirloni> we removed a previous installation of vmware fusion that was not being used anymore, and cindyli is rebooting her computer now.. maybe there\'s a conflict with that

2016-11-17T17:38:36 <gtirloni> cindyli: ok. do you have more spare time to continue investigating this?
2016-11-17T17:41:26 <cindyli> sure, gtirloni

2016-11-17T18:04:43 <gtirloni> amatas avtar: our beloved virtualbox has a regression in 5.0.28 / 5.1.8
2016-11-17T18:04:58 <gtirloni> i installed 5.1.9 r111957 (test build) and it\'s working now
2016-11-17T18:05:43 <cindyli> gtirloni: thanks a lot for spending all these time looking up the solution.
2016-11-17T18:05:45 <cindyli> you are AWESOME!!
