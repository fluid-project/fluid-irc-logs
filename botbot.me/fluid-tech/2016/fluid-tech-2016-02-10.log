2016-02-10T21:42:25 <gtirloni> ok, i'll try that before opening any jira's. hopefully tomorrow morning

2016-02-10T11:42:30 <the-t-in-rtf> Are there any components that URL encode data?  @Bosmon
2016-02-10T11:43:07 <the-t-in-rtf> I have been using fluid.stringTemplate to create dynamic URLs and need to add protection against pieces with slashes, question marks, etc.
2016-02-10T11:44:54 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - this is done within kettle\'s dataSource
2016-02-10T11:45:17 <Bosmon> https://github.com/amb26/kettle/blob/KETTLE-32/lib/dataSource.js#L339
2016-02-10T12:30:27 <the-t-in-rtf> Great, thanks.
2016-02-10T12:38:14 <the-t-in-rtf> Does the model transformation rules system have any way to iterate over arrays of values?  @bosmon
2016-02-10T12:38:22 <the-t-in-rtf> I am digging through the tests now, but thought I\'d ask.
2016-02-10T12:38:46 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - there are some array transforms, yes
2016-02-10T12:38:50 <Bosmon> What would you like to do?
2016-02-10T12:39:12 <the-t-in-rtf> I am thinking of a set of rules to go from the "expanded" error format for JSON Schema validation to a digest.
2016-02-10T12:45:08 <the-t-in-rtf> I have been reading through the tests for the transformation functions for a bit and haven\'t quite figured out what I want.
2016-02-10T12:45:28 <the-t-in-rtf> To reduce it to the simplest example, say I have something like:
2016-02-10T12:46:05 <the-t-in-rtf> structure: { entries: [ { deep: "message" }] }
2016-02-10T12:46:11 <the-t-in-rtf> I want to end up with:
2016-02-10T12:46:31 <the-t-in-rtf> structure: { entries: ["message"] }
2016-02-10T12:46:41 <the-t-in-rtf> and there can of course be multiple objects in "entries"
2016-02-10T12:47:12 <the-t-in-rtf> @Bosmon
2016-02-10T12:47:16 <the-t-in-rtf> ^^^^
2016-02-10T13:07:38 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - why does "deep" go away in the above?
2016-02-10T13:11:35 <the-t-in-rtf> For example, I could be preparing a digest of a bunch of errors that will be displayed as a summary, perhaps in a bulleted list.
2016-02-10T13:11:58 <the-t-in-rtf> I may want to have a simpler template that only works with strings and which does not need to be aware of the deep structure of my error messages.
2016-02-10T13:12:42 <the-t-in-rtf> Really, my question is about addressing and iterating over deeper elements, I might even want to end up with ["message", "message2"] as the final output of the transformation.
2016-02-10T13:18:36 <the-t-in-rtf> Until now, we\'ve only received JSON structures that lack arrays, I could just as easily want to extract from a vendor\'s format and place the values in our own structure.
2016-02-10T13:18:46 <the-t-in-rtf> I could be pulling out available languages from a deep structure, for example.
2016-02-10T13:24:35 <the-t-in-rtf> If the question seems abstract, it\'s because I have used rules everywhere, and want to understand what options there are to handle arrays in general.

2016-02-10T19:09:44 <alanharnum> cindyli: whoops, you\'re right - missed that one - let me get it right now, sorry
2016-02-10T19:10:01 <cindyli> no worries, thanks, alanharnum
2016-02-10T19:12:40 <alanharnum> cindyli: addressed, thanks

2016-02-10T19:32:42 <Bosmon> cindyli - pull 11?
2016-02-10T19:32:52 <cindyli> yes, Bosmon
2016-02-10T19:34:29 <Bosmon> cindyli - I was wondering whether we could avoid committing both infusion and flocking as literal code here

2016-02-10T19:37:19 <cindyli1> ok, Bosmon, do you think that should be addressed in this pull or we create another jira to address?
2016-02-10T19:37:41 <Bosmon> cindyli - I\'d prefer it was addressed in this pull to keep junk out of the repo
2016-02-10T19:38:12 <Bosmon> It should be just a matter of adjusting package.json and the include paths
2016-02-10T19:39:13 * alanharnum joined the channel
2016-02-10T19:41:06 <alanharnum> Bosmon cindyli: there\'s an additional issue with sourcing things from NPM that I can foresee, which has to do with how the current http://build.fluidproject.org/ site is managed
2016-02-10T19:41:36 <alanharnum> basically, it assumes it can simply check out a repo to the right path and serve it as a static site
2016-02-10T19:42:08 <alanharnum> so build.fluidproject.org/chartAuthoring/ FE is just the result of cloning the repo at https://github.com/fluid-project/chartAuthoring
2016-02-10T19:42:17 <alanharnum> no steps in the deploy process that run npm install, etc
2016-02-10T19:42:19 <Bosmon> alanharnum - ah, interesting
2016-02-10T19:42:28 <Bosmon> That\'s a bit awkward
2016-02-10T19:43:02 <alanharnum> it\'s a more noticeable issue with chartAuthoring because of the dependencies on Flocking and D3
2016-02-10T19:43:40 <alanharnum> which I agree should ultimately be sourced via npm, but that requires more than just updating package.json if we want a proper end product for build.fluidproject.org
2016-02-10T19:43:44 * simonjb joined the channel
2016-02-10T19:45:04 <alanharnum> my concern right now regarding the time would be getting whatever work done on build.fluidproject.org as well as modifying the chartAuthoring repo itself
2016-02-10T19:45:15 <gtirloni> alanharnum: can we checkout the repo, run npm install on it and transfer the results?
2016-02-10T19:45:51 <alanharnum> gtirloni: yup - the main issue for me is tightness of time in the immediate moment
2016-02-10T19:46:33 <alanharnum> with the aim of getting http://build.fluidproject.org/chartAuthoring/demos/ updated with all the recent work by Friday
2016-02-10T19:46:59 <alanharnum> and giving myself enough time tomorrow/Friday to do a number of backed-up writing tasks for the ILDH/wiki
2016-02-10T19:48:07 <alanharnum> frankly, i\'m already worried about having enough time to do those to a sufficient level of quality in time for someone to review
2016-02-10T19:51:20 <alanharnum> we\'d also need colinclark to update the version of https://www.npmjs.com/package/flocking if we want to manage it as an external dependency via npm
2016-02-10T19:51:44 <colinclark> why, alanharnum?
2016-02-10T19:51:54 <colinclark> you can\'t use a git hash instead?
2016-02-10T19:52:09 <colinclark> i.e. "flocking": "colinbdclark/Flocking#xyz"
2016-02-10T19:52:10 * alanharnum has betrayed ignorance of npm
2016-02-10T19:52:15 <alanharnum> you\'re correct of course
2016-02-10T19:52:19 <alanharnum> scratch the last statement
2016-02-10T19:52:21 <colinclark> I mean, I definitely should release a new version of Flocking 0.2.0
2016-02-10T19:52:29 <colinclark> but not yet, I fear
2016-02-10T19:52:51 <cindyli> Bosmon, alanharnum, colinclark, another not-so-ideal option that will give us more time to work on this pull request is to temporarily make build.fluidproject.org to point to alanharnum\'s branch instead of the master for building the chart authoring demo site
2016-02-10T19:54:17 <Bosmon> Ok, if we are time-pressed, we can merge the branch as-is
2016-02-10T19:54:28 <Bosmon> I guess all the junk is going to get into the project history either way

2016-02-10T20:13:15 <cindyli> thanks, alanharnum
2016-02-10T20:29:04 <cindyli> alanharnum: i\'ve merged ur chart authoring pull request. thanks for the hard and awesome work. amazing to hear the chart speaking :)
2016-02-10T20:29:58 <alanharnum> cindyli: thanks cindyli - it\'s pretty exciting yeah. thank you (and Bosmon & colinclark) for all the excellent reviewing

2016-02-10T21:28:50 <gtirloni> no, i open the browser, cleared the cache, went to bluid.fluidproject.org, clicked on run all tests and watched it
2016-02-10T21:29:38 <Justin_o> :(
2016-02-10T21:30:15 <Justin_o> gtirloni: could you file JIRAs for all of those, i\'ll try to reproduce them.
