2016-04-21T14:50:21 <the-t-in-rtf> So, I have long had a use case where I used distributeOptions to give a parent component a chance to do something special with each of its descendants.
2016-04-21T14:50:40 <the-t-in-rtf> Namely giving routers a chance to add their child middleware to their routing stack.
2016-04-21T14:51:15 <the-t-in-rtf> The problem we\'ve had is that if you nest a grade within itself, you lose the ability to use a particular means of distributing functions.
2016-04-21T14:51:33 <the-t-in-rtf> Here\'s the meat of the distributeOptions block:
2016-04-21T14:52:49 <the-t-in-rtf> {
2016-04-21T14:52:49 <the-t-in-rtf> record: {
2016-04-21T14:52:49 <the-t-in-rtf> "funcName": "gpii.express.container.registerWithContainer",
2016-04-21T14:52:49 <the-t-in-rtf> "args": ["{arguments}.0", "{that}"] // direct child component, us.
2016-04-21T14:52:49 <the-t-in-rtf> },
2016-04-21T14:52:49 <the-t-in-rtf> target: "{that > gpii.express.middleware}.options.listeners.onReady"
2016-04-21T14:52:49 <the-t-in-rtf> }
2016-04-21T14:53:15 <the-t-in-rtf> If you use {that} in this example, you end up with the component you distributed it to rather than the {that} in the target.
2016-04-21T14:53:23 <the-t-in-rtf> You have to use a named grade to work around this, as in.
2016-04-21T14:53:53 <the-t-in-rtf> "args": ["{arguments}.0", "{gpii.express.container}"]
2016-04-21T14:54:13 <the-t-in-rtf> The problem is when a gpii.express.container instance has an immediate child that is also a gpii.express.container instance
2016-04-21T14:54:47 <the-t-in-rtf> instead of wiring the child ({arguments}.0) to the parent, we end up attempting to wire the child to the CHILD.
2016-04-21T14:55:16 <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. the fact that the child itself is a `gpii.express.container` results in it satisfying the IoC reference first.
2016-04-21T14:56:11 <the-t-in-rtf> To work around this, I moved away from using distributeOptions in favor of having each container inspect its own component options.
2016-04-21T14:56:57 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, I don\'t know if anyone has encountered a similar use case, just thought I\'d share.
2016-04-21T14:58:14 <the-t-in-rtf> I think this is down to needing to use `record` to bypass the restrictions on what you can distribute via the `source` option, as that content is interpreted in the context of the `target`.
2016-04-21T14:58:37 <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. of course the target will say "hey, I\'m a container" before looking any further.
2016-04-21T14:59:20 <the-t-in-rtf> Our previous approach was to only have a single instance of a named top-level grade, which could be cleanly referred to.
2016-04-21T15:00:37 <the-t-in-rtf> as in:
2016-04-21T15:01:05 <the-t-in-rtf> args: ["{arguments}.0", "{top.level.grade.of.doom}"] // the child, the completely unique ancestor
2016-04-21T15:02:09 <the-t-in-rtf> even though the child is still evaluating the reference, it can pick up the single instance of the named grade from its ancestry.
2016-04-21T15:02:43 <the-t-in-rtf> where it couldn\'t possibly sensibly figure out that {that} or {gpii.express.container} refers to someone else.
