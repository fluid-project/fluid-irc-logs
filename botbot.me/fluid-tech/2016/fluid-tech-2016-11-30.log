2016-11-30T14:56:51 <amatas> gtirloni, avtar, alanharnum are we going to make the ops meeting today? Sandra told me that she wants to attend as well.
2016-11-30T14:57:31 <avtar> amatas: sounds good
2016-11-30T14:57:32 <alanharnum> amatas: I wasn't aware it was today, but it's entirely possible i missed the invite
2016-11-30T14:57:55 <colinclark> Did we have to cancel Monday's meeting because of the (also cancelled) interview, amatas?
2016-11-30T14:57:55 <avtar> gloob, colinclark: will you be able to attend?
2016-11-30T14:58:02 <colinclark> It depends on when
2016-11-30T14:58:06 <colinclark> When are we thinking
2016-11-30T14:58:08 <colinclark> more details please :)
2016-11-30T14:58:42 <amatas> alanharnum, I don't remember if we decided a final date
2016-11-30T14:59:18 <amatas> but, could all of you meet in 5 min or so? (before the APCP meeting)
2016-11-30T14:59:20 <avtar> colinclark: i believe it was rescheduled to today due to a meeting conflict that amatas had with sandra
2016-11-30T15:00:03 <colinclark> ah, I see
2016-11-30T15:00:13 <alanharnum> i'm free
2016-11-30T15:01:33 * michelled joined the channel
2016-11-30T15:02:01 <avtar> amatas: i think gtirloni is afk for lunch at the moment
2016-11-30T15:02:21 <avtar> we may want to wait for him
2016-11-30T15:02:48 <gtirloni> sorry, back
2016-11-30T15:03:14 <alanharnum> GTIRLONI HOW DARE YOU EAT FOOD
2016-11-30T15:03:24 <gtirloni> lol
2016-11-30T15:03:25 <amatas> don't worry gtirloni you can finish your lunch
2016-11-30T15:03:27 <alanharnum> you know you're supposed to consume soylent paste at your terminal like the rest of us
2016-11-30T15:03:38 <amatas> haha
2016-11-30T15:03:41 <avtar> alanharnum: :(
2016-11-30T15:04:16 <colinclark> I'm a bit concerned about doing this short notice
2016-11-30T15:04:28 <colinclark> I'm up for it, though several of us have a meeting in 50 minutes
2016-11-30T15:04:43 <colinclark> but I'd like for us to get a little bit better at scheduling these things and communicating them ;)
2016-11-30T15:04:45 <amatas> I'm free this hour
2016-11-30T15:04:57 <avtar> colinclark: that's fair
2016-11-30T15:05:11 <alanharnum> i'm good for all of tomorrow if we'd like to schedule for then so people have more notice
2016-11-30T15:05:16 <gtirloni> we have it at our regular schedule next monday, if that's okay
2016-11-30T15:05:32 <colinclark> yes, definitely
2016-11-30T15:05:36 <colinclark> let's keep that time slot free
2016-11-30T15:05:40 <avtar> gtirloni: +1
2016-11-30T15:05:47 <colinclark> and if we need to, remind Sandra not to book meetings or interviews at that time too :)
2016-11-30T15:06:03 <colinclark> but the question is, what about this week?
2016-11-30T15:06:07 <colinclark> Do we want to meet up for a few minutes now?
2016-11-30T15:06:12 <colinclark> how's that lunch, gtirloni?
2016-11-30T15:06:24 <amatas> now works for me
