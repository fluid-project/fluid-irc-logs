b'2016-12-05T18:35:15 <gtirloni> amatas: we may have to name the plugin "vagrant-gpii-ci" (if the ones here are any indication there\'s a pattern -- https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/wiki/Available-Vagrant-Plugins)
2016-12-05T18:35:57 <gtirloni> amatas: do we have to follow up with Hashicorp to have the plugin accepted?
2016-12-05T18:36:15 <gtirloni> amatas: i was wondering how `vagrant plugin add` knows where to look for a plugin

2016-12-05T14:32:23 <michelled> the agenda is here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/12QO6eiYQe3FK7pL01KTOMKse0sFmuXSv058HSp5qiTo/edit
2016-12-05T14:32:44 <michelled> but we can\'t see the chat in the meeting room, so please message us in  the irc room instead
2016-12-05T14:32:51 <clown> thanks michelled.  I just started going thru old emaile to find that agenda.
2016-12-05T14:32:57 <clown> *email
2016-12-05T14:33:11 <clown> now, I don\'t have to \xe2\x80\x94 there\'s the URL, thanks again.
2016-12-05T14:33:18 <michelled> np :)
2016-12-05T14:36:33 <michelled> amatas: we can\'t hear you
2016-12-05T14:36:40 <michelled> can you try talking?
2016-12-05T14:37:05 <amatas> sorry I was AFK for a sec
2016-12-05T14:37:12 <amatas> could you repeat the question?
2016-12-05T14:37:33 <avtar> amatas: the-t-in-rtf1 was asking if your vagrant-vmenv work supports windows VMs
2016-12-05T14:38:35 <amatas> ok, vagrant-vmenv uses ansible commands inside the VMs to provision and launch the tests, so you can spin up a Windows VM but you will not able to provision and launch the tests with the actual code.
2016-12-05T14:40:40 <michelled> fluid-everyone: here\'s the pad we are taking notes in: https://pad.gpii.net/p/201612-washingtonf2f-ih1b4nns
2016-12-05T14:40:43 <michelled> cindyli: ^
2016-12-05T14:40:50 <cindyli> thanks
2016-12-05T14:44:38 <amatas> ok michelled, sorry, I didn\'t realize of that, as Tony was pasting the links in the Gotomeeting chat
2016-12-05T14:48:57 <michelled> Bosmon5, the-t-in-rtf1: https://pad.gpii.net/p/201612-washingtonf2f-ih1b4nns
2016-12-05T14:54:01 <avtar> the-t-in-rtf1: could you please confirm that you\'ve switched over to amatas\' .qi.yml config for all your repos?
2016-12-05T14:54:19 <the-t-in-rtf1> I have not done so for all of them.
2016-12-05T14:54:26 <the-t-in-rtf1> I will do so once we get one working\xe2\x80\xa6 ;)
2016-12-05T14:54:44 <the-t-in-rtf1> I think I pushed it through to at least half though.
2016-12-05T14:55:14 <avtar> working with jenkins you mean?
2016-12-05T14:55:20 <the-t-in-rtf1> yes
2016-12-05T14:57:31 <avtar> the-t-in-rtf1: ok, because it\'s a matter of getting jenkins to set up environments using amatas\' vagrant-vmenv which i can do this morning
2016-12-05T14:57:46 <the-t-in-rtf1> Looks like I\'ve pushed it through to gpii-express, gpii-express-user, gpii-pouchdb-lucene, and gpii-webdriver
2016-12-05T14:58:01 <avtar> that means jenkins will start using it for all of your repos it\'s configured to monitor
2016-12-05T14:58:03 <the-t-in-rtf1> I can certainly do the rest in the morning.
2016-12-05T14:58:42 <gtirloni> alanharnum avtar amatas gloob: should we have the gpii infra meeting today?
2016-12-05T14:59:21 <avtar> gtirloni: i think we should
2016-12-05T14:59:50 <avtar> but maybe we should reschedule for a later time so that it coincides with the f2f lunch break?
2016-12-05T15:00:27 * jessm joined the channel
2016-12-05T15:00:43 <gtirloni> that works for me (it\'s 1pm here already)
2016-12-05T15:00:44 <avtar> looks like that\'s in an hour from now and the next f2f topic starts at 4:00
2016-12-05T15:01:59 <amatas> gtirloni, avtar one hour from now works for me as well
2016-12-05T15:02:09 <michelled> alanharn_: we are talking about IoC testing right now, in case you are interested
2016-12-05T15:02:34 <alanharn_> michelled: thanks - hopping on
2016-12-05T15:03:05 <michelled> alanharn_: you can catch up in the notes: https://pad.gpii.net/p/201612-washingtonf2f-ih1b4nns
2016-12-05T15:13:07 * alanharn_ is now known as alanharnum_2
2016-12-05T15:19:09 <the-t-in-rtf1> @avtar, in the background I am trying alfredo\'s work locally with the repos that don\'t already use it.
2016-12-05T15:21:39 <the-t-in-rtf1> muting to avoid sharing the jet-engine noises that result from running vagrant
2016-12-05T15:24:09 <gloob> gtirloni: just saw your comments about AWS thing
2016-12-05T15:24:35 <gloob> gtirloni: thanks for popping up, let\'s see how we can plan that
2016-12-05T15:27:13 * simonjb joined the channel
2016-12-05T15:31:56 <amatas> the-t-in-rtf1: I\'m just curious, how much time does vagrant take to spin up the environment on your local machine?
2016-12-05T15:32:29 <the-t-in-rtf1> usually a couple of minutes.
2016-12-05T15:33:12 <the-t-in-rtf1> already finished one conversion and working on another, so it can\'t have taken more than five minutes.
2016-12-05T15:33:16 <the-t-in-rtf1> ;)
2016-12-05T15:33:32 <amatas> ok, thanks
2016-12-05T15:34:54 <amatas> I\'m have been thinking on how to reduce that time.
2016-12-05T15:39:49 <the-t-in-rtf1> I just started a new pass with "time", so I\'ll have a better estimate shortly.
2016-12-05T15:40:55 <amatas> awesome

2016-12-05T16:01:59 <amatas> mmm, that is the time of spin up the vm and provision, right?
2016-12-05T16:03:38 <the-t-in-rtf1> that\'s everything including running the tests.
2016-12-05T16:04:08 <the-t-in-rtf1> I had multiple vms running, I got closer to 2.5 minutes in another run.
2016-12-05T16:05:19 <the-t-in-rtf1> misread that.  2:58

2016-12-05T16:20:31 <gtirloni> i\'m fine meeting any time
2016-12-05T16:20:51 <gtirloni> are people having food already?
2016-12-05T16:21:03 <michelled> I can let you know in here when we are onto another topic, if you\'d like
2016-12-05T16:21:28 <avtar> gtirloni: not yet
2016-12-05T16:23:53 <alanharnum_2> the browser singularity approaches closer: https://browsix.org/

2016-12-05T17:46:18 <michelled> we are about to start up avtar, but we are doing an exercise
2016-12-05T17:46:29 <michelled> probably not useful to listen in right now?
2016-12-05T17:46:33 <avtar> there is a "Refactoring Build Scripts for Windows Repository" agenda item on the f2f pad that came up during the infra call with amatas, alanharnum, gtirloni, and me
2016-12-05T17:46:42 <avtar> wondering if that item will be tackled today or later at some point
2016-12-05T17:46:50 <michelled> not likely today :)
2016-12-05T17:47:05 <avtar> ok cool
2016-12-05T17:50:32 <the-t-in-rtf> Hey, @avtar, @amatas, I\'m updating the last build now in between evening chores, just wanted to ask
2016-12-05T17:50:45 <the-t-in-rtf> Is this configuration block still supported with Alfredo\'s work?
2016-12-05T17:50:46 <the-t-in-rtf> publishers:
2016-12-05T17:50:46 <the-t-in-rtf> - cobertura:
2016-12-05T17:50:46 <the-t-in-rtf> report-file: "coverage/cobertura-coverage.xml"
2016-12-05T17:54:52 <amatas> the-t-in-rtf, I\'m afraid that the \'publishers\' statement is ignored by now.
2016-12-05T17:56:13 <amatas> BUT, you can add a command that do almost the same to the "test_cmds:" list
2016-12-05T17:56:55 * David123_ joined the channel
2016-12-05T17:57:31 <avtar> amatas: the config in question is jenkins related though http://docs.openstack.org/infra/jenkins-job-builder/publishers.html#publishers.cobertura
2016-12-05T17:59:02 <avtar> it instructs jenkins to expect and consume code coverage reports for that project
2016-12-05T17:59:55 <amatas> oh I see
2016-12-05T18:02:05 <avtar> somewhat related: https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/user/project/pipelines/settings.html#test-coverage-parsing
2016-12-05T18:02:14 <avtar> https://www.stefanwienert.de/images/blog/2015/gitlab/gitlab-testcoverage.png
2016-12-05T18:04:34 <avtar> looks like javascript support will be making its way in at some point https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/5052
2016-12-05T18:14:13 <avtar> my mistake, it looks like that merge request is just to publish the gitlab community edition front end code coverage reports
2016-12-05T18:15:12 <avtar> looks like using something like istanbul should be possible as-is https://github.com/Lingvokot/gitlab-ci-scripts/blob/master/README.md#unrelated-notes-on-gitlab-ci-setup
