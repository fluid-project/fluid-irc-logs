2016-04-25T15:04:18 <the-t-in-rtf1> I was working with kettle.loadTestingSupport() and comparable functions in my own packages.
2016-04-25T15:04:38 <the-t-in-rtf1> It seems to cause problems when I want to do things like run a test harness (instance of express) for manual QA.
2016-04-25T15:05:08 <the-t-in-rtf1> Something in kettle.loadTestingSupport() seems to kick off an instance of jqUnit that will destroy everything and complain about not having run any tests.
2016-04-25T15:05:32 <the-t-in-rtf1> @Bosmon ^^^^
2016-04-25T15:06:13 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf1 - yes, it does
2016-04-25T15:06:17 <Bosmon> Are you not planning to run any tests?
2016-04-25T15:06:22 <the-t-in-rtf1> In this case, no.
2016-04-25T15:06:26 <Bosmon> And what\'s this about "destroying everything"?
2016-04-25T15:06:37 <the-t-in-rtf1> This is the launch-test-harness.js convenience script I use often.
2016-04-25T15:06:38 <Bosmon> Ah, I guess you mean in the opposite order
2016-04-25T15:06:46 <Bosmon> It will complain about not having run any tests and THEN destroy everything :)
2016-04-25T15:06:47 <the-t-in-rtf1> yes.
2016-04-25T15:06:51 <the-t-in-rtf1> that is correct
2016-04-25T15:06:57 <Bosmon> ok
2016-04-25T15:07:09 <Bosmon> Yes, this behaviour was sadly incorporated explicitly
2016-04-25T15:07:35 <Bosmon> To deal with the case where a test run appeared to silently do nothing as a result of a failure in an uncaught exception handler or some other piece of setup
2016-04-25T15:07:36 <the-t-in-rtf1> my current workaround is to require the specific fixture, which does not itself require node-jqunit.
2016-04-25T15:07:56 <Bosmon> Ok
2016-04-25T15:08:13 <Bosmon> So can you outline why you would like to run kettle.loadTestingSupport() when you do not intend to run any tests?
2016-04-25T15:08:15 <the-t-in-rtf1> that results in lines like require(fluid.module.resolvePath("gpii-ul-api/tests/js/lib/test-harness.js")
2016-04-25T15:08:53 <the-t-in-rtf1> Basically, if any of the things required when using loadTestingSupport use jqunit, then I can\'t use them in manual testing.
2016-04-25T15:09:14 <the-t-in-rtf1> So, I have required a bunch of stuff, including the harness (express instance) in my loadTestingSupport functions in various packages.
2016-04-25T15:09:23 <Bosmon> I am repeating the line you have just written to myself out load repeatedly
2016-04-25T15:09:36 <Bosmon> To see if I can force it into delivered meaning : P
2016-04-25T15:09:43 <Bosmon> "Basically, if any of the things required when using loadTestingSupport use jqunit, then I can\'t use them in manual testing."
2016-04-25T15:09:53 <Bosmon> I have repeated it 3 or 4 times now
2016-04-25T15:10:12 <Bosmon> if ..... then ......
2016-04-25T15:10:13 <the-t-in-rtf1> manual testing meaning, to launch something that I will test myself (using postman or the like)
2016-04-25T15:10:22 <Bosmon> IF THEY USE ....
2016-04-25T15:10:30 <the-t-in-rtf1> those things are far away
2016-04-25T15:10:32 <Bosmon> !!
2016-04-25T15:10:57 <the-t-in-rtf1> that was a Father Ted reference inserted just to make sure you were paying attention.
2016-04-25T15:10:59 <Bosmon> yes
2016-04-25T15:11:15 <Bosmon> Manual testing
2016-04-25T15:11:16 <Bosmon> Ok
2016-04-25T15:11:23 <Bosmon> I can ask a CLARIFYING QUESTION
2016-04-25T15:11:42 <Bosmon> WHAT KINDS OF THINGS that you might want to use during manual testing, are the kinds of things which loadTestingSupport loads?
2016-04-25T15:11:59 <the-t-in-rtf1> specifically the "harness" grades I make, which are instances of gpii.express
2016-04-25T15:12:05 <the-t-in-rtf1> those are really the only things.
2016-04-25T15:12:10 <Bosmon> I see
2016-04-25T15:12:19 <Bosmon> So those are all your own things
2016-04-25T15:12:38 <Bosmon> It suggests to me that they need to be factored out into a separate area of gpii-express
2016-04-25T15:12:46 <the-t-in-rtf1> Meh.
2016-04-25T15:12:54 <Bosmon> Unless they themselves depend on things which are only loaded via kettle.loadTestingSupport?
2016-04-25T15:12:57 <the-t-in-rtf1> I\'d rather hit them using package relative paths as needed.
2016-04-25T15:13:06 <the-t-in-rtf1> it\'s the reuse of the PATTERN that is the problem.
2016-04-25T15:13:14 <the-t-in-rtf1> I do the same thing in my own loadTestingSupport methods.
2016-04-25T15:13:15 <Bosmon> Well, to me, this suggests that you need a new primitive
2016-04-25T15:13:24 <Bosmon> That you might call "loadTestingHarnessSupport" or so
2016-04-25T15:13:41 <the-t-in-rtf1> yes, as I just said, I would rather just stick to loading just the harness using a package-relative path for now.
2016-04-25T15:13:42 <Bosmon> Or else just stick them in main gpii-express
2016-04-25T15:13:58 <Bosmon> ok
2016-04-25T15:14:03 <the-t-in-rtf1> I actually *like* the behavior of telling me to stuff it if I don\'t run any tests, in general.
2016-04-25T15:14:19 <the-t-in-rtf1> it often shows me when I have miswired my caseholder, for example.
2016-04-25T15:14:31 <the-t-in-rtf1> and in that case is usefully accurate
2016-04-25T15:14:42 <Bosmon> You can also say fluid.require("%gpii-ul-api/tests/js/lib/test-harness.js")
2016-04-25T15:14:47 <Bosmon> Yes
2016-04-25T15:14:51 <the-t-in-rtf1> Yes, I mentioned that repeatedly
2016-04-25T15:14:53 <Bosmon> That was the case it was designed to diagnose
2016-04-25T15:15:03 <Bosmon> What did you mention repeatedly?
2016-04-25T15:15:14 <the-t-in-rtf1> "I\'d rather hit them using package relative paths as needed."
2016-04-25T15:15:16 <Bosmon> Yes
2016-04-25T15:15:24 <Bosmon> Note that what I wrote was a little different to waht you wrote
2016-04-25T15:15:25 <the-t-in-rtf1> "that results in lines like require(fluid.module.resolvePath("gpii-ul-api/tests/js/lib/test-harness.js")"
2016-04-25T15:15:28 <Bosmon> It was just a helpful suggestion
2016-04-25T15:15:30 <the-t-in-rtf1> ahhhhhhhh
2016-04-25T15:15:33 <the-t-in-rtf1> I SEE IT NOW
2016-04-25T15:15:36 <the-t-in-rtf1> thanks, and sorry.
2016-04-25T15:15:56 <the-t-in-rtf1> I meant to ask you about that as well, thanks for as usual interpreting a sane answer to my muddle questions.
2016-04-25T15:16:19 <Bosmon> The "loadXxxxSupport" pattern certainly isn\'t idea
2016-04-25T15:16:21 <Bosmon> ideal
2016-04-25T15:16:30 <Bosmon> It\'s sort of an "evolved" solution to an annoying problem
2016-04-25T15:17:03 <the-t-in-rtf1> I am happy for my implementations to be problematic in exactly the same way as every other instance.
2016-04-25T15:17:10 <Bosmon> One "principled" solution might involve a rather more enhanced module loader, together with some more finely factored "micro-modules" together with some extended material in package.json
2016-04-25T15:17:21 * clown has quit
2016-04-25T15:17:24 <Bosmon> Compared to this, the loadXxxxSupport pattern seems to involve a whole heap less trouble
2016-04-25T15:17:54 <the-t-in-rtf1> I don\'t suppose you could make it the job of the testEnvironment to call people out on this without letting raw jqUnit tests escape.
2016-04-25T15:18:08 <Bosmon> But yes, it is there precisely because of the strange side-effects that loading jqUnit invariably has
2016-04-25T15:18:28 <Bosmon> The problem is that the failure may occur even before you\'ve succeeded in constructing a testEnvironment
2016-04-25T15:18:52 <Bosmon> Unfortunately test cases are things with a somewhat leaky mission
2016-04-25T15:19:18 <the-t-in-rtf1> I think early on I tried making people pass in jqUnit to the helper functions.
2016-04-25T15:19:28 <the-t-in-rtf1> So those libraries could be safely required without instantiating jqUnit.
2016-04-25T15:19:36 <Bosmon> In this case it is far more important that a perhaps less technical person running tests is NEVER presented with what looks like a false positive that lets them imagine that tests have passed when they haven\'t
2016-04-25T15:19:43 <the-t-in-rtf1> yes, agreed.
2016-04-25T15:21:38 * clown joined the channel
2016-04-25T15:21:59 <Bosmon> The "principled" answer to these problems invariably requires making more numerous, and smaller, modules
2016-04-25T15:22:15 <Bosmon> As the xkcd cartoon on standards has it, "Now you have n+1 problems"
2016-04-25T15:22:25 <Bosmon> Or "n+m" for some large m : P
2016-04-25T15:23:35 <the-t-in-rtf1> He did a variation on that for regexps, which I regularly quote
2016-04-25T15:23:38 <the-t-in-rtf1> or was it perl?
2016-04-25T15:23:43 <the-t-in-rtf1> Anyway:  https://github.com/the-t-in-rtf/gpii-express/blob/GPII-1682/src/js/router.js#L29
2016-04-25T15:24:15 <the-t-in-rtf1> I found a reasonable place to add a "wrapper" function for the stock routers, that provides the same additional information as we previous added to middleware.
2016-04-25T15:24:44 <Bosmon> Very good
2016-04-25T15:24:48 <the-t-in-rtf1> https://xkcd.com/1171/
2016-04-25T15:24:51 <the-t-in-rtf1> That\'s the one.
2016-04-25T15:25:07 <the-t-in-rtf1> It was actually both.
2016-04-25T15:25:20 <Bosmon> Yes
2016-04-25T15:25:44 * cindyli has quit
2016-04-25T15:25:53 <Bosmon> Sadly noone in npm ever seems to imagine that anyone will come up to them with the problem "I have too many modules"
2016-04-25T15:26:09 <Bosmon> I guess there\'s a legendary analogous CS jape
2016-04-25T15:26:30 <Bosmon> "Any problem can be solved by adding another layer of indirection - unless your problem is having too many layers of indirection"
2016-04-25T15:27:31 <the-t-in-rtf1> HA
2016-04-25T15:28:03 <the-t-in-rtf1> I noticed today that a sub-package did not install infusion in its node_modules, even though it was a normal dependency.
2016-04-25T15:28:43 <the-t-in-rtf1> I wondered if it was something you had managed, or a rare instance of npm managing not to clutter things up with deep copies of top-level deps.
2016-04-25T15:28:51 <Bosmon> You\'re not using npm 3 by any chance?
2016-04-25T15:28:57 <Bosmon> That\'s the kind of trick it will do
2016-04-25T15:29:01 <the-t-in-rtf1> nope, 2.14.7
2016-04-25T15:29:12 <Bosmon> That should be impossible
2016-04-25T15:29:31 <the-t-in-rtf1> Yes, I was taken aback.
2016-04-25T15:29:34 <Bosmon> oh wait
2016-04-25T15:29:50 <Bosmon> It\'s not impossible if i) the dep is source from npm, ii) the version exactly matches one higher up the tree
2016-04-25T15:30:05 <Bosmon> This is the "natural deduping" which npm was always meant to do

2016-04-25T15:44:28 <the-t-in-rtf1> it is very odd because I often use exactly the same version, from source in a whole chain, and still end up with dupes.
2016-04-25T15:44:35 <the-t-in-rtf1> There must be an intermediate level that lacks the dep.
