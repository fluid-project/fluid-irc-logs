2016-06-23T14:58:38 <colinclark> alanharnum: I put a comment on the Chart Authoring pull request
2016-06-23T14:59:01 <colinclark> As of 1 am last night, I had a mostly-working branch, but some odd test failures that I needed to investigate more closely
2016-06-23T15:01:11 <alanharnum> colinclark: odd test failures in Flocking, or Chart Authoring?
2016-06-23T15:01:40 <colinclark> CA
2016-06-23T15:03:44 <colinclark> It\'s amazing how much thought this issue really took
2016-06-23T15:03:58 <colinclark> and there are things to improve in both Infusion and Flocking
2016-06-23T15:04:01 <colinclark> but I think this should be workable

2016-06-23T20:53:16 <colinclark> michelled: Your work on the GPII electron application is going to be pretty interesting
2016-06-23T20:53:29 <colinclark> You have a classic "legacy system" scenario to make some decisions about
2016-06-23T20:53:47 <colinclark> The first option is to take the code you\'ve got and treat it like any other legacy codebase that you want to refactor
2016-06-23T20:53:51 <colinclark> since you have no tests right now
2016-06-23T20:54:30 <colinclark> I guess the key in those situations is to know how to manually test it
2016-06-23T20:54:52 <colinclark> so you can make initial changes to the point of being able to write some unit tests for a little corner of it :)
2016-06-23T20:55:19 <colinclark> It seems to me that you\'re going to need to start by upgrade to the latest version of the GPII
2016-06-23T20:55:21 <michelled> I was hoping to start by writing some tests for it and then refactoring it out
2016-06-23T20:55:29 <colinclark> which may explode massively
2016-06-23T20:55:30 <michelled> but perhaps that isn\'t the best strategy
2016-06-23T20:55:47 <colinclark> there is no point, I think, in doing anything with it until it builds and runs again master
2016-06-23T20:55:52 <colinclark> I think :)
2016-06-23T20:55:57 <michelled> fair enough :)
2016-06-23T20:56:17 <colinclark> my impression is that if you can get it working without a ton of effort, then your strategy is sound
2016-06-23T20:56:23 <colinclark> test it bit by bit
2016-06-23T20:56:32 <colinclark> but if you find a whole lot of flames when you upgrade
2016-06-23T20:56:44 <colinclark> then you might want to consider the alternative strategy for legacy systems
2016-06-23T20:58:10 <colinclark> that is, starting again :)
2016-06-23T20:58:18 <michelled> I was contemplating that today
2016-06-23T20:58:29 <michelled> was hoping to catch hens to chat today
2016-06-23T20:58:36 <colinclark> hard to know what the right strategy is
2016-06-23T20:58:47 <colinclark> but why not try updating versions and seeing what kinds of chaos ensues
2016-06-23T20:58:52 <colinclark> either of the kind we want, or otherwise
2016-06-23T20:59:19 <colinclark> The version of Electron he\'s using is also quite out of date
2016-06-23T20:59:51 <colinclark> Electron releases super fast
2016-06-23T21:00:00 <colinclark> so ordinarily it seems cool to be out of date
2016-06-23T21:00:10 <colinclark> but I believe they cut a 1.0 release relatively recently
2016-06-23T21:00:12 <colinclark> but start with GPII
2016-06-23T21:00:24 <colinclark> who knows, you may find it\'s totally seamless
2016-06-23T21:01:00 <colinclark> you can ditch the dedupe-infusion dependency and script in package.json
2016-06-23T21:01:14 <colinclark> probably pin your dependencies against a particular version
2016-06-23T21:01:30 <colinclark> and update universal and windows to the latest master branch hash
2016-06-23T21:03:47 <michelled> that makes sense colinclark - I\'ll try it out
2016-06-23T21:03:49 <michelled> thanks!
2016-06-23T21:03:59 <colinclark> it\'ll be pretty interesting
2016-06-23T21:04:13 <colinclark> the one thing you are missing with this repository is the rest of our continuous integration infrastructure
