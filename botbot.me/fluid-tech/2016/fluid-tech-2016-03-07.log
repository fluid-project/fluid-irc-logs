2016-03-07T15:44:59 <simonjb> avtar: thanks for the note on nodejs_version -- I've updated the config and the Jenkins build is happy again
2016-03-07T15:45:05 <simonjb> https://ci-int.gpii.net/job/nexus-tests/10/
2016-03-07T15:45:21 <simonjb> and vagrant up now runs successfully on my local machine
2016-03-07T15:45:46 <simonjb> the web hook is working also
2016-03-07T15:45:54 <simonjb> so, I think we are good again
2016-03-07T15:45:59 <simonjb> thanks for your help!
2016-03-07T15:46:32 <simonjb> at some point we will move the build to GPII/nexus once my code is merged
2016-03-07T15:53:07 <avtar> simonjb: i'm glad order has been restored :)
