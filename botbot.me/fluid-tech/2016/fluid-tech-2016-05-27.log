2016-05-27T19:30:44 <colinclark_> gtirloni: Interesting
2016-05-27T19:30:49 <colinclark_> so like, weeks worth of work?
2016-05-27T19:31:21 <gtirloni> i think so, a week is a fair estimation
2016-05-27T19:32:31 <gtirloni> the commercial rules cost $495 monies per year.. we'd need a two for a production deployment, if we decide to use those
2016-05-27T19:33:06 <colinclark_> I think it's justifiable within APCP if we think we can reuse the rules for other apps, too
2016-05-27T19:33:32 <gtirloni> anything behind the load balancers could be protected by them so yep, reusable for sure

2016-05-27T16:50:18 <colinclark> gtirloni, avtar: So how come ci.gpii.net doesn\'t show builds after my merge last night of universal and linux and windows?
2016-05-27T16:58:34 <gtirloni> those builds are tied to the windows and linux repositories
2016-05-27T16:59:11 <gtirloni> ah, i see you had commits to them.. (i was thinking only universal had had commits)
2016-05-27T16:59:39 <gtirloni> now we must engage in the painful process of asking how are the webhook configured in the GPII repositories :)
2016-05-27T17:05:09 <gtirloni> yesterday when you merged changes to gpii/universal.. i can see we automatically rebuilt the universal docker image
2016-05-27T17:05:16 <gtirloni> so the webhooks for that repo must be right
2016-05-27T17:05:22 <gtirloni> we need to check gpii/linux and gpii/windows
2016-05-27T17:07:12 <avtar> colinclark, gtirloni: sorry, was afk
2016-05-27T17:08:48 <avtar> colinclark: could you share what url you  see when in gpii/window\'s \'jenkins hook url\' field?
2016-05-27T17:09:17 <avtar> it\'ll be listed in the \'Jenkins (GitHub plugin)\' settings
2016-05-27T17:10:31 * alanharnum joined the channel
2016-05-27T17:25:18 <colinclark> yes sorry
2016-05-27T17:25:23 <colinclark> i\'m just seeing this now
2016-05-27T17:25:32 <colinclark> by the way, avtar, I have good and I have bad news
2016-05-27T17:25:51 <colinclark> I can at least confirm that the Windows repository unit tests pass on Windows 7 correctly
2016-05-27T17:26:01 <colinclark> it looks like the acceptance tests require JAWS
2016-05-27T17:26:10 <colinclark> Is that part of your Vagrant provisioning?
2016-05-27T17:26:55 <colinclark> gtirloni, avtar: it seems there is no longer any service hook at all
2016-05-27T17:27:09 <colinclark> just this webhook: http://issues.gpii.net/rest/bitbucket/1.0/repository/11/sync (push)
2016-05-27T17:27:13 <colinclark> but no jenkins service connected
2016-05-27T17:27:18 <gtirloni> that explains it
2016-05-27T17:27:41 <colinclark> the issues.gpii one is also maybe failing?
2016-05-27T17:27:49 <colinclark> is it correct?
2016-05-27T17:28:03 <gtirloni> i think that\'s used for updating JIRAs automatically
2016-05-27T17:28:41 <avtar> colinclark: no, we\'ve only been running the built in ones https://github.com/GPII/ci-service/blob/master/jenkins_jobs/windows.yml#L90 i believe kasper has an issue assigned to possibly silo to install jaws, nvda, and other ATs using powershell scripts
2016-05-27T17:28:49 <colinclark> looks like maybe it\'s been having trouble since 2015, gtirloni
2016-05-27T17:29:01 <colinclark> aha
2016-05-27T17:29:19 <colinclark> avtar: thanks, i didn\'t know about the flag
2016-05-27T17:29:25 <colinclark> it\'s not documented in the README
2016-05-27T17:29:56 <colinclark> ok, rousing success
2016-05-27T17:29:57 <gtirloni> for jenkins you\'ll need to add a webhook for "Jenkins (GitHub plugin)" with the following URL: https://ci-int.gpii.net/github-webhook/
2016-05-27T17:30:08 <colinclark> on it, gtirloni
2016-05-27T17:30:13 <gtirloni> thanks :)
2016-05-27T17:30:27 <gtirloni> i don\'t know much about the jira integration, i think justin may have worked on setting that up
2016-05-27T17:31:16 <colinclark> ok, windows is set up and I tested the hook
2016-05-27T17:31:18 <colinclark> it seems to work
2016-05-27T17:32:30 <colinclark> linux now too, gtirloni
2016-05-27T17:35:13 <gtirloni> cool :) we should be able to know for sure on the next commit. i think the \'test service\' button sends a no-op ping.. it doesnt\' trigger the job
2016-05-27T17:38:22 <colinclark> can we manually trigger the jobs?
2016-05-27T17:38:36 <colinclark> i do have a pull requst of javi\'s i should probably merge
2016-05-27T17:38:38 <colinclark> which would trigger
2016-05-27T17:39:48 <gtirloni> ah sure, just triggered the linux one
2016-05-27T17:40:06 <gtirloni> and the windows too
2016-05-27T17:48:30 <colinclark> thanks!

2016-05-27T18:29:31 <gtirloni> linux finished ok. there were some issues with windows (chrome/node install i think). not sure it\'s related to what avtar is currently working on though
2016-05-27T18:29:50 * Justin_o has quit
2016-05-27T18:30:31 <colinclark> gtirloni: How come I don\'t see that reflected on the page?
2016-05-27T18:30:43 <colinclark> windows definitely is failing, that\'s ok
2016-05-27T18:32:35 <gtirloni> the static website is being updated every 5min.. i think we had it at 2min before, lemme change that too
2016-05-27T18:33:38 <colinclark> ok, now I\'m seeing the Windows failure
2016-05-27T18:33:39 <colinclark> a nice red ball
2016-05-27T18:33:41 <colinclark> which seems apt

2016-05-27T19:01:02 <colinclark> hey avtar, how come it looks like the windows-unit-tests didn\'t retrigger?
2016-05-27T19:01:30 <colinclark> i guess it must be because the prerequisite failed
2016-05-27T19:01:35 <colinclark> i.e. windows-build
2016-05-27T19:01:38 <colinclark> is that right?
2016-05-27T19:01:43 <avtar> colinclark: yup
2016-05-27T19:01:47 <colinclark> cool
2016-05-27T19:03:45 <colinclark> one more question, avtar
2016-05-27T19:03:50 <colinclark> how come I can\'t see the output of this one: https://ci.gpii.net/job/windows-unit-tests/lastBuild.1.html
2016-05-27T19:04:01 <colinclark> usually there\'s a "view as plain text" link where I can see all the output
2016-05-27T19:04:49 <avtar> colinclark: only after clicking on the \'console output\' link
2016-05-27T19:04:56 <avtar> on the left
2016-05-27T19:07:03 <colinclark> oh interesting
2016-05-27T19:07:11 <colinclark> in other cases, if I click that link I get a 404
2016-05-27T19:07:53 <avtar> hmm
2016-05-27T19:08:03 <avtar> the first time i tried i was directed to https://ci.gpii.net/job/windows-unit-tests/lastBuild/console.html
2016-05-27T19:08:11 <colinclark> yeah
2016-05-27T19:08:13 <avtar> but you\'re right, now i\'m getting a 404
2016-05-27T19:08:21 <colinclark> strange, eh?
2016-05-27T19:09:18 <avtar> well, we probably are just expected to expose the jenkins server to the internet as opposed to our workaround of having nginx run a static archive generated using wget :|
2016-05-27T19:10:53 <colinclark> hahaha
2016-05-27T19:10:54 <colinclark> yes
2016-05-27T19:11:04 <avtar> i was talking to gtirloni about doing the former but preferably with some modsecurity rules to help mitigate security issues
2016-05-27T19:11:12 <colinclark> oh interesting
2016-05-27T19:11:21 <colinclark> what was your opinion on that, gtirloni?
2016-05-27T19:19:25 <gtirloni> shielding jenkins behind a modsecurity instance would certainly be better
2016-05-27T19:20:33 <gtirloni> the static mirror only goes down to 3 levels, that must be why you\'re getting a 404.. going further down increases the mirroring time too much (we\'d have to run it every 10min instead)
2016-05-27T19:21:02 <colinclark> how much work to expose actual jenkins behind modsecurity?
2016-05-27T19:21:06 <gtirloni> the static mirror was always a workaround i think.. if we could have modsecurity in front of it doing both deep inspection but also only allowing the API endpoints we want, that would be better
2016-05-27T19:21:57 <gtirloni> we need to survey the jenkins API endpoints, the parameters they accept, some functional limits.. that would be the firewall layer.
2016-05-27T19:23:15 <gtirloni> this would be interesting: https://www.modsecurity.org/rules.html
2016-05-27T19:23:44 <gtirloni> malware/backdoor detection and live patching are only available with the commercial rules unfortunately.. those would be great
2016-05-27T19:24:33 <gtirloni> the idea would be to carefully open up the URLs we are going to expose, and on top of that do deep inspection.
2016-05-27T19:25:47 <gtirloni> how much work... i\'d rate it moderate to high
2016-05-27T19:27:10 <gtirloni> this would likely be enabled at the load balancing layer with nginx on a pair of frontend LBs
2016-05-27T19:27:23 <gtirloni> and could be reused for jira, wiki and the GPII containers
2016-05-27T19:28:07 <gtirloni> adewale mentioned checking apps against OWASP checklists.. this would be one way to achieve that
