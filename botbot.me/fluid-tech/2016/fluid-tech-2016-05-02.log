2016-05-02T12:30:35 <the-t-in-rtf> @Bosmon7, I am nearly ready to submit the PR for this:  https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-1773
2016-05-02T12:30:53 <the-t-in-rtf> Any "but WHY" comments about the need for this would be nice to hear.
2016-05-02T12:38:51 <the-t-in-rtf> Sorry to have to send you another gpii-express one so soon after the last.  For my sins I did go through and close out the JIRA tickets for the PRs you already merged.

2016-05-02T13:02:14 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, if you\'re looking for which of the nine ring wraiths to fight next, gpii-json-schema has a broken test that we talked about.

2016-05-02T16:30:32 <cindyli> Bosmon: the keyboard a11y demo is broken in the master. you can see the error by loading this page - http://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/keyboard-a11y/
2016-05-02T16:31:09 <cindyli> Bosmon: i traced back in the project repo and found the bug was introduced in this fix - https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/commit/83820984c86984f6fdaf6647d5511afca7005d33
2016-05-02T16:31:54 <cindyli> i haven\'t run thru all the demos and manual tests. not sure if this is the only one
2016-05-02T16:33:32 <cindyli> continuing on testing others\xe2\x80\xa6

2016-05-02T16:54:24 <cindyli> ok, i\'ve gone thru all the demos and manual tests. seems the keyboard a11y demo is the only one that\'s broken. i created a JIRA for it and assigned it to you, Bosmon - https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5895
2016-05-02T17:03:30 <Bosmon> Thanks, cindyli - fix issued here: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/707
2016-05-02T17:03:47 <cindyli> that\'s super quick, Bosmon :
2016-05-02T17:03:49 <cindyli> :)
2016-05-02T17:03:50 <Bosmon> Thanks so much for checking everything
2016-05-02T17:03:59 <cindyli> np
2016-05-02T17:04:03 <Bosmon> Well, the problem was actually that we had a helpful new diagnostic in the framework
2016-05-02T17:04:16 <Bosmon> If you look in the console, it explains exactly how the relay specification is broken : P
2016-05-02T17:04:24 <Bosmon> So the fix is simply to delete the faulty lines
