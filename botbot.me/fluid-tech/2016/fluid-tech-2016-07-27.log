2016-07-27T15:02:23 <michelled> Bosmon: I have a question I\'m hoping you can help me with. I\'ve been adding Steve\'s Task Tray code into the windows repo. I would like to start up the GPII programatically. If I run \'node gpii.js\' from the command line, it starts up fine. I assumed that putting \'require("./gpii.js");\' into my code would do the same. It certainly tries to start up, but then gives me an error.
2016-07-27T15:02:32 <michelled> any thoughts on this?
2016-07-27T15:04:43 <Bosmon> Hi there michelled
2016-07-27T15:04:49 <Bosmon> Can you explain what error you receive?
2016-07-27T15:07:26 <michelled> When it\'s registering the gpii-windows I get \'A DLL initialization routine failed\'

2016-07-27T16:02:27 <Bosmon> michelled - this probably results from the process having a different bitness to the one which you ran npm install with
2016-07-27T16:02:47 <Bosmon> You should consult sgithens about what is necessary to get it to build correctly
2016-07-27T16:03:24 <Bosmon> I seem to recall that electron\'s node/npm is a little different to the vanilla ones

2016-07-27T16:40:25 <colinclark> michelled: How come you\'re using a very old version of Electron?
2016-07-27T16:41:14 <michelled> ummm\xe2\x80\xa6 no reason. I hadn\'t looked at the version - went with what LGS was using
2016-07-27T16:41:22 <michelled> I should update that and see what happens
2016-07-27T16:41:26 <michelled> thanks for noticing colinclark
2016-07-27T16:41:50 <colinclark> The Electron API has changed, so you may find that you\'ll break things by upgrading
2016-07-27T16:42:40 <colinclark> but they\'re up to 1.3.0 now
2016-07-27T16:42:43 <colinclark> so it should be stable
2016-07-27T16:43:59 <colinclark> It\'ll be interesting, since Electron ships with a different version of Node.js than we formally support
2016-07-27T16:44:15 <colinclark> which, as Bosmon mentioned, may account for the error you\'re receiving
2016-07-27T17:00:57 <colinclark> michelled: This may be helpful: https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/v0.37.2/docs/tutorial/using-native-node-modules.md#using-native-node-modules
2016-07-27T17:01:17 <colinclark> or rather, for the latest version: https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/v1.3.1/docs/tutorial/using-native-node-modules.md
2016-07-27T17:01:38 <michelled> thx colinclark
2016-07-27T17:02:58 <colinclark> it seems likely that we\'ll have to do a bit of work to ensure that npm is building for electron, rather than vanilla Node.js
