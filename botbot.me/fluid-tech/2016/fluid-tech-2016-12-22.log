2016-12-22T21:20:25 <Sitesh> Hello everyone Sitesh here, I want some start off tips to read documentation for contributing to the project.
2016-12-22T21:21:05 <Sitesh> So what are the things that mustnt be left in the first read of documentation (the most important ones )
2016-12-22T21:22:25 <Sitesh> Anybody please ?
2016-12-22T21:30:22 * clown has left the channel
2016-12-22T21:32:07 <Sitesh> sir justin,\x0302 Bosmon, colinclark, alanharnum, michelle and cindyli \x0301. Please guide me through the starting steps well, so I can hold a good grasp of it from the beginning. Thank you
2016-12-22T21:32:33 <michelled> hi Sitesh - perhaps you can be specific about what you are trying to accomplish
2016-12-22T21:33:32 <colinclark> Sitesh: There are a number of resources you may find helpful in the wiki...
2016-12-22T21:33:33 <colinclark> https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Contributing+Code
2016-12-22T21:34:28 <colinclark> https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Get+Involved
2016-12-22T21:34:30 <Sitesh> ya michelled sir i want to contribute to this project ,so i want to know what is the best way of reading the documentation for the first time
2016-12-22T21:35:05 <colinclark> michelled: SIR! :)
2016-12-22T21:35:48 <Sitesh> ya colinclark sir, i am an undergraduate so its suits me.
2016-12-22T21:36:01 <colinclark> Sitesh: Fair enough
2016-12-22T21:36:21 <colinclark> One thing to consider, too, is that not everyone in our community will identify as a "Sir" ;)
2016-12-22T21:37:09 <Sitesh> :)
2016-12-22T21:37:14 <colinclark> Sitesh: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Coding+and+Commit+Standards
2016-12-22T21:37:28 <colinclark> And of course, the Infusion documentation itself: http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/
2016-12-22T21:37:35 <colinclark> There\'s no right way to read the documentation
2016-12-22T21:37:59 <colinclark> and as michelled, it\'s helpful to think through how you want to contribute, and to spend some time reading the documentation plus our JIRA issue tracker from that perspective
2016-12-22T21:38:12 <colinclark> Hopefully that is helpful
2016-12-22T21:38:23 <Sitesh> so i have to read the whole documentation as a first reading
2016-12-22T21:39:35 <colinclark> wow, very good
2016-12-22T21:39:51 <Sitesh> sir colinclark there are two ways of contributing ,1. Design and other 2. Tech right ?
2016-12-22T21:40:37 <Sitesh> as per my skillset (front end technologies + JS + git) i think i am well suited for "Tech" part"
2016-12-22T21:41:44 <colinclark> Cool
2016-12-22T21:41:45 <colinclark> yes, that sounds about right
2016-12-22T21:42:58 <Sitesh> so first the complete reading of infusion documentation will give me a kickstart right colinclark sir ?
2016-12-22T21:43:35 <colinclark> Hopefully it will, yes
2016-12-22T21:44:27 <Sitesh> Hopefully why ? any prior tasks to that ?
2016-12-22T21:44:51 <colinclark> Not that I can think of, no
2016-12-22T21:46:56 <Sitesh> for the first time, I should grasp everything or the important ones, colinclark ?
2016-12-22T21:48:00 * cindyli has quit
2016-12-22T21:49:15 <colinclark> I guess that\'s something you\'ll find out, Sitesh :)
2016-12-22T21:49:47 <Sitesh> thanx a lot colinclark. I will soon.
2016-12-22T21:50:03 <colinclark> good luck!
2016-12-22T22:00:41 <Sitesh> thnx a lot
