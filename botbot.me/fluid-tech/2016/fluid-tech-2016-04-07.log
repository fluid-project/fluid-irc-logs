2016-04-07T19:46:50 <cindyli> simonjb, Bosmon, colinclark, for the user management system, i started working on supporting couchDB. I was thinking about the new data structures for things we talked about yesterday such as one user could have multiple tokens. there are also other things we wanna support:
2016-04-07T19:46:57 <cindyli> 1. one user -> multiple tokens
2016-04-07T19:47:07 <cindyli> 2. one user -> multiple access tokens
2016-04-07T19:47:23 <cindyli> 3. be able to control life spans of access tokens and auth codes
2016-04-07T19:47:43 <cindyli> 4. auth codes can only used once
2016-04-07T19:49:29 <cindyli> do you think i should start modifying data structures and functions to support some or all these new features, or concentrate on moving what we have now into couchDB?
2016-04-07T19:50:40 <cindyli> if we prefer the former, we probably should come up a list of features that we\'d like to add/support at this stage
2016-04-07T20:34:08 <cindyli> simonjb, Bosmon, colinclark, hey guys, no response?
2016-04-07T20:34:16 <cindyli> i take the silence as "i can make the call"
2016-04-07T20:34:44 <cindyli> so, i will starting moving things to couchDB, then worry about the new structure we talked yesterday
