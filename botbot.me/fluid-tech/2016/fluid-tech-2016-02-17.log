2016-02-17T12:51:00 <simonjb> kasparnet: yep :)
2016-02-17T12:51:16 <kasparnet> awesome
2016-02-17T12:51:49 <simonjb> (I\'m at P4A meetings so might be slow to respond)
2016-02-17T12:51:54 <kasparnet> I sure
2016-02-17T12:52:16 <kasparnet> I\'m looking at those diagrams for the IBM arch. report
2016-02-17T12:52:23 <simonjb> ok
2016-02-17T12:52:49 <kasparnet> and I\'m not quite sure how/where the security fits in
2016-02-17T12:52:58 <kasparnet> I was wondering if I could send you a couple of diagrams
2016-02-17T12:53:01 <kasparnet> with some questions
2016-02-17T12:53:16 <kasparnet> and then we could talk about it from there
2016-02-17T12:53:26 <simonjb> sure
2016-02-17T12:55:27 * the-t-in-rtf joined the channel
2016-02-17T12:56:16 <kasparnet> simonjb: if you look here: famous pirate beard photos
2016-02-17T12:56:23 <kasparnet> well, not there
2016-02-17T12:56:41 <kasparnet> https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0ByfE6R0ipKCjQjQzMkpfd3ctTzA&usp=drive_web&ddrp=1
2016-02-17T12:56:45 <kasparnet> there ^
2016-02-17T12:56:46 <kasparnet> :)
2016-02-17T12:57:08 <kasparnet> there are three diagrams - the base diagram is the overview of the architecture flow with the hybrid setup
2016-02-17T12:57:28 <simonjb> ok
2016-02-17T12:57:51 <kasparnet> matchmaking and preferencesServer are the details of those respective parts of the base diagrams flow
2016-02-17T12:58:20 <kasparnet> as you can see, only the preferencesServer one has any security related stuff in it
2016-02-17T12:58:56 <simonjb> yeah, I see
2016-02-17T12:58:59 <kasparnet> so my questions are: Is there any security when contacting the cloud based FM? Other than HTTP (which perhaps I should explicitly point out)
2016-02-17T12:59:05 <kasparnet> (1) ^
2016-02-17T12:59:10 * avtar joined the channel
2016-02-17T12:59:51 <kasparnet> (2) Do we actually do the whole OAuth show as part of the process when fetching preferences using the hybrid flowmanager
2016-02-17T13:00:14 <kasparnet> or does this instead happen at a later point?
2016-02-17T13:00:29 <simonjb> (1) there\'s no security (oauth 2 access control style) with the hybrid FM -- but we have privacy filtering
2016-02-17T13:00:52 <kasparnet> I think that answers (2) as well then
2016-02-17T13:01:18 <kasparnet> So in that case, where are we currently getting the privacy settings from?
2016-02-17T13:01:25 <simonjb> (2) no, not for the hybrid flow manager -- the oauth 2 flow is used for integrating web clients like easit4all
2016-02-17T13:05:42 <simonjb> kasparnet: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/src/CloudBasedFlowManager.js#L239-L259
2016-02-17T13:06:05 <simonjb> this is where the privacy settings are retrieved and attached to the incoming request
2016-02-17T13:06:16 <simonjb> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/src/FlowManagerUtilities.js#L217-L249
2016-02-17T13:06:31 <simonjb> and this is where privacy filtering as applied to the request
2016-02-17T13:07:11 <simonjb> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/src/FlowManagerUtilities.js#L205-L215
2016-02-17T13:08:11 <simonjb> the privacy settings conceptually come from the authorization server
2016-02-17T13:08:48 <kasparnet> yeah - was just about to ask -- I guess the "userService" I should probably model as a (in progress) component on the diagram as well
2016-02-17T13:10:19 <simonjb> the gpii.request.flowManager.privacyFilteredMatchMakingRequest inserts the privacy filtering in to the flow manager processing flow
2016-02-17T13:10:45 <simonjb> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/src/FlowManagerUtilities.js#L170-L189

2016-02-17T13:11:58 <kasparnet> cool
2016-02-17T13:12:03 <kasparnet> thanks simonjb
2016-02-17T13:12:19 <kasparnet> I\'ll update the diagrams and perhaps ask you some more questions later :)
2016-02-17T13:12:28 <simonjb> for sure
2016-02-17T13:12:37 <simonjb> I\'ll be around
2016-02-17T13:12:50 <simonjb> thanks for doing the diagrams kasparnet
2016-02-17T13:13:24 <kasparnet> cheers - and thanks again for th help
