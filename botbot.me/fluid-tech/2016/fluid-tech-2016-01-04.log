2016-01-04T15:08:43 <cindyli1> happy new year, kasparnet. as you know, i'm working on the edit privacy settings UI for the OAuth security server - https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-1245 and my branch will be used for the review4. i wonder if your review4 branch is going to use bosmon's pull request that upgrades the universal to use the latest infusion, kettle, express and node - https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/425. it will determine if I should upgrade my cur
2016-01-04T15:09:10 <kasparnet> hi cindyli1! Happy new year to you as well

2016-01-04T15:09:29 <kasparnet> our review4 branch wont be updated to use Bosmons updates
2016-01-04T15:09:53 <kasparnet> it's quite different from the master branch and it would be a lot of work to get bosmons work merged in
2016-01-04T15:10:33 <cindyli1> good to know. thanks, kasparnet. i will still upgrade my branch to work with bosmon's pull request but push it up to a separate branch for a after-review merge
2016-01-04T15:11:38 <cindyli1> my current GPII-1245 branch will stay on its current state working with the infusion from the master
