2016-01-07T20:20:28 <cindyli> hi Bosmon
2016-01-07T20:22:42 <cindyli> with infusion 2.x, can i use "{/ [componentName]}" to retrieve components that are not on the current component tree?
2016-01-07T20:22:49 <cindyli> my use case,
2016-01-07T20:23:20 <cindyli> i have these lines to create tooltips for some buttons:
2016-01-07T20:23:22 <cindyli> fluid.each(editButtons, function (thisEditButton) {
2016-01-07T20:23:22 <cindyli> fluid.tooltip(thisEditButton, tooltipOptionsForEdit);
2016-01-07T20:23:22 <cindyli> });
2016-01-07T20:24:23 <cindyli> in the test, i\'d like to validate tooltips are instantiated. to retrieve tooltips:
2016-01-07T20:24:36 <cindyli> listener: "gpii.tests.oauth2.privacySettings.assertRendering",
2016-01-07T20:24:36 <cindyli> args: ["{privacySettings}", "{/ fluid.tooltip}"],
2016-01-07T20:24:36 <cindyli> priority: "last",
2016-01-07T20:24:36 <cindyli> event: "{privacySettings}.events.afterRender"
2016-01-07T20:25:05 <cindyli> note the 2nd argument uses "{/ fluid.tooltip}"
2016-01-07T20:26:00 <cindyli> however, received undefined in the listener
2016-01-07T20:26:36 <cindyli> am i using global component tree correctly, Bosmon?
2016-01-07T20:27:10 <cindyli> the examples i found so far only use "{/ \xe2\x80\xa6}" in distributeOptions targets
