2016-04-05T20:34:34 <alanharnum> simonjb: yeah, i ordered a copy this weekend - should have it soon
2016-04-05T20:34:55 <simonjb> I\'d be interested in how you find it
2016-04-05T20:35:06 <simonjb> neat idea
2016-04-05T20:35:50 <simonjb> alanharnum: this is aimed a little differently but also very interesting: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/primotoys/cubetto-hands-on-coding-for-girls-and-boys-aged-3?token=e3978e14
2016-04-05T20:35:57 <simonjb> have you seen it?
2016-04-05T20:36:04 <alanharnum> i haven\'t, but am looking at http://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/68015/games-programming-mechanism right now
2016-04-05T20:36:19 <alanharnum> i think it\'s become a big thing in the last few years due to the "teach all kids to code" movement
2016-04-05T20:36:27 <simonjb> yeah
2016-04-05T20:36:39 <alanharnum> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RoboRally is one of the most venerable
2016-04-05T20:38:07 <simonjb> cool, thanks for the link to RoboRally -- I hadn\'t seen that one before
2016-04-05T20:38:16 <alanharnum> it\'s a lot of fun, but looooong
2016-04-05T20:38:30 <simonjb> you have it?
