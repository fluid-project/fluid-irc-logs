2016-01-29T20:41:59 <cindyli> hi Bosmon
2016-01-29T20:43:37 <cindyli> there\'s an interesting thing with "distributeOptions" target: https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/GPII-1521/gpii/node_modules/preferencesServer/src/preferencesServer.js#L105
2016-01-29T20:44:35 <cindyli> this commented line is the initial target form I used for running cloudBased.development config - https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/GPII-1521/gpii/configs/cloudBased.development.all.local.json#L5-L18
2016-01-29T20:45:07 <cindyli> where an in memory data store is constructed and distributed down to the preferences server
2016-01-29T20:45:57 <Bosmon> Hi cindyli
2016-01-29T20:46:09 <cindyli> this data store will continue to be passed down by the distributeOptions block at line 105
2016-01-29T20:46:17 <cindyli> things work fine.
2016-01-29T20:46:33 <cindyli> however, if i ran preference server by itself, without the flow manager
2016-01-29T20:47:04 <cindyli> in that case, the distributeOptions block at line 105 should pass down the data store that\'s created at line 96
2016-01-29T20:47:34 <cindyli> this distribution doesn\'t work, meaning the target didn\'t receive the in memory data store
2016-01-29T20:47:38 * Justin_o has quit
2016-01-29T20:47:42 <Bosmon> cindyli - yes, that\'s right
2016-01-29T20:47:44 <cindyli> so, i changed the line 105 to 106
2016-01-29T20:47:46 <cindyli> why?
2016-01-29T20:47:49 <Bosmon> You can\'t advise components "that are not there"
2016-01-29T20:47:56 <cindyli> ah
2016-01-29T20:47:59 <Bosmon> A component which is injected wholesale has already been constructed elsewhere
2016-01-29T20:48:10 <Bosmon> So it will ignore any distributions that are targetted at its injected location
2016-01-29T20:48:18 <cindyli> you mean "authorizationService" hasn\'t been constructed at the time?
2016-01-29T20:48:33 <Bosmon> cindyli - I\'m referring to the top-level configs
2016-01-29T20:48:47 <Bosmon> https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/GPII-1521/gpii/configs/cloudBased.development.all.local.json#L15
2016-01-29T20:48:51 <Bosmon> So for this distribution
2016-01-29T20:48:57 <Bosmon> You are distributing a fully-constructed component
2016-01-29T20:49:06 <Bosmon> So you can\'t expect to reconfigure it after it has been injected
2016-01-29T20:49:25 <Bosmon> I *think* this is your question?
2016-01-29T20:49:50 <Bosmon> Ah wait, I see.... you\'re still injecting the whole component
2016-01-29T20:50:01 <cindyli> when i ran preference server standalone, i expected the data store would be fully constructed here: https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/GPII-1521/gpii/node_modules/preferencesServer/src/preferencesServer.js#L96-L98
2016-01-29T20:50:09 <cindyli> yes
2016-01-29T20:50:58 <Bosmon> Your distribution on line 105 is a bit crackers anyway
2016-01-29T20:51:01 <cindyli> once i change the target from line 105 to 106, everything works
2016-01-29T20:51:15 <Bosmon> The whole point of distributions is to get to the component in one step
2016-01-29T20:51:16 <cindyli> why cracky
2016-01-29T20:51:54 <Bosmon> Even the line 106 one is a little bit crackers
2016-01-29T20:52:03 <cindyli> line 105 is to make it clear about the path to the target
2016-01-29T20:52:18 <cindyli> so ppl don\'t need to figure out this is all for authGrantFinder
2016-01-29T20:52:22 <Bosmon> http://lamecca786.com/wp-content/gallery/dry-goods-crackerscookies/Crackers-Cookies.jpg
2016-01-29T20:52:39 <cindyli> the cookie looks awesome :)
2016-01-29T20:53:24 <cindyli> what\'s wrong with 106?
2016-01-29T20:53:34 <cindyli> and my question is, why 106 works but not 105?
2016-01-29T20:53:52 <cindyli> also, why 105 works with cloudBased but not preferences server standalone?
2016-01-29T20:54:45 <Bosmon> cindyli - also, we currently have https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5614
2016-01-29T20:55:02 <Bosmon> In general it is inadvisable to broadcast "deep trees" of options since they are quite likely to be lost during merging
2016-01-29T20:55:20 <Bosmon> You should always right the "context part" of distributions so that they get directly to the component you want
2016-01-29T20:56:26 <cindyli> ok. good to know
2016-01-29T20:57:28 <cindyli> simonjb: in case you are interested, Bosmon\'s three lines above answer our question about the distributeOptions target
2016-01-29T20:58:17 <simonjb> thanks cindyli
2016-01-29T20:58:30 <cindyli> np. thanks to Bosmon ;)
2016-01-29T20:59:45 <Bosmon> The 106 distribution more clearly expresses what you mean, anyway
2016-01-29T20:59:58 <Bosmon> "Make sure that the authorizationService\'s dataStore, wherever it is, is the same as mine"
2016-01-29T21:03:11 <Bosmon> I\'ll be resolving FLUID-5614 in the next big framework rewrite, but it\'s best in general not to produce options definitions deeper than you need
2016-01-29T21:03:36 <cindyli> got it. thanks
2016-01-29T21:04:22 <Bosmon> cindyli - could I get you to make a branch holding the line 105 version of the preferences server and add a reference to it to the FLUID-5614 JIRA?
2016-01-29T21:04:31 <Bosmon> Also with instructions on how to see the failure
2016-01-29T21:04:44 <cindyli> sure, Bosmon
2016-01-29T21:04:48 <Bosmon> It will be useful to make sure this gets resolved at that time

2016-01-29T14:20:32 <cindyli> good morning, Bosmon
2016-01-29T14:20:56 <Bosmon> Good morning CINDY QI LI!
2016-01-29T14:21:37 <cindyli> yesterday simonjb and i were talking about how to share one single in memory data store instance in the flow manager for the security server, and the preference server for the authFinder
2016-01-29T14:22:06 <cindyli> we were thinking to instantiate a data store component at the top level and distribute it to those 2 parts, like this: https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/GPII-1521/gpii/configs/cloudBased.development.all.local.json#L5-L15
2016-01-29T14:22:45 <Bosmon> Yes
2016-01-29T14:22:45 <cindyli> however, i found distributing (or overwriting) one actual subcomponent threw error
2016-01-29T14:22:50 <Bosmon> I think you have it slightly wrong
2016-01-29T14:22:55 <cindyli> oh
2016-01-29T14:23:03 * anastasiac joined the channel
2016-01-29T14:23:04 <cindyli> where is the problem?
2016-01-29T14:23:10 <Bosmon> Well, maybe two problems
2016-01-29T14:23:28 <Bosmon> For a start, you are attempting to broadcast "to the component" rather than to the options which designate the component
2016-01-29T14:23:43 <Bosmon> So to replace the component\'s designation you would need to broadcast to options.components.oauth2DataStore
2016-01-29T14:23:56 <Bosmon> Secondly I think you are broadcasting the wrong material
2016-01-29T14:23:59 <cindyli> ah ha
2016-01-29T14:24:21 <Bosmon> "record" represents literal material
2016-01-29T14:24:36 <Bosmon> And so you would need to broadcast a reference which resolves from the point of view of the target
2016-01-29T14:24:53 <Bosmon> E.g. something like {cloudBased.development.all.local}.oauth2DataStore
2016-01-29T14:25:20 <cindyli> right. exactly.
2016-01-29T14:25:39 <cindyli> how can that slip out of my mind. very helpful. thanks, Bosmon
2016-01-29T14:25:42 <Bosmon> It is the other variant, "source" which resolve from the point of view of the source
2016-01-29T14:25:51 <Bosmon> Although it seems we rarely use "source" these days
2016-01-29T14:26:10 <Bosmon> I think, based on our increasing ability with options distributions to "get it right first time"
2016-01-29T14:26:26 <Bosmon> I think that "source" is a basically "facade-forming pattern" - that is, some options have been sent to you, and you want to send them on
2016-01-29T14:26:44 <Bosmon> But with the increased power of distributeOptions, it\'s now usually possible for the ultimate source to address the ultimate target in a single step
2016-01-29T14:27:27 <cindyli> i see.
