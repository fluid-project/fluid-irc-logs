2016-11-21T15:22:53 <gtirloni> cindyli: hi! about that issue you are having at home with npm... any change in the situation?
2016-11-21T15:23:15 <cindyli> no, gtirloni, still having problems :(
2016-11-21T15:23:24 <gtirloni> cindyli: are you working from home today?
2016-11-21T15:23:28 <cindyli> i'm in office today
2016-11-21T15:24:04 <gtirloni> ok, maybe we can do a screen share later this week to try to find what's wrong.. i couldn't reproduce on linux/win10
2016-11-21T15:24:33 <gtirloni> fluid-everyone: anyone on OSX could help run `vagrant up` on GPII/windows' master branch? preferably with virtualbox 5.1.9 and vagrant 1.8.7...
2016-11-21T15:25:04 <cindyli> thanks, gtirloni
2016-11-21T15:25:57 <gtirloni> cindyli: something else you may want to try... instead of wireless, try to connect a cable directly to your router to rule out any connectivity issues
2016-11-21T15:26:34 <cindyli> will try that, gtirloni
2016-11-21T15:40:31 <Justin_o> gtirloni: i'm having trouble opening the edit mode in the wiki
2016-11-21T15:40:42 <Justin_o> it just spins a progress indicator
2016-11-21T15:41:08 <Justin_o> also a dialog pops up that says if it doesn't start to work shortly i should contact my confluence admin
2016-11-21T15:41:10 <gtirloni> Justin_o: ok, i'll check
2016-11-21T15:41:24 <Justin_o> gtirloni: thanks
