2016-03-03T20:49:08 <cindyli> avtar: i use "vagrant up" then "grunt tests" to run infusion tests and hit this error:
2016-03-03T20:49:09 <cindyli> grunt tests
2016-03-03T20:49:09 <cindyli> Running "shell:runTests" (shell) task
2016-03-03T20:49:09 <cindyli> bash: testem: command not found
2016-03-03T20:49:09 <cindyli> Warning: Command failed: /bin/sh -c vagrant ssh -c \'cd /home/vagrant/sync/; DISPLAY=:0 testem ci --file tests/testem.json\'
2016-03-03T20:49:09 <cindyli> Use --force to continue.
2016-03-03T20:49:26 <cindyli> i thought "testem" should not be required with this approach
2016-03-03T20:50:38 <cindyli> i mean the vm should carry testem
2016-03-03T20:56:04 <avtar> cindyli: the vm should have it installed
2016-03-03T20:56:40 <avtar> could you please share the output of \'vagrant up\'?
2016-03-03T20:58:29 <cindyli> avtar: the output of "vagrant up" - http://pastebin.com/8Ux2Sc80
2016-03-03T21:26:28 <cindyli> avtar: sorry for bugging u with more stuff. i\'m downloading and installing the fedora vm to set up GPII. i cloned GPII/linux repo and ran "vagrant up". the vm was downloaded and then hangs about 5 mins at this step:
2016-03-03T21:26:34 <cindyli> ==> default: TASK: [nodejs | Install Node.js on Fedora] ************************************
2016-03-03T21:26:38 <cindyli> is that normal?
2016-03-03T21:26:56 * gtirloni has left the channel
2016-03-03T21:27:36 <cindyli> i wonder if i should terminate the command and run it again
2016-03-03T21:28:33 <avtar> cindyli: the only places where the process seems like it stalls every now and then is when installing packages from external repositories like the yum one where it\'s currently trying to fetch packages from or more likely when npm is installing stuff
2016-03-03T21:28:43 <avtar> 5 mins to fetch that nodejs package seems like a lot though
2016-03-03T21:29:04 <avtar> i would start the process again
2016-03-03T21:29:18 <cindyli> cool. will try. thanks, avtar
