2016-12-14T12:53:36 <amatas> gtirloni, I don\'t know if you realized of this but the GPII windows tests failed because the new Vagrant version doesn\'t support winrm commands
2016-12-14T12:54:08 <amatas> I\'m trying to workaround this using "vagrant ssh -- [command]"
2016-12-14T12:55:55 <Bosmon> Hi there simonjb
2016-12-14T12:55:59 <Bosmon> You\'re up early :)
2016-12-14T12:56:19 <gtirloni> amatas: i think we\'ve been using that box since mid-October. it seems to have worked before... maybe we really need the vagrant winrm plugin?
2016-12-14T12:56:28 <simonjb> Bosmon: I\'m in N. Ireland visiting my family :)
2016-12-14T12:56:59 <simonjb> Bosmon: I\'d love to chat with you about Nexus if you had some time
2016-12-14T12:57:31 <Bosmon> oh hey
2016-12-14T12:57:39 <Bosmon> Welcome to CIVVILLIZZATION : P
2016-12-14T12:57:42 <simonjb> :)
2016-12-14T12:57:49 <Bosmon> I need to grab some lunch, but we can chat in a bit
2016-12-14T12:57:53 <Bosmon> WIll you be around in the afternoon?
2016-12-14T12:58:07 <simonjb> yes, definitely
2016-12-14T12:58:56 <amatas> gtirloni, it seems that the winrm plugin doesn\'t work with the latest version of Vagrant, at least it\'s what I saw in my local tests
2016-12-14T12:59:16 <simonjb> Bosmon: I started just yesterday on the dynamic component injection and wanted to get your thoughts
2016-12-14T12:59:37 <simonjb> https://github.com/simonbates/nexus-experiments/blob/master/dynamicInjection.js
2016-12-14T13:06:54 <Bosmon> simonjb - ah, brilliant
2016-12-14T13:06:57 <Bosmon> Looks very good to me
2016-12-14T13:07:15 <Bosmon> Do you find that it works? : P
2016-12-14T13:08:32 <simonjb> yes, it works just fine
2016-12-14T13:08:39 * the-t-in-rtf has quit
2016-12-14T13:08:54 <Bosmon> simonjb - really good
2016-12-14T13:09:31 <simonjb> I was thinking about the structure of the components made in my gpii.nexus.experiments.constructRecipe() function
2016-12-14T13:09:42 <simonjb> and if you might have other ideas
2016-12-14T13:10:34 <simonjb> currently, it creates a container, adds the peers as subcomponents and then the recipe as a subcomponent called "recipe"
2016-12-14T13:10:57 <Bosmon> I guess that in the end, recipes should themselves be grades
2016-12-14T13:11:19 <Bosmon> And make more "symbolic" references to the components they bind to
2016-12-14T13:11:39 <simonjb> that\'s where I\'d love to get your help
2016-12-14T13:12:04 <Bosmon> Right now there\'s no distinction between the definition of a recipe and its embodiment
2016-12-14T13:12:11 <simonjb> right
2016-12-14T13:12:11 <Bosmon> Its EXTENSA and its POTENTIA, if you will : P
2016-12-14T13:15:11 <Bosmon> Oh, I see
2016-12-14T13:15:16 <Bosmon> I\'m starting to follow a bit better now...
2016-12-14T13:15:37 <Bosmon> The recipe IS a grade
2016-12-14T13:15:53 <Bosmon> It\'s just its referents are listed elsewhere
2016-12-14T13:15:57 <Bosmon> I think we can just fold all that together
2016-12-14T13:16:11 <simonjb> yeshttps://github.com/simonbates/nexus-experiments/blob/master/dynamicInjection.js#L30
2016-12-14T13:16:20 <simonjb> yes, https://github.com/simonbates/nexus-experiments/blob/master/dynamicInjection.js#L30
2016-12-14T13:17:08 <simonjb> Bosmon: we can chat in a bit after lunch (I need to grab some also)
2016-12-14T13:17:12 <Bosmon> Sure
2016-12-14T13:17:16 <Bosmon> Catch you in a bit!
2016-12-14T13:17:20 <simonjb> thanks!
2016-12-14T13:17:44 <gtirloni> amatas: i installed the \'vagrant-winrm\' plugin again and it seems to have worked - https://ci.gpii.net/job/windows-tests/105/

2016-12-14T14:05:48 <gtirloni> amatas: while checking jenkins\' logs, i noticed a bunch of error from a jnpl client that was trying to connect from h-0005.. i found a systemd service called \'jenkins-node\', can i disable that? it\'s running as the \'jenkins-gpii\' service. just checking if this is not from the jenkins-node role or something...
2016-12-14T14:06:11 <gtirloni> the service was created on july, i may even have created it.. i don\'t really remember
