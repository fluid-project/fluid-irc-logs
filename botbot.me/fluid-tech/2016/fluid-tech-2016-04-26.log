2016-04-26T11:15:41 <the-t-in-rtf> @bosmon, I spent some time writing a function to clearly display a `gpii.express` instance's routing table.  You can see sample output here:
2016-04-26T11:15:42 <the-t-in-rtf> http://pastie.org/10813438
2016-04-26T11:16:12 <the-t-in-rtf> I can already see a few problems with the gpii-json-schema content I wanted to talk about, will work through it for a while.

2016-04-26T11:16:54 <the-t-in-rtf> That's the function that produces the output in the pastie.

2016-04-26T11:23:38 <the-t-in-rtf> I am moving it to its own file now to avoid the problem we talked about yesterday whenever jqUnit is required, i.e. we sometimes want to be able to inspect running instances outside of tests.
