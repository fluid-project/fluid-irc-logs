b"2016-11-16T18:29:30 <avtar> gtirloni: an alternate approach could be to continue using if a stub file like the one in amatas' repo https://github.com/amatas/vagrant-vmenv/blob/master/Vagrantfile.template but to pair it with a vagrant plugin

2016-11-16T18:30:03 <avtar> that would address the node path issues that the-t-in-rtf1 and i ran into
2016-11-16T18:30:24 * michelled has quit
2016-11-16T18:30:55 <avtar> and still collect vagrantfile development in a single location that people would have access to by installing this plugin
2016-11-16T18:31:04 <gtirloni> tbh it feels weird having a dependency on node for this
2016-11-16T18:31:28 <avtar> i agree
2016-11-16T18:31:57 * michelled joined the channel
2016-11-16T18:33:18 <amatas> gtirloni, that makes sense, and yes I think that Avtar and I are in sync about the next steps
2016-11-16T18:33:31 <gtirloni> ok awesome
2016-11-16T18:34:01 <amatas> and also, if we finally implement the Vagrant plugin we can get rid of the Vagrantfile, because vagrant could create it from the definition file.
2016-11-16T18:36:02 <amatas> sorry guys I have to leave
2016-11-16T18:36:07 <amatas> see you later
2016-11-16T18:37:31 <avtar> amatas: i didn't understand that last part about a vagrantfile getting generated
2016-11-16T18:38:13 <avtar> when you have a chance could you please update the relevant jira with details about your approach?

2016-11-16T23:05:28 <avtar> are you around tomorrow?
2016-11-16T23:05:57 <gtirloni> yep
2016-11-16T23:09:12 <avtar> could you please do me a favour?
2016-11-16T23:09:20 <gtirloni> always
2016-11-16T23:09:29 <avtar> i ran out of time today but i was supposed to build a vagrant box for cindy
2016-11-16T23:10:04 <avtar> she's been having issues getting gpii-windows built in a win10 vm using vagrant 1.7.5 and vbox 5.0.28
2016-11-16T23:11:01 <gtirloni> ok. just try to spin it up here with those versions?
2016-11-16T23:11:42 <gtirloni> i can check with her tomorrow, no worries
2016-11-16T23:15:52 <avtar> sorry, stepped away for a sec
2016-11-16T23:16:03 <avtar> yeah i was going to build a box for her just so that she could continue with her work
2016-11-16T23:17:26 <gtirloni> ok. consider it done
2016-11-16T23:17:31 <avtar> thank youuuuu
2016-11-16T23:17:36 <gtirloni> just do it. tomorrow.

2016-11-16T17:54:56 <colinclark> Hi gtirloni, amatas, and avtar!
2016-11-16T17:55:11 <avtar> hi
2016-11-16T17:55:12 <colinclark> I wanted to pick up the issue we didn\'t get to in today\'s GPII architecture meeting
2016-11-16T17:55:24 * gtirloni has quit
2016-11-16T17:55:32 <colinclark> there goes gtirloni :)
2016-11-16T17:55:44 <avtar> probably getting skype ready
2016-11-16T17:55:51 <amatas> hi colinclark !
2016-11-16T17:56:13 <colinclark> I\'ll type here for a bit, and gtirloni can catch up on the logs
2016-11-16T17:56:38 <colinclark> First, I want to set out a clear set of expectations about how we do APCP infrastructure work, since I think we\'ve had some crossed wires
2016-11-16T17:56:46 <colinclark> and undoubtedly, I\'m also a source of this
2016-11-16T17:56:57 <colinclark> First up, I\'ll point out that fluid-ops is an unlogged channel
2016-11-16T17:57:30 <colinclark> it\'s not logged for a reason\xe2\x80\x94so we can talk about sensitive operations-related issues that we wouldn\'t want the world to see. You know, like details about patching versions of software or whatever
2016-11-16T17:57:52 <colinclark> So when it comes to doing development work related to infrastructure, we should be discussing it in a logged channel
2016-11-16T17:57:55 * gtirloni joined the channel
2016-11-16T17:57:57 <colinclark> so here is a nice spot to have those conversations
2016-11-16T17:58:28 <colinclark> The advantage is precisely what I said above\xe2\x80\x94we can all go back and check the logs if we\'re offline or busy or whatever
2016-11-16T17:58:30 <amatas> ok, agree with that
2016-11-16T17:58:41 <colinclark> Secondly, we need to do a better job of staying in touch on a regular basis in three key places:
2016-11-16T17:58:46 <colinclark> 1. Here in the IRC channel
2016-11-16T17:58:54 <colinclark> 2. On JIRAs that specifically track our work
2016-11-16T17:58:59 <colinclark> 3. On the architecture mailing list
2016-11-16T17:59:15 <colinclark> every task we work on related to infrastructure should be discussed in all three places, regularly
2016-11-16T17:59:37 <colinclark> The fourth forum, of course, is our weekly ops meetings, which we will get better at having consistently
2016-11-16T17:59:57 <colinclark> I\'m sorry we\'ve had troubles with scheduling and that I\'ve missed a few of them recently
2016-11-16T18:00:45 <colinclark> Are you all cool with a tighter loop of conversations and planning discussions for our infrastructure, here and in forums #2 and #3 (above), amatas, gtirloni, avtar?
2016-11-16T18:01:00 <gtirloni> sounds good
2016-11-16T18:01:08 <amatas> sounds good for me as well
2016-11-16T18:01:47 <colinclark> Ok, cool!
2016-11-16T18:02:02 <colinclark> So I know gtirloni\'s got an imminent interview, so I don\'t want to distract too much
2016-11-16T18:02:15 <colinclark> but I wonder if we can find some time to discuss whether there\'s overlap between the work you two are doing, amatas and gtirloni
2016-11-16T18:02:34 <colinclark> I heard at the archi meeting today that you were looking at a vagrant plugin for our CI work, amatas. And I think you\'re also working on that, gtirloni?
2016-11-16T18:02:59 <colinclark> Is there overlap?
2016-11-16T18:03:04 <colinclark> Are we collaborating on this?
2016-11-16T18:03:14 <amatas> I don\'t think that is an overlap
2016-11-16T18:03:25 <colinclark> ok, great
2016-11-16T18:03:37 <colinclark> can you elaborate here, amatas, on what you\'re working on and how it relates to gtirloni\'s work?
2016-11-16T18:03:45 <amatas> sure
2016-11-16T18:04:29 <amatas> I\'m working on the vagrant-vmenv https://github.com/amatas/vagrant-vmenv that was introduced some time ago in the architecture list
2016-11-16T18:05:16 <amatas> but I understand that the transition to that approach can be slow, as the people go put that changes in the repositories
2016-11-16T18:05:53 <amatas> also the vagrant-vmenv is in a early stage so some people, like Avtar, Gio, Tony are testing in order to improve the module/plugin
2016-11-16T18:06:38 <amatas> the work that Gio is doing is related to the actual stable approach that we are using in all our repositories
2016-11-16T18:07:28 <gtirloni> amatas, if you\'re turning vagrant-vmenv from a node module into a vagrant plugin, then that\'s it
2016-11-16T18:07:51 <amatas> agree gtirloni , I\'m on that
2016-11-16T18:07:58 <colinclark> So I\'m not fully understanding
2016-11-16T18:08:13 <colinclark> How is your work different, amatas?
2016-11-16T18:08:41 <colinclark> it sounds like you\'re maybe saying that your version is an early prototype, and gtirloni is working on the production version? But the functionality is the same?
2016-11-16T18:09:01 <colinclark> Is this something you presented at this week\'s ops meeting, which I (sadly) missed?
2016-11-16T18:11:31 <amatas> sorry colinclark , I think that Avtar explains better than me in this mail http://lists.gpii.net/pipermail/architecture/2016-September/004315.html
2016-11-16T18:12:47 <amatas> the new approach tries to improves the CI providing methods to spin up several VMs if necessary, simplify the definition of the tests (using the .qi.yml) and get rid of files and directories in the project repositories (like provisioning directory and Vagranfile)
2016-11-16T18:13:35 <colinclark> but isn\'t that also what Gio is working on, amatas?
2016-11-16T18:13:45 <gtirloni> amatas, regarding a new yaml format (maybe using gitlab\'s yml as a starting point), is that something you plan to modify vagrant-vmenv to work with?
2016-11-16T18:13:57 <colinclark> I\'m sorry if this is something you guys discussed in depth at the ops meeting on Monday, I\'m just trying to understand better
2016-11-16T18:14:04 <avtar> amatas, colinclark, gtirloni: sorry, i was getting set up for an interview call.. catching up on the channel logs now
2016-11-16T18:14:10 <amatas> colinclark, more info in this Jira issue: https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2066
2016-11-16T18:14:50 * kasparnet has quit
2016-11-16T18:17:00 <amatas> colinclark, no worries. I don\'t mind to explain something again if it\'s necessary. My frustration is to not articulate the ideas better to make the people understand :D
2016-11-16T18:17:10 <colinclark> :)
2016-11-16T18:17:52 <amatas> is all the vagrant stuff more clear now?
2016-11-16T18:18:06 <gtirloni> not really
2016-11-16T18:18:11 <amatas> do any you have any concerns?
2016-11-16T18:18:15 <gtirloni> please see my question above
2016-11-16T18:18:37 <amatas> oh, sorry gtirloni I missed that line
2016-11-16T18:18:40 <colinclark> Me, I\'m just super confused :)
2016-11-16T18:19:42 <amatas> gtirloni, yes, I\'m planing to integrate with gitlab\'s yaml file, if finally we use that application to run our tests in the QI
2016-11-16T18:20:52 <gtirloni> ok, that covers 100% of what i planned to do (turning vmenv into a plugin, and making it work with the new yaml format). since you have worked on vmenv since before the toronto f2f (where we came to know about it), I\'d like to take a step back and help in some other way (maybe reviewing the code and beta testing it). that should clear the confusion and set the ownership clear
2016-11-16T18:21:00 <amatas> I\'m focused on to have only one definition test file in our repository and either the vagrant-vmenv plugin at the developer machine or the CI at our servers can understand and is able to spin up the testing environment and run all the tests
2016-11-16T18:23:11 <gtirloni> awesome, that\'s what we need
2016-11-16T18:23:17 <colinclark> I think I\'d like to make sure this isn\'t an issue of "ownership," gtirloni, but rather one of making sure we\'ve got everyone on the same page in terms of a) what our goals are for this work and b) who\'s doing what

2016-11-16T18:25:49 <gtirloni> we need a vagrant plugin that reads a single YAML file (preferably in gitlab format, which avtar & alfredo are in sync about I think) and does not require any Vagrantfile (any!).. just that yaml file. This should support our test cases (single app) and the recently requests multi-VM support for e2e testing (that Alfredo already got working with the current YAML format).. this vagrant plugin should probably have a command line option (I was
2016-11-16T18:25:50 <gtirloni> aiming for `vagrant qi <subcommand>`) where people can tell it to update the local Vagrantfile that were created previously (or maybe it should this always.. with some caching)
2016-11-16T18:26:46 <gtirloni> the plugin should enforce some other things that would be useful in a CI environment (e.g. ensure the VM is already destroyed, maybe as an option too)
2016-11-16T18:26:59 <gtirloni> does that make sense?
