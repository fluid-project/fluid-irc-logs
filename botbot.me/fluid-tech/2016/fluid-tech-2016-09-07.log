2016-09-07T13:40:34 <alanharnum> Bosmon Justin_o: while I\'m sure we\'re all a bit tired of TTS at this exact moment, I\'m making a small PR for this issue: https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5951
2016-09-07T13:40:46 <alanharnum> this will mean the TTS tests run & pass in the latest MS Edge, which is cool
2016-09-07T13:41:30 <michelled> that is cool.
2016-09-07T13:42:03 <michelled> Justin_o, colinclark: is edge one of our supported browsers right now?
2016-09-07T13:43:21 <alanharnum> IMO if it isn\'t it should be
2016-09-07T13:43:34 <michelled> I agree
2016-09-07T13:44:18 <michelled> Justin_o: was suggesting that we get rid of the old browser support page on the wiki and put our browser support into the readme. I think it\'s a good idea.
2016-09-07T13:44:49 <michelled> that page doesn\'t even look trustworthy with the note at the top saying that it\'s moving https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/docs/Browser+Support
2016-09-07T13:45:41 <alanharnum> We should be testing separately in the latest & last IE, and in Edge
2016-09-07T13:45:55 <alanharnum> which is a PITA but a necessity given how many people are still on pre-10 Windows
2016-09-07T13:47:08 * alanharn_ joined the channel
2016-09-07T13:50:42 <Justin_o> alanharnum, michelled: we\'ve held off of edge because of it\'s lack of a11y support, but it seems to have improved recently. colinclark sent me a page about it recently but i seemed to have lost it
2016-09-07T13:57:12 <colinclark> Justin_o: http://html5accessibility.com/
2016-09-07T13:57:21 <Justin_o> colinclark: thanks :)
2016-09-07T13:59:23 <colinclark> I\'ve been a longtime proponent of only supporting the latest version of each vendor\'s browser\xe2\x80\x94in other words, only Edge
2016-09-07T13:59:40 <colinclark> but unfortunately it\'s probably still a bit early for that
2016-09-07T14:00:39 <colinclark> but we might not be too far off
2016-09-07T14:03:57 <Justin_o> i should look up the metrics again, i think Win 7 was still in high use
2016-09-07T14:04:18 <Justin_o> here\'s one https://www.netmarketshare.com/operating-system-market-share.aspx?qprid=10&qpcustomd=0
2016-09-07T14:09:09 * alanharnum joined the channel
2016-09-07T14:09:30 <alanharnum> colinclark: i\'d support that if Edge was usable in pre-10 Windows
2016-09-07T14:09:33 <alanharnum> unfortunately it isn\'t
2016-09-07T14:10:10 <alanharnum> i think you effectively need to treat IE & Edge as separate browsers
2016-09-07T14:10:26 <colinclark> You do
2016-09-07T14:10:39 <colinclark> but I guess my point isn\'t to universally support all browsers
2016-09-07T14:10:50 <colinclark> I\'m not yet seriously proposing this
2016-09-07T14:10:52 * kasparnet has quit
2016-09-07T14:12:09 <alanharnum> i can see the case for dropping IE10 support eventually, yeah
2016-09-07T14:12:24 <colinclark> but my experience is that a very wide-ranging A grade browser support policy is very expensive
2016-09-07T14:12:37 <alanharnum> although I feel for those on restrictive IT setups where they have pre-10 Windows and MS-only browser options
2016-09-07T14:12:48 <colinclark> right
2016-09-07T14:13:33 <colinclark> I remember Clayton telling me that, even back in 2014, he was stuck on IE6 when he worked for the US federal government
2016-09-07T14:13:54 <colinclark> but Infusion is also about pushing the boundaries of the web and inclusive design
2016-09-07T14:14:20 <colinclark> hence the possibility that we\'d want to be a little bit more restrictive about our browser support
2016-09-07T14:14:39 <colinclark> If supporting IE11 were massively costly right now, I\'d be making this argument for reals
2016-09-07T14:14:45 <alanharnum> yup
2016-09-07T14:14:49 <colinclark> but so far it seems like it hasn\'t been awful, with the exception of a few issues
2016-09-07T14:15:08 <colinclark> and given that we haven\'t even figured out how to automatically launch Edge with Testem... :)
2016-09-07T14:15:26 <alanharnum> https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/WindowsForBusiness/End-of-IE-support claims IE11 will be supported for the life of Windows 7/8/10.
2016-09-07T14:15:31 * kasparnet joined the channel
2016-09-07T14:15:41 <alanharnum> I\'d say once Windows 8 drops out of official MS support we\'d be in a position to go Edge-only
2016-09-07T14:15:44 <alanharnum> maybe
2016-09-07T14:16:00 <colinclark> I suspect Windows 8 really isn\'t our milestone
2016-09-07T14:16:10 <colinclark> I haven\'t seen numbers, but fewer people upgraded to it
2016-09-07T14:16:20 <colinclark> and presumably a larger percentage of those who did also upgraded to 10
2016-09-07T14:16:38 <alanharnum> yeah, from Justin_o\'s link it looks like 7 + XP are still at nearly 60% market share
2016-09-07T14:17:19 <colinclark> I suppose what I"m advocating for is explicitly a non-marketshare based policy for browser support
2016-09-07T14:17:23 <colinclark> wild as that sounds
2016-09-07T14:17:41 <colinclark> but a cost-based one
2016-09-07T14:18:11 <colinclark> When IE11 starts costing us much more to support, we drop it
2016-09-07T14:18:20 <alanharnum> reasonable
2016-09-07T14:18:36 <alanharnum> it also depends a little on what we mean by "support"
2016-09-07T14:20:11 <alanharnum> TTS is a good example of that - it doesn\'t work in IE11 & never will, but we\'ve got means to bypass that in our testing etc
2016-09-07T14:20:52 <alanharnum> there\'s probably a different support threshold for "framework" vs. "component", if that makes sense
2016-09-07T14:21:58 <colinclark> yup, for sure
