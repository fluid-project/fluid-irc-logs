2016-05-26T15:16:42 <the-t-in-rtf> OK, I had enough time to try something but not enough time to slog through a big thing, so I looked at Karma.

2016-05-26T15:17:16 <the-t-in-rtf> This is the currently blocker, i.e their qunit runner does not actually import the test fixtures
2016-05-26T15:17:24 <the-t-in-rtf> I am working on it now in the last few minutes I have today.
2016-05-26T15:17:39 <the-t-in-rtf> currently the blocker

2016-05-26T15:21:51 <the-t-in-rtf> That plugin seems of very low value with that bug, looking for other approaches within the community now.
2016-05-26T15:22:24 <the-t-in-rtf> "everything is fine as long as you only work the way we do" seems to be their attitude, it\'s pretty disgraceful.
2016-05-26T15:23:42 <the-t-in-rtf> This is the only approach I\'ve found so far, but it\'s disgusting.

2016-05-26T15:26:33 <the-t-in-rtf> Also disgusting.
2016-05-26T15:26:48 <the-t-in-rtf> Testem is miles better in this regard.

2016-05-26T15:28:52 <the-t-in-rtf> Ugh, here is one "fix" coming from the team: https://github.com/karma-runner/karma/issues/2151

2016-05-26T15:32:07 <the-t-in-rtf> OK, 2151 is the best we can hope for:
2016-05-26T15:32:07 <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/karma-runner/karma/issues/2151
2016-05-26T15:32:48 <the-t-in-rtf> I was really hoping someone more familiar with rolling up multiple QUnit tests would be awake and on-list.
2016-05-26T15:32:50 <the-t-in-rtf> @bosmon
2016-05-26T15:33:39 <the-t-in-rtf> I am willing to keep experimenting once they cut the release with 2151, as they do really seem to have much easier integration with istanbul.
2016-05-26T15:34:31 <the-t-in-rtf> The way they handle includes is interesting but kind of a pain, as some of our libraries really need to be loaded in the right order.
2016-05-26T15:34:32 * alanharnum has quit
2016-05-26T15:35:13 <the-t-in-rtf> Not being able to include our own HTML means we have to tell them about all our client-side deps in exactly the right order and in a longish format.
2016-05-26T15:37:03 <the-t-in-rtf> Hmm, looks like I could follow an approach similar to what we use here: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/tests/all-tests.html
2016-05-26T15:37:53 <the-t-in-rtf> I could use that even with the state it\'s in now, I\'d just have a karma-facing js file that called QUnit.testSuites
2016-05-26T15:38:18 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, I have to pack up but hope to spike that tomorrow, as I will only have an hour at best.
