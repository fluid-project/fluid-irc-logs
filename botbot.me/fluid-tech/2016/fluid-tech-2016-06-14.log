2016-06-14T19:39:29 <Bosmon> cindyli - suggests that nothing got into the termMap at all
2016-06-14T19:39:34 <Bosmon> By that point the URL should be completely correct
2016-06-14T19:39:40 <Bosmon> Not just a template for a URL
2016-06-14T19:39:49 <cindyli> ok, i see
2016-06-14T19:39:51 <cindyli> oh, no
2016-06-14T19:40:20 <Bosmon> Well, maybe I\'m misreading resolveURL
2016-06-14T19:40:33 <Bosmon> It passes through here: https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/blob/master/lib/dataSource-node.js#L222
2016-06-14T19:40:55 <cindyli> should debug after this line?
2016-06-14T19:41:05 <Bosmon> Well, everything should already be in the logs
2016-06-14T19:41:26 <Bosmon> This line: https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/blob/master/lib/dataSource-node.js#L309
2016-06-14T19:41:36 <Bosmon> Already dumps complete contents of "requestOptions"
2016-06-14T19:42:30 <cindyli> tried, same: %baseUrl/%dbName/%userId
2016-06-14T19:42:32 <cindyli> no
2016-06-14T19:43:19 <cindyli> yes, that request option value is:
2016-06-14T19:43:41 <cindyli> http://pastebin.com/FQkr8D3d
2016-06-14T19:44:09 <cindyli> Bosmon: u can see the "url" is still the template, but the "path" option is resolved
2016-06-14T19:44:17 <cindyli> with actual termMap values being applied
2016-06-14T19:44:26 <Bosmon> cindyli - yes, ok
2016-06-14T19:44:32 <Bosmon> The problem is with your "baseUrl" hack
2016-06-14T19:44:36 <Bosmon> the URL has become double-encoded
2016-06-14T19:44:40 <Bosmon> And you need to get rid of that anyway
2016-06-14T19:44:45 <cindyli> ok
2016-06-14T19:45:12 <cindyli> how to prevent double-encoding from happening?
2016-06-14T19:45:14 <Bosmon> You can see that the encoding is wrong on line 11
2016-06-14T19:45:26 <Bosmon> cindyli - you shouldn\'t try to pass "baseUrl" through the templating system
2016-06-14T19:45:32 <cindyli> ah
2016-06-14T19:45:32 <Bosmon> That material should just be in the template
2016-06-14T19:45:42 <cindyli> ok
2016-06-14T19:45:55 <Bosmon> If you really want this, you can supply the "noencode:" prefix, but that just makes the workflow even more messy
2016-06-14T19:47:15 <cindyli> Bosmon: i expect the baseUrl to be passed from the gpii config file, so, should i add another layer to first compose the template using the passed-in baseUrl
2016-06-14T19:47:38 <cindyli> so it won\'t be needed in termMap
2016-06-14T19:47:42 <cindyli> trying...
2016-06-14T19:49:27 <Bosmon> cindyli - no, if it\'s passed in from the config file, you should just write a distribution to pass it in
2016-06-14T19:49:58 <cindyli> Bosmon: yes, but now it\'s passed into the termMap
2016-06-14T19:51:05 <cindyli> https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/GPII-1274/gpii/node_modules/gpii-oauth2/gpii-oauth2-datastore/src/DbDataStore.js#L41
2016-06-14T19:52:04 <cindyli> i guess i need to pass in "baseUrl" as an option and concat it with the url template

2016-06-14T20:04:37 <cindyli> Bosmon: removed baseUrl out of termMap. still getting an empty object, i guess which is "not found" as well since i turn on "notFoundIsEmpty" option. now the request options look like this - http://pastebin.com/Hn92inyb
2016-06-14T20:04:43 <cindyli> do you see something insane?
2016-06-14T20:05:59 <cindyli> the "path" value is "/gpiiOauth/user-1". shall it be "http://localhost:1234/gpiiOauth/user-1"?
2016-06-14T20:08:12 <Bosmon> cindyli - your request looks good now
2016-06-14T20:08:23 <cindyli> super
2016-06-14T20:08:41 <Bosmon> I suspect that now the reason is that the record really isn\'t there
2016-06-14T20:09:18 <cindyli> umm.. if i turn on the commented test, the record is returned
2016-06-14T20:09:27 <cindyli> :\'(
2016-06-14T20:10:17 <Bosmon> Well, if it really returns the record, that will return a log message too!
2016-06-14T20:10:21 <Bosmon> You can paste it and then we can compare them
2016-06-14T20:11:11 <Bosmon> cindyli - here is the relevant options structure btw: https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_http_request_options_callback
2016-06-14T20:11:49 <cindyli> nice. thanks
2016-06-14T20:12:12 * clown joined the channel
2016-06-14T20:12:47 <cindyli> it explains what should "path" look like.
2016-06-14T20:12:58 * clown has quit
2016-06-14T20:13:43 <cindyli> fixing the encoding problem also removes the necessity of providing the "protocol" option. cool
