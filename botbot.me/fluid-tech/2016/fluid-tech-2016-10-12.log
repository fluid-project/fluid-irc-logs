2016-10-12T13:53:34 <the-t-in-rtf> Hi, All.  I\'m having lots of issues with gpii-handlebars and infusion master, related to not being able to find content once markup is replaced.
2016-10-12T13:54:04 * kasparnet has quit
2016-10-12T13:54:05 <the-t-in-rtf> previously I was advised by @Bosmon to use fluid.initDomBinder() after changing the markup, that doesn\'t seem to be enough any more.
2016-10-12T13:54:25 <the-t-in-rtf> Do I also now need to use the `clear` method?
2016-10-12T13:54:28 <the-t-in-rtf> http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/DOMBinderAPI.html#clear
2016-10-12T13:55:17 * kasparnet joined the channel
2016-10-12T13:56:30 <the-t-in-rtf> i.e. that.dom.clear()
2016-10-12T13:58:53 <the-t-in-rtf> It seems like initDomBinder should be enough, but I\'m getting errors in locating markup that I can obviously see exists.
2016-10-12T14:01:25 <alanharnum> the-t-in-rtf: fluid.initDomBinder() has definitely been enough for me in the past

2016-10-12T14:43:05 <the-t-in-rtf> @alanharnum, have you tried anything like that against master and/or a new enough version that has jQuery 3.0?
2016-10-12T14:43:16 <alanharnum> the-t-in-rtf: not recently, no
2016-10-12T14:43:43 <the-t-in-rtf> it always "just worked" for me, I am getting in touch because it immediately broke when I started working with master to pick up my recent PR.
2016-10-12T14:48:49 <alanharnum> the-t-in-rtf: does it work if you add dom.clear() into the mix?
2016-10-12T14:49:06 <the-t-in-rtf> in meetings, will try that shortly.
2016-10-12T14:49:22 <the-t-in-rtf> however, given that initDomBinder is completely replacing that.dom, I\'m a bit skeptical
2016-10-12T14:49:35 <the-t-in-rtf> unless there is something very wrong with the caching.
