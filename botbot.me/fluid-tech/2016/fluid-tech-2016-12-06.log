b"2016-12-06T17:47:39 <gtirloni> looks like, as happened with the nodejs package, the EPEL maintainers are picking up the pace (just learned this expression recently!!)... there are new nginx packages. this causes a problem: https://trac.nginx.org/nginx/ticket/1147#ticket
2016-12-06T17:47:40 <amatas> gtirloni, they are not populated again, in fact, if you remove the .vagrant directory when a VM is running you won't be able to destroy or shutdown using Vagrant because all the metadata would be missing.
2016-12-06T17:48:17 <gtirloni> amatas: i mean, the temporary files you would store in /tmp/vagrant-XXX... since the is erased after a reboot. is that okay for end users?
2016-12-06T17:48:36 <amatas> mm, I don't think so

2016-12-06T14:12:26 <gtirloni> no, the workaround for xorg with the latest versions of virtualbox 5.0... i think you mentioned it was needed
2016-12-06T14:12:32 <amatas> sorry, today is holiday in Spain, and I have more family at home than usual

2016-12-06T14:30:54 <amatas> gtirloni, I guess that the latest VBox tools should fix the issue. I remember that my fix was to use the trunk version of the tools in my build system.
2016-12-06T14:31:15 <gtirloni> amatas: ah ok, that\'s great. i thought we had to patch something ourselves. cool, thanks!

2016-12-06T14:37:16 <michelled> we got a mic today, so we thought the audio would be better
2016-12-06T14:37:20 <michelled> but apparently it isn\'t
2016-12-06T14:37:24 <michelled> we are trying to fix it now
2016-12-06T14:37:39 <gtirloni> thanks
2016-12-06T14:37:40 <michelled> the plan today is to go through the JIRAs in this filter: https://issues.gpii.net/issues/?filter=13200
2016-12-06T14:37:56 <michelled> these should be *all* the remaining work for the project
2016-12-06T14:38:11 <michelled> meaning, when we are done the project in 2018, all of these JIRAs should be closed
2016-12-06T14:38:46 <michelled> so today, we will determine if all of these are required, update their status, and add any that are missing

2016-12-06T14:47:28 <gtirloni> amatas: nice!!! i\'ll give it a try later today
2016-12-06T14:47:44 <amatas> you can give a try if you want. It only needs the .qi.yml file

2016-12-06T15:03:26 <gtirloni> michelled: the infrastructure JIRAs were created together, they are all linked to GPII-2009
2016-12-06T15:03:43 <gtirloni> maybe not all, but 95%
2016-12-06T15:10:33 <amatas> gtirloni, I think we could do all the tests of the Jekins master role in a VM, because I splitted the role in two: https://github.com/amatas/ansible-jenkins-node and https://github.com/amatas/ansible-jenkins-master . Only the ansible-jenkins-node needs the bare metal to run VirtualBox.
2016-12-06T15:12:29 <gtirloni> ok. the only thing we may not be abl to test with a VM is the xorg/vbox.. but we can do some initial testing (that the role applies ok at least). it\'s going to take a while to have a physical box (we need to re-wire a bunch of stuff in the datacenter right now)
2016-12-06T15:13:41 <amatas> gtirloni, do you think that we could use the actual h-0005 to do so?, using a different user or something like that.
2016-12-06T15:14:29 <gtirloni> if we can isolate it to a test user, yeah, that\'s doable!
2016-12-06T15:14:42 <gtirloni> does the jenkins-node role do any system-wide changes?
2016-12-06T15:14:56 <amatas> let me check
2016-12-06T15:15:59 <amatas> kasparnet, https://github.com/kevva/brightness <-- following a link that Gio sent before
2016-12-06T15:16:33 <amatas> stegru, ^^^
2016-12-06T15:22:01 <amatas> gtirloni, I don\'t think that the jenkins-node needs system-wide changes, at least if we use the ssh launch method. Because it only needs an user with ssh access at the node machine.
2016-12-06T15:22:41 <gtirloni> cool, that\'ll do then
2016-12-06T15:22:50 <amatas> the ansible-jenkins-node role only installs the jenkins-client.jar and launches it as a service. But it is not required in our setup.
2016-12-06T15:26:51 <amatas> nice gtirloni , although it seems that there is not rush for this task, do you have a VM available to perform the master-role tests?
2016-12-06T15:30:51 <stegru> thanks amatas !
2016-12-06T15:33:36 <amatas> yw :)
2016-12-06T15:35:51 <gtirloni> amatas: i think we\'ve created i-0037, i-0038 and i-0039 for that
2016-12-06T15:39:18 <amatas> thanks gtirloni, I see that there is some Jenkins\' stuff running on them, could I break things in the vms?
2016-12-06T15:40:22 * colinclark has quit
2016-12-06T15:40:23 <gtirloni> amatas: i think so. the only VMs that are in production are i-0010 (fluid), i-0011 (gpii) and i-0012 (idi)... and i-0044 (tony exclusive!)

2016-12-06T17:27:04 <amatas> avtar, have you tried to set the "git_strategy" option to none to avoid the workaround steps in the gitlab ci jobs to preserve the vagrant directory between steps? I realised that option recently https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/ci/yaml/#git-strategy
2016-12-06T17:29:39 <avtar> amatas: interesting, no i haven\'t
2016-12-06T17:30:17 <avtar> sounds like some work might be required beforehand then to ensure a clean and up to date git working directory is used before the ci job starts
2016-12-06T17:30:55 <avtar> also: "Introduced in GitLab 8.9 as an experimental feature.  May change or be removed   completely in future releases. "
2016-12-06T17:30:56 <avtar> :/
2016-12-06T17:32:38 <avtar> sounds like it\'s worth a shot regardless
2016-12-06T17:32:45 <avtar> hopefully they\'ll keep that feature around
2016-12-06T17:33:18 <gtirloni> these days i just assume that by default (that things will break) :)
2016-12-06T17:33:53 <gtirloni> i guess their "LTS" release is "gitlab enterprise", right?
2016-12-06T17:33:57 <amatas> the thing is, do we prefer to clean the environment before run the steps, or is it better to start from a clean environment and keep the vagrant directory between steps?
2016-12-06T17:34:16 <avtar> gtirloni: yes
2016-12-06T17:34:27 <gtirloni> amatas: if the plugin is storing files in .vagrant, then i clean one i guess
2016-12-06T17:34:38 <gtirloni> i don\'t know what else gets stored there
2016-12-06T17:35:05 <avtar> amatas: i think we would want a clean environment at the beginning of the job
2016-12-06T17:35:21 <amatas> the .vagrant is used to store some metadata about the running VMs
2016-12-06T17:35:48 <amatas> avtar, I prefer that option as well
2016-12-06T17:36:14 <avtar> that\'s assuming a single vm is involved and making use of the working directory, potentially altering the file system state (node_modules, generating reports, and so on) -- this will of course change with multiple VMs
2016-12-06T17:36:32 <avtar> when one vm goes away the second vm won\'t have a clean slate to work with

2016-12-06T17:41:34 <amatas> gtirloni, thinking about the plugin, I think I could set the vagrant working directory in /tmp/vagrant-XXX or something similar, avoiding the actual workaround in the gitlab-ci
2016-12-06T17:44:59 <gtirloni> those files would be populated again if they`re missing when \'vagrant up\' is running? is it time-consuming? for the CI server it\'s okay I think.. just wondering how\'d go for end users
