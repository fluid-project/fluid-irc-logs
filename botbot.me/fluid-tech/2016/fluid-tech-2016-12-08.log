2016-12-08T10:07:27 <the-t-in-rtf> @gtirloni @amatas, if I just want to fire up a windows VM to try something, what\'s the box name when using our standard QI config files and vagrant-vmenv?
2016-12-08T10:08:12 <the-t-in-rtf> The windows repo is using its own Vagrantfile, and "winrm": https://github.com/GPII/windows/blob/master/Vagrantfile#L16
2016-12-08T10:08:14 <the-t-in-rtf> Is that right?
2016-12-08T10:10:21 <the-t-in-rtf> OK, trying that resulted in an error message that led me to the configs.
2016-12-08T10:10:28 <the-t-in-rtf> Is there a ticket to add windows tests to QI?
2016-12-08T10:11:06 <the-t-in-rtf> Also, is there a good starting Vagrantfile to launch Windows with node + yarn + java?
2016-12-08T10:14:54 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, I created a ticket to add a windows image as a supported option in vagrant-vmenv: https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2171
2016-12-08T10:15:35 <the-t-in-rtf> For now I will just launch a VM from the Windows repo and manually tweak it, I just need to try something out.

2016-12-08T14:58:57 <gloob> super one-liner
2016-12-08T14:59:20 <amatas> :D thanks

2016-12-08T15:10:09 <amatas> I always believed that a token can be revoked by the user, and the he can create a new one in the case that the old was stolen.

2016-12-08T15:24:35 <gloob> amatas: probably but that is the initial part of the problem, the problem seems to find the correct balance between easy to use and secure enough and filter all of our current data exchange streams
2016-12-08T15:25:02 * colinclark joined the channel
2016-12-08T15:26:02 <amatas> so I guess that is a problem of which authentication method has the best balance between easy of use and security
2016-12-08T15:26:53 <amatas> because I understand that the GPII token is interpreted as an authentication method, and the oauth token as an authority method
2016-12-08T15:27:56 <amatas> well, the credit cards uses a "pin" of 4 numbers to unlock the chip that authorizes the money transaction :D

2016-12-08T17:24:51 <the-t-in-rtf> Hi, All.  As I will need to skip the afternoon session, just wanted to share my two concerns around logging.
2016-12-08T17:24:54 * alanharnum has quit
2016-12-08T17:25:38 <the-t-in-rtf> 1. We need to ensure that we aren\'t logging sensitive information.  Specifically, the logging in kettle.dataSource.URL means that you end up with user payloads in your logs if you\'re at the default log level.
2016-12-08T17:26:01 <the-t-in-rtf> We need a way to contain and prevent that kind of spillage.
2016-12-08T17:26:23 <the-t-in-rtf> 2. It would be nice to have finer-grained control over what you see, namespaced log channels, for example.
2016-12-08T17:27:18 <the-t-in-rtf> So, for example, I can explicitly turn off kettle.dataSource.URL logging below a certain level before making a request
2016-12-08T17:27:35 <the-t-in-rtf> or I could increase the logging for a single namespace when troubleshooting problems.
2016-12-08T17:30:15 * clown has quit
2016-12-08T17:31:41 <the-t-in-rtf> We also need to figure out how to avoid someone in a deeper part of code changing the log levels.
2016-12-08T17:32:12 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, I will check in on the list once my son is down to see if I can join the discussion after 20:30, but just wanted to share.
