2016-07-19T11:13:57 <amatas> hi gtirloni, is the ci working fine? I see all the tests "passed".
2016-07-19T11:14:32 <gtirloni> hi! i believe so
2016-07-19T11:15:25 <gtirloni> let me trigger a few builds just in case
2016-07-19T11:27:05 <amatas> all in green \\o/
2016-07-19T11:28:24 <gtirloni> yea, i think the CI infrastructure is fine. it\'s curious the windows tests passed yesterday though. i wonder if the fixes were committed
2016-07-19T11:28:39 * alanharnum joined the channel
2016-07-19T11:28:41 <gtirloni> it\'s possible a given PR passes tests, while the master branch doesn\'t

2016-07-19T12:57:12 <gloob> gtirloni: as far as I know currently master will fail if we are re-creating the vm
2016-07-19T12:57:45 <gloob> in fact I wast thinking to send a PR to make it all green in master, because it\'s a windows bug, so we will need to handle it :(
2016-07-19T12:57:56 <avtar> hi all
2016-07-19T12:58:03 <gloob> yellow
2016-07-19T12:58:37 <avtar> i think the windows PRs that resulted in rolling green hills were older
2016-07-19T12:58:42 <gloob> yes
2016-07-19T12:58:43 <avtar> windows tests passed at one point
2016-07-19T12:58:54 <gloob> in fact the last one executed is the older
2016-07-19T12:58:59 <avtar> yup
2016-07-19T13:01:09 <gtirloni> in the future we won\'t need to worry.. if a new PR or master fails to build, we\'ll know when the breakage was introduced. right now with older PR is still requires some thinking going back/forth to understand where in the timeline it is
2016-07-19T13:01:33 <gloob> agree
2016-07-19T13:02:01 <gloob> although probably will makes sense to do from older to newer in a batch process, although don\'t care so much
2016-07-19T13:02:22 <gloob> although is my favorite word this days

2016-07-19T15:01:57 <clown> if there isn\'t one, I\'ll create it.

2016-07-19T18:00:51 <clown> avtar, got a moment?  I\'m getting errors when trying to provision/run the linux vagrant VM.
2016-07-19T18:01:27 <avtar> clown: sure
2016-07-19T18:01:33 <clown> This task is failing:  "==> default: TASK [nodejs : Run application related commands as the application user] *******"
2016-07-19T18:01:43 <clown> dunno why.
2016-07-19T18:01:54 <clown> very long error message...
2016-07-19T18:01:54 <avtar> do you have a gist/paste of the full output?
2016-07-19T18:02:08 <clown> good idea.  I\'ll paste it.

2016-07-19T18:12:06 <avtar> out of curiosity, have you tried destroying this vm and recreating it?
2016-07-19T18:13:26 <clown> avtar, yes I have destroyed the vm and started from scratch.
2016-07-19T18:16:34 <avtar> clown: are you working with gpii/linux master or a fork and branch of yours?
2016-07-19T18:16:47 <clown> I\'m working with gpii/linux master.
2016-07-19T18:17:17 <avtar> hmm
2016-07-19T18:17:26 <avtar> one sec, let me try this on my end
2016-07-19T18:17:31 <clown> avtar, just had an idea\xe2\x80\xa6
2016-07-19T18:17:43 <clown> does it matter what branch of univeral I am on?
2016-07-19T18:17:52 <clown> *universal
2016-07-19T18:19:11 <avtar> you shouldn\'t have to manually manage a local copy of universal now that it\'s installed using npm https://github.com/GPII/linux/blob/master/package.json#L9
2016-07-19T18:19:32 <avtar> or am i misunderstanding your question?
2016-07-19T18:19:40 <clown> that\'s what I thought.  But, just in case, if I do have a local copy of universal, does it matter?
2016-07-19T18:21:27 <avtar> clown: i don\'t think it would matter in the provisioning phase since we wouldn\'t use it
2016-07-19T18:21:46 <clown> makes sense to me, avtar
2016-07-19T18:21:53 <avtar> i\'m assuming your copy is ../node_modules/universal relative to your linux directory
2016-07-19T18:21:59 <clown> right.
2016-07-19T18:22:08 <avtar> yeah that shouldn\'t affect npm
2016-07-19T18:22:33 <clown> good
2016-07-19T18:30:44 <clown> avtar, I have to switch to a telecon for the next little while.  I\'ll touch base with you later to see if you have the solution.
2016-07-19T18:31:08 <avtar> clown: "it works for me" https://gist.github.com/anonymous/492262494ba45c4b05d81f7e2ebd2bc2#file-gistfile1-txt-L160-L162

2016-07-19T18:47:05 <gtirloni> clown_mtg: have you run `npm install` outside vagrant by any chance?
2016-07-19T18:49:13 <clown_mtg> gtirloni:  not within the VM.  What I did: (1) \'vagrant destroy\' the old VM, (2)  \'git pull\' to make sure I had the latest master gpii/linux branch, and (3) vagrant up.
2016-07-19T18:49:57 <gtirloni> i\'d try to delete any node_modules dir you may have
2016-07-19T18:51:47 <clown_mtg> gtirloni:  ah, that makes sense if you mean any existent node_modules directory in my linux folder.  Yes, I guess that neither a vagrant destroy, nor a git pull is going to affect it.
2016-07-19T18:51:58 <gtirloni> correct
2016-07-19T18:52:41 <clown_mtg> gtirloni: okay, I\'ll try that after my telecon.
2016-07-19T18:53:28 * clown_mtg wonder if "manually remove the node_modules directory when you update your VM" is one of those things that one just has to remember to do.
2016-07-19T18:53:36 <clown_mtg> thanks gtirloni

2016-07-19T19:23:40 <gtirloni> avtar: looks good to me. quick question: would it make sense to let ghprb point directly to the failed build\'s URL?
2016-07-19T19:25:52 <avtar> gtirloni: yeah that makes sense
2016-07-19T19:26:05 <gtirloni> it doesn\'t seem obvious how to that though
2016-07-19T19:26:36 <avtar> i had that text in when jenkins was still sitting behind that static archive
2016-07-19T19:27:02 <avtar> gtirloni: maybe using the BUILD_URL environment variable https://ci.gpii.net/env-vars.html/
2016-07-19T19:27:13 <gtirloni> ah that\'d make a lot of sense (when it had the static archive, it was a pain)

2016-07-19T19:48:33 <avtar> when it can be tested on another jenkins instance
2016-07-19T19:48:50 <gtirloni> makes sense. the docs aren\'t super clear about env vars in those messages

2016-07-19T20:36:22 <gtirloni> cool, glad it worked
2016-07-19T20:36:24 <clown> only thing I see is this warning ":==> default:  [WARNING]: Consider using synchronize module rather than running rsync"
2016-07-19T20:41:04 <clown> gtirloni ^
2016-07-19T20:41:32 <clown> Here\'s more context:
2016-07-19T20:41:34 <clown> ==> default: TASK [nodejs : Copy application directory contents to temporary build directory if a Vagrant environment is being used] ***
2016-07-19T20:41:34 <clown> ==> default: changed: [localhost]
2016-07-19T20:41:34 <clown> ==> default:  [WARNING]: Consider using synchronize module rather than running rsync
2016-07-19T20:48:03 <gtirloni> you can ignore that
2016-07-19T20:48:26 <gtirloni> they want us to use the \'synchronize\' module from ansible, but it doesn\'t have all the features from running rsync directly
2016-07-19T20:50:07 <clown> those mysterious "they" people\xe2\x80\xa6
2016-07-19T20:50:12 <clown> ignored.
