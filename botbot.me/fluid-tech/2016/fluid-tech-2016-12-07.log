2016-12-07T11:37:28 <gtirloni> amatas: fyi, i updated h-0005  with vbox 5.0.30, vagrant 1.9.0 and node 6.9.2 today
2016-12-07T11:40:15 <amatas> :D that explains this https://botbot.me/freenode/fluid-work/2016-12-07/?msg=77604192&page=1
2016-12-07T11:41:12 <amatas> I believe that I triggered the tests while you were updating virtualbox and vagrant
2016-12-07T11:42:23 <gtirloni> i noticed your session had been idle for >90min (didn see child processes). i did see stuck vbox processes though (no cpu usage)
2016-12-07T11:42:40 <gtirloni> did you have to fix anything because of that?
2016-12-07T11:42:42 <amatas> gtirloni, JFYI https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2016-8655
2016-12-07T11:43:44 <amatas> gtirloni, let me make some checks, Tony\'s trying to run some tests and they are failing because vagrant is not working properly.
2016-12-07T11:44:06 <gtirloni> ok. i updated it using the official rpm.
2016-12-07T11:44:56 <amatas> ok ok
2016-12-07T11:45:01 <gtirloni> thanks for the heads up about the kernel bug. i\'m subscribed to centos-announce@, waiting for the packages to be released (it\'ll probably take another 2-3 days)
2016-12-07T11:47:16 <amatas> Ok, it seems that virtualbox processes have died in h-0005
2016-12-07T11:47:44 <amatas> that\'s why vagrant is not able to connect with them
2016-12-07T11:48:00 <amatas> gtirloni, could I reboot h-0005?
2016-12-07T11:48:11 <amatas> in order to reload vbox kernel modules
2016-12-07T11:48:30 <gtirloni> sure!
2016-12-07T11:49:11 <gtirloni> we had vagrant 1.8.7 before, in case downgrading helps
2016-12-07T11:49:36 <gtirloni> btw, the c2100\'s take about 3min to fully boot.. don\'t panic :)
2016-12-07T11:51:27 <amatas> thanks, I was tarting to sweat
2016-12-07T11:51:34 <amatas> starting*
2016-12-07T11:52:06 <gtirloni> when i started at the idrc, i\'d get very anxious every time i had to reboot these machines.. but they have been reliable. i can\'t remember the last time i used the console access (h-0005 has it too)
2016-12-07T11:54:10 <amatas> I was also using the idrac before you, also the update of the Arista switch made me get nervous. :D
2016-12-07T11:56:40 <gtirloni> hmm it\'s taking a bit too long
2016-12-07T11:57:23 <amatas> http://i1.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/006/482/template.jpg
2016-12-07T11:58:23 <amatas> My PR has been merged: https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/pull/2150
2016-12-07T11:59:41 <gtirloni> i logged through the local adm network and restarted the team0 interface (public), seems to be okay now... no idea what\xc5\x9b wrong (both ifaces in the team were up).. maybe a switch thing.
2016-12-07T11:59:54 <gtirloni> amatas: congrats! you\'re now a yarn contributor \\o/
2016-12-07T12:00:00 <amatas> haha
2016-12-07T12:00:14 <amatas> I\'m in h-0005, thanks!
2016-12-07T12:01:20 <gtirloni> https://gist.github.com/gtirloni/26ffe1b74f68a9da03026b18c9edaf8a
2016-12-07T12:01:58 <amatas> oh, that was the error I got before
2016-12-07T12:02:20 <gtirloni> i ran `vagrant plugin repair` on my user and it works now
2016-12-07T12:02:34 <amatas> I believe that the version installed of winrm plugin is not compatible with the latest version of vagrant
2016-12-07T12:02:57 <amatas> you can also run "vagrant plugin install vagrant-winrm" as the user that gets the error
2016-12-07T12:03:00 <gtirloni> i vaguely remember something about winrm support being added to vagrant-core.. not sure
2016-12-07T12:03:21 <gtirloni> ok,installed vagrant-winrm 0.7.0
2016-12-07T12:03:24 <amatas> mmm, you are right, maybe the vagrant-winrm plugin is no longer needed
2016-12-07T12:05:57 <gtirloni> ok,i\xe1\xb8\xbf trying to start a win10 box.. let\'s see
2016-12-07T12:06:13 <gtirloni> (using the regular Vagrantfile, without qienv)
2016-12-07T12:07:23 <amatas> ok, let me know if everything works fine
2016-12-07T12:08:39 <gtirloni> cool, it started. i also uninstalled the winrm plugin on my user.. and vagrant seems to be able to connect using winrm just fine
2016-12-07T12:09:05 <gtirloni> i wonder if the `vagrant plugin repair` is necessary for all users.. it\'s the first time i ever hear about it
2016-12-07T12:09:17 <amatas> ok, I\'ll uninstall it from the rest of the users
2016-12-07T12:12:54 <gtirloni> amatas: this is what repair does -- https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/blob/5b1b18d01a61604103cbe6bebe1fe689b0b7d3b3/lib/vagrant/bundler.rb#L34-L68
2016-12-07T12:14:01 <gtirloni> i wish i understood what it\'s doing :P
2016-12-07T12:14:28 <gtirloni> maybe some internal activation order.. i\'m only guessing from the comments
2016-12-07T12:19:00 <gtirloni> amatas: looks like your plugin is working fine!

2016-12-07T17:20:15 <cindyli> Bosmon, Bosmon5, i\'m using kettle.dataSource.url.writable to send a PUT request to couchDB to create a database. the special thing with this request is that it doesn\'t need to carry any data and no http header on "Content-Type" and "Content-Length" are needed. so i use "kettle.dataSource.encoding.none" for encoding. however, an error is thrown at this line https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/blob/master/lib/dataSource-url.js#L216, complaining "dat
2016-12-07T17:20:36 <cindyli> seems kettle.dataSource.url.writable is always expecting "data"
2016-12-07T17:21:08 <cindyli> so i wonder, shall I use the data source read grade "kettle.dataSource.url" for this kind of operation
2016-12-07T17:21:23 <cindyli> although PUT more sounds like a write operation
2016-12-07T17:21:54 * alanharnum joined the channel
2016-12-07T17:22:12 <cindyli> or a check on the presence of "data" should be added for the writable grade before line 216?
2016-12-07T17:23:04 <cindyli> so "kettle.dataSource.url.writable" can continue to be used in this case?
