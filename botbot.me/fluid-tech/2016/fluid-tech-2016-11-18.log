2016-11-18T16:38:31 <gtirloni> cindyli: if you need to update virtualbox on any other OSX machines, this is the installer I used yesterday: https://www.virtualbox.org/download/testcase/VirtualBox-5.1.9-111957-OSX.dmg
2016-11-18T16:46:13 <cindyli> yes, gtirloni, digged out that version which also fixed the "connection closed" problem on my home machine, but "vagrant provision" hits this error at a later stage: http://pastebin.com/9UQKjrue

2016-11-18T16:52:39 <gtirloni> cindyli: looks like something installed an \'acorn\' executable that some other package also wants to install... so npm is refusing to remove the old file to put the new one in place.
2016-11-18T16:52:46 <gtirloni> cindyli: is that with gpii/windows\' master branch?
2016-11-18T16:53:05 <cindyli> yes, gtirloni
2016-11-18T16:53:49 <gtirloni> ok, i see there were some updates from the last time I tried that branch.. i\'ll try again here
2016-11-18T16:54:58 <cindyli> thanks, gtirloni

2016-11-18T17:00:11 <alanharnum> interesting stuff from Chrome Dev Summit, especially about Javascript performance: https://adactio.com/journal/11512
2016-11-18T17:00:42 <alanharnum> "But there was also a very, very heavy focus on performance. I don\xe2\x80\x99t just mean performance at the shallow scale of file size and optimisation, but a genuine questioning of the impact of our developer workflows and tools."

2016-11-18T17:05:00 <cindyli> gtirloni: some ppl running into a similar issue with npm 3 - https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/9702
2016-11-18T17:07:12 <gtirloni> at this point, i think we should really move to yarn (it doesn\'t need to \'prune\' packages like npm)
2016-11-18T17:07:19 <gtirloni> my `vagrant up` is still running
2016-11-18T17:08:34 * michelled1 joined the channel
2016-11-18T17:08:59 <cindyli> thought yarn has problems with running postinstall, any progress on that?

2016-11-18T17:13:20 <gtirloni> i\'d be awesome if we could test gpii/windows on another OSX host
2016-11-18T17:13:48 <gtirloni> are you using the same OSX version at work and home?
