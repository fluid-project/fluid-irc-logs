2016-12-09T11:30:32 <amatas> reading!
2016-12-09T11:30:59 <amatas> 7-8min range (from 15-16min since early November) wow
2016-12-09T11:31:20 <gtirloni> all seems to be working fine here
2016-12-09T11:31:21 <amatas> where do you think that are the performance improvements?

2016-12-09T13:15:43 <amatas> no worries

2016-12-09T15:55:27 <the-t-in-rtf> @amatas @avtar @gtirloni_, This build succeeds locally but fails in QI: http://i-0044.tor1.inclusivedesign.ca/job/gpii-pouchdb-lucene-commands/43/console
2016-12-09T15:55:49 <the-t-in-rtf> Any advice would be appreciated.

2016-12-09T16:06:02 <gtirloni> the-t-in-rtf: let me check
2016-12-09T16:07:20 <the-t-in-rtf> I\'m restarting the gpii-express-user one at the moment
2016-12-09T16:07:30 <the-t-in-rtf> but all of them failed at the same point
2016-12-09T16:07:36 <the-t-in-rtf> there was a fourth one that failed at that point as well.
2016-12-09T16:08:00 <gtirloni> ok
2016-12-09T16:08:22 <the-t-in-rtf> The best way to find builds broken in this was is to look at the "All" tab and check the create jobs.
2016-12-09T16:08:29 <the-t-in-rtf> s/was/way/
2016-12-09T16:09:01 <the-t-in-rtf> rerunning the create didn\'t work.
2016-12-09T16:09:18 <the-t-in-rtf> I\'ll leave them alone for now, please let me know what you find.
2016-12-09T16:10:05 <gtirloni> will do

2016-12-09T16:22:21 <amatas> it seems that is not able to launch the vbox ui
2016-12-09T16:22:55 <amatas> or maybe I\'m wrong

2016-12-09T16:49:00 <gtirloni> amatas: i ran packer -build a few times and at some point it started to fail... could not start VM\'s anymore. same issue with vagrant builds. I\'ve restarted h-0005 and it looks like things are back to normal with vagrant/virtualbox (GPII/universal works). but I\'m getting this error from CI: http://i-0044.tor1.inclusivedesign.ca/job/create-gpii-webdriver-vm/26/console
2016-12-09T16:49:53 <gtirloni> vagrant-qienv 0.0.1 is installed, but it looks like this is using node_modules?
2016-12-09T16:51:18 * alanharnum has quit
2016-12-09T16:57:21 <gtirloni> i think i\'m may have messed up qienv.. it looks like the Vagrantfiles depend on vagrant-vmenv (i deleted it now, which caused a different issue)
2016-12-09T17:00:09 <gtirloni> ah, removed vagrant-qienv plugin and reinstalled node\'s vagrant-vmenv.. i think this is working now
2016-12-09T17:06:53 * Sitesh has quit
2016-12-09T17:07:38 <gtirloni> amatas: if `vagrant up` is started without "DISPLAY=:0" it fails.. this is expected. i see for test_cmds the display var is added but not for `vagrant up`, right?
2016-12-09T17:09:07 * michelled has quit
2016-12-09T17:09:53 <gtirloni> i guess the place to fix this in the jjb\'s definitions
2016-12-09T17:13:07 <gtirloni> ok, it\'s an update with an old version of the qi-config repo on i-0044, which doesn\'t have a fix to add DISPLAY=:0
2016-12-09T17:13:38 <gtirloni> i made a modification to it locally on i-0044 to try and fix the email for aborted builds.. going to update that and reconfig jenkins
2016-12-09T17:21:51 <gtirloni> amatas the-t-in-rtf: back to our regular scheduled programming. sorry about the disturbance.
