b'2015-10-27T15:57:32 <alanharnum> hm
2015-10-27T15:57:34 <colinclark> but I guess not if you\'re depending on a custom build
2015-10-27T15:57:34 <alanharnum> good question
2015-10-27T15:57:48 <alanharnum> it might be a good way to practice using the NPM release if nothing else
2015-10-27T15:58:07 <colinclark> I don\'t think there\'s much reason to practice it if doesn\'t do what you need
2015-10-27T15:58:19 <alanharnum> i\'m happy not to worry about it :)
2015-10-27T15:58:26 <alanharnum> but maybe at some point in the future
2015-10-27T15:58:27 <colinclark> alanharnum: You aren\'t depending on a particular versioned namespace, though, right?
2015-10-27T15:58:39 <colinclark> All of your code binds to "fluid" not to "fluid_x_y_z", right?
2015-10-27T15:58:52 <alanharnum> colinclark: no - I only noticed because it messed up the Infusion-based test modules
2015-10-27T15:58:59 <alanharnum> colinclark: yup
2015-10-27T15:59:04 <colinclark> alanharnum: My hope is that we\'ll someday have a build system that can be driven from npm scripts using extra metadata in the package.json file
2015-10-27T16:00:05 <alanharnum> from a dogfooding PoV, if we\'re publishing Infusion packages to NPM, we should target using NPM to source Infusion for projects like chartAuthoring that aren\'t in the main Infusion repo
2015-10-27T16:00:14 <alanharnum> so that makes sense to me
2015-10-27T16:02:37 <colinclark> Yes, I agree
2015-10-27T16:03:02 <colinclark> I think it should be doable to have some kind of an npm script that reads a special section of your package.json
2015-10-27T16:03:15 <colinclark> which would contain the kind of information that you are currently passing to the scripts manually
2015-10-27T16:03:36 <alanharnum> yes
2015-10-27T16:03:51 <colinclark> i.e. the list of components you want to package up
2015-10-27T16:04:03 <alanharnum> and also generates the VERSION.md file that I had thought was somehow programatically generated, but Justin_o told me is actually done by hand ;)
2015-10-27T16:04:09 <colinclark> hahaha
2015-10-27T16:04:10 * michelled has quit
2015-10-27T16:04:11 <colinclark> yes, that would be nice
2015-10-27T16:04:13 <colinclark> good idea
2015-10-27T16:05:08 <colinclark> I also imagine that we\'ll generate "standard" builds as part of a prepublish script
2015-10-27T16:05:13 <colinclark> right now, all my libraries do things like this:
2015-10-27T16:05:43 <colinclark> https://github.com/colinbdclark/Flocking/blob/master/Gruntfile.js#L8-L30
2015-10-27T16:07:23 <alanharnum> there was some discussion in the floe planning meeting yesterday about possible splitting things up further than they are currently
2015-10-27T16:07:39 <alanharnum> which, at least as someone relatively new to working with Infusion, makes sense to me
2015-10-27T16:08:23 <alanharnum> some of my early conceptual roadblocks were in understanding that Infusion is both a framework for building components and reusable components built with that framework
2015-10-27T16:09:05 <alanharnum> at least in my mind, i\'d want to have those clearly separated
2015-10-27T16:21:40 <colinclark> yup, that\'s definitely the plan

2015-10-27T17:36:32 <cindyli> kasparnet: fluid-work is busy, moving our conversation here, i\'ve renamed the file name to "firstOntology-flat.json", re-post to http://localhost:8081/preferences/?view=firstDiscovery
2015-10-27T17:36:45 <cindyli> response from the post:
2015-10-27T17:36:46 <cindyli> {
2015-10-27T17:36:46 <cindyli> "userToken": "70951763-041a-42a9-8be4-08e83087f54a",

2015-10-27T17:36:46 <cindyli> }
2015-10-27T17:36:46 <cindyli> }
2015-10-27T17:37:05 <cindyli> however, the response for the GET request on  localhost:8081/preferences/70951763-041a-42a9-8be4-08e83087f54a
2015-10-27T17:37:11 <cindyli> still,
2015-10-27T17:37:12 <cindyli> {
2015-10-27T17:37:12 <cindyli> "contexts": {}
2015-10-27T17:37:12 <cindyli> }
2015-10-27T17:39:37 <cindyli> same response from the GET with adding "?view=flat" or "?view=firstOntology"
2015-10-27T17:44:31 <cindyli> also tried using "?view=firstDiscovery", same empty response with "contexts" key
2015-10-27T17:46:50 <kasparnet> hmmm... that\'s weird
2015-10-27T17:47:12 <kasparnet> because you should get the proper response with the ?view=firstDiscovery parameter on GET
2015-10-27T17:48:43 <kasparnet> "contexts": {
2015-10-27T17:48:43 <kasparnet> "gpii-default": {
2015-10-27T17:48:43 <kasparnet> "name": "Default preferences",
2015-10-27T17:48:44 <kasparnet> "preferences": {
2015-10-27T17:48:48 <kasparnet> cindyli: could you try modifying your preferences set by wrapping it in
2015-10-27T17:48:57 <kasparnet> the above
2015-10-27T17:49:19 <kasparnet> so in contexts - gpii-default - preferences
2015-10-27T17:49:42 <kasparnet> ok - I think that was pretty confusing
2015-10-27T17:49:45 <kasparnet> I\'ll try again:
2015-10-27T17:50:01 <kasparnet> cindyli: could you try wrapping the preferences you\'re posting in:
2015-10-27T17:50:12 <kasparnet> \t"contexts": {
2015-10-27T17:50:12 <kasparnet> "gpii-default": {
2015-10-27T17:50:12 <kasparnet> "name": "Default preferences",
2015-10-27T17:50:14 <kasparnet> "preferences": {
2015-10-27T17:50:34 <kasparnet> and still post with ?view=firstOntology
2015-10-27T17:50:46 <kasparnet> and see if that works better?
2015-10-27T17:52:15 * michelled has quit
2015-10-27T17:56:03 <cindyli> certainly. trying out
2015-10-27T17:59:00 <cindyli> kasparnet: success! here\'s the response of the GET request to  localhost:8081/preferences/18735950-1d6a-43af-b772-ef091f81dd19?view=flat
2015-10-27T17:59:00 <cindyli> {
2015-10-27T17:59:00 <cindyli> "contexts": {
2015-10-27T17:59:01 <cindyli> "gpii-default": {
2015-10-27T17:59:01 <cindyli> "name": "Default preferences",
2015-10-27T17:59:01 <cindyli> "preferences": {
2015-10-27T17:59:01 <cindyli> "http://registry.gpii.net/common/language": "en-US"
2015-10-27T17:59:02 <cindyli> }
2015-10-27T17:59:02 <cindyli> }
2015-10-27T17:59:03 <cindyli> }
2015-10-27T17:59:03 <cindyli> }
2015-10-27T17:59:11 <kasparnet> oh cool
2015-10-27T17:59:29 <cindyli> response of using "?view=firstOntology"
2015-10-27T17:59:33 <cindyli> {
2015-10-27T17:59:33 <cindyli> "contexts": {
2015-10-27T17:59:33 <cindyli> "gpii-default": {
2015-10-27T17:59:33 <cindyli> "name": "Default preferences",
2015-10-27T17:59:33 <cindyli> "preferences": {
2015-10-27T17:59:33 <cindyli> "gpii_firstDiscovery_language": "en-US"
2015-10-27T17:59:33 <cindyli> }
2015-10-27T17:59:34 <cindyli> }
2015-10-27T17:59:34 <cindyli> }
2015-10-27T17:59:35 <cindyli> }
2015-10-27T18:00:00 <kasparnet> so I\'m sure Bosmon, colinclark and I have discussed this before --- but seeing it now, it does seem pretty sketchy to be forcing the use of contexts, etc. on anyone wanting to use the prefs server
2015-10-27T18:00:03 <cindyli> thanks, kasparnet. does it mean we need to wrap up the preference set with "contexts"..
2015-10-27T18:00:24 <kasparnet> yup
2015-10-27T18:00:34 <cindyli> ok
2015-10-27T18:01:03 <cindyli> this is very helpful, kasparnet. THANKS!
2015-10-27T18:01:39 <kasparnet> cindyli: no problem

2015-10-27T15:46:55 <colinclark> hey alanharnum, can I ask you a question?
2015-10-27T15:53:08 <alanharnum> colinclark: sure
2015-10-27T15:53:29 <colinclark> How come Justin_o\'s version number change pull request was a blocker for the Chart Authoring Tool?
2015-10-27T15:53:35 <colinclark> Was it just that you didn\'t want to update twice?
2015-10-27T15:56:54 <alanharnum> colinclark: basically, I made a new custom build of Infusion to include the overviewPanel for the demo
2015-10-27T15:57:16 <colinclark> Ah, okay
2015-10-27T15:57:29 <colinclark> I was going to ask if it would make sense to use npm to source Infusion in the Chart Authoring Tool
2015-10-27T15:57:29 <alanharnum> colinclark: the build had a bunch of namespace oddness ("infusion_2_0_0_beta_release_1")
