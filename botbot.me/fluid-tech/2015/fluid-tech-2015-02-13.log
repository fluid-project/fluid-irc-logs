2015-02-13T17:15:40 <cindyli> Bosmon: can protoTree render a string with new line chars in it?
2015-02-13T17:17:59 <Bosmon> cindyli - no reason why not
2015-02-13T17:18:08 <Bosmon> Assuming you have represented them within the JSON properly
2015-02-13T17:18:25 <Bosmon> But presumably this will have no particular effect within the markup
2015-02-13T17:18:34 <cindyli> tried with \\\
 but it renders as \
 instead of a new line char
2015-02-13T17:18:41 <Bosmon> Given newlines are just treated like any other whitespace
2015-02-13T17:19:09 * michelled has quit
2015-02-13T17:19:36 * michelled joined the channel
2015-02-13T17:19:46 <Bosmon> Well, that is what \\\
 means
2015-02-13T17:19:51 <Bosmon> I assume you actually meant to simply write \
 ?
2015-02-13T17:20:52 <cindyli> no, i meant to have it presented as a new line, Bosmon
2015-02-13T17:21:10 * michelled has quit
2015-02-13T17:21:31 <Bosmon> \
 is the encoding of the newline character
2015-02-13T17:21:34 <cindyli> \
 needs to be escaped when it\'s in a json file
2015-02-13T17:21:34 <cindyli> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/42068/how-do-i-handle-newlines-in-json
2015-02-13T17:21:41 * michelled joined the channel
2015-02-13T17:21:58 <cindyli> also tried with \
 in json, nothing gets printed out
2015-02-13T17:22:25 <cindyli> ok, i guess for now i will just use separate containers for each new line
2015-02-13T17:22:33 <Bosmon> cindyli - but nothing being printed out is correct
2015-02-13T17:22:42 <Bosmon> Since newlines are ignored in markup
2015-02-13T17:22:54 * michelled has quit
2015-02-13T17:22:55 <Bosmon> And that page you pasted to refers to encoding of JSON data within strings
2015-02-13T17:22:57 * the-t-in-rtf has quit
2015-02-13T17:23:02 <Bosmon> Not literal JSON data within code
2015-02-13T17:23:12 <cindyli> maybe i should encode <br />
2015-02-13T17:23:15 <cindyli> into json
2015-02-13T17:23:18 <cindyli> trying again
2015-02-13T17:23:20 * michelled joined the channel
2015-02-13T17:23:21 <Bosmon> cindyli - yes
2015-02-13T17:23:29 <Bosmon> That is the only effective way to encode line breaks in markup
2015-02-13T17:23:55 <cindyli> haha, of course, was starting with that, but it prints <br /> itself. i guess i didn\'t encode it properly
2015-02-13T17:24:13 <Bosmon> cindyli - you can use the UIVerbatim component to encode literal markup
2015-02-13T17:24:22 <Bosmon> Remember that anything you write in a standard renderer component will end up being escaped
2015-02-13T17:24:50 <Bosmon> I think you have been away from the markup coalface for too long :)
2015-02-13T17:24:59 * michelled has quit
2015-02-13T17:25:06 <cindyli> oh, do you mean if i encode <br /> into json, the encoded string will be printed rather than the new line?
2015-02-13T17:25:28 * michelled joined the channel
2015-02-13T17:25:41 <cindyli> agree on being away for too long ;)
2015-02-13T17:26:08 <Bosmon> cindyli - you need to use a UIVerbatim component, with the member named "markup"
2015-02-13T17:26:25 <Bosmon> Then when you write <br /> into the string, it will act as a piece of raw HTML markup
2015-02-13T17:26:34 <cindyli> ok, searching on that
2015-02-13T17:26:41 <Bosmon> I\'m sure Justin_o remembers this

2015-02-13T17:39:07 <Bosmon> cindyli - yes
2015-02-13T17:39:13 <Bosmon> By means of nesting UIMessage inside it
