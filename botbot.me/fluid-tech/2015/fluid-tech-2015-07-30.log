2015-07-30T11:56:00 <the-t-in-rtf> Is it safe to use the generated id of a fluid component in code?
2015-07-30T11:56:25 <the-t-in-rtf> I am writing a wrapper for a package, I will need to create an instance directory for it and want to ensure that it\'s possible to run multiple instances.
2015-07-30T11:56:43 <the-t-in-rtf> @bosmon
2015-07-30T11:57:48 <the-t-in-rtf> Basically I am creating a test component that has to launch a java application

2015-07-30T12:16:19 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - not clear on exactly what use you are planning to make of the id
2015-07-30T12:16:27 <the-t-in-rtf> I need a unique identifier to use to create a temporary directory that will house the component\'s couchdb-lucene filesystem content
2015-07-30T12:16:49 <the-t-in-rtf> there may be multiple instances running at any given time.
2015-07-30T12:17:04 <the-t-in-rtf> and they cannot share their working directories or configuration
2015-07-30T12:17:16 <Bosmon> ok
2015-07-30T12:17:24 <the-t-in-rtf> this is for the couchdb-lucene wrapper that spawns a process to run a java app
2015-07-30T12:17:30 <Bosmon> Well, fluid prefixes are generated from a space of 10^12 codes
2015-07-30T12:17:46 <Bosmon> Although they are only as good as Math.random is
2015-07-30T12:18:02 <the-t-in-rtf> Nearly any approach I could come up would be similarly as good.
2015-07-30T12:18:03 <Bosmon> It\'s probably adequate for this use case
2015-07-30T12:18:06 <the-t-in-rtf> Thanks.
2015-07-30T12:18:14 <the-t-in-rtf> Just wanted to make sure it wasn\'t going away.
2015-07-30T12:18:16 <Bosmon> You would need to generate a million of them before the chance of collision rose to 50%
2015-07-30T12:18:28 <the-t-in-rtf> I would run out of memory long before that.
2015-07-30T12:18:30 <Bosmon> No, you can treat that API as stable enough
2015-07-30T12:18:45 <the-t-in-rtf> this is a java object, I expect I would only be able to run a small handful in any case.
2015-07-30T12:19:03 <the-t-in-rtf> write once, run in every conceivable shred of your memory
2015-07-30T12:19:11 <Bosmon> :)
2015-07-30T12:19:21 <Bosmon> DId you see the recent "disk bomb" attack against the HTML local storage API?
2015-07-30T12:19:28 <the-t-in-rtf> noooo?
2015-07-30T12:19:39 <Bosmon> http://feross.org/fill-disk/
2015-07-30T12:19:40 <Bosmon> Here it is
2015-07-30T12:19:52 <Bosmon> Runs in all modern browsers except Firefox :)
2015-07-30T12:20:13 <the-t-in-rtf> No thanks, I just ate.
2015-07-30T12:20:32 <Bosmon> "Features: Includes a BUTTON to reclaim your disk space!"
2015-07-30T12:21:03 <the-t-in-rtf> You should really read Charles Stross Laundry Files series
2015-07-30T12:21:21 <the-t-in-rtf> magic is software that can run on brains as well as computers.
