2015-08-13T11:13:23 <the-t-in-rtf> While I'm waiting for @bosmon, I figured I'd asked the room if anyone has any experience creating dynamic component.
2015-08-13T11:13:59 <the-t-in-rtf> I have one that is created based on an event, if I pass a list of grades when firing the event, I can't refer to them in the gradeNames of the dynamic component
2015-08-13T11:14:08 <the-t-in-rtf> Example coming...
2015-08-13T11:14:27 <the-t-in-rtf> http://pastie.org/10348224
2015-08-13T11:15:17 <the-t-in-rtf> I can only get it working by creating a dynamic component that stores the list of grades in one of its options, and then having that create a dynamic subcomponent when it's created.
2015-08-13T11:16:13 <the-t-in-rtf> If you look at my first example, I can use {arguments} notation for options, but not for grades.
2015-08-13T11:16:34 <the-t-in-rtf> It complains about not being able to resolve the reference.
2015-08-13T11:17:39 <the-t-in-rtf> If anyone can think of a better way to work around this, I would be happy to hear it.
2015-08-13T11:42:58 <the-t-in-rtf> Antranig commented to me, apparently I could have just made a plain old component rather than nesting dynamic components.
2015-08-13T11:43:15 <the-t-in-rtf> Also, upgrading to the newest infusion avoids this problem:  https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5742
