2015-12-18T19:01:36 <colinclark> michelled: I was briefly burbling to Bosmon about package.json-metadata-driven builds of Infusion today
2015-12-18T19:02:05 <colinclark> and how maybe we didn\'t ever want to "trigger builds" but simply have it all automatically happen via "npm install" and "npm publish"
2015-12-18T19:02:15 <colinclark> and he sort of argued that this might not be realistic
2015-12-18T19:02:30 <colinclark> and we briefly talked about browserify, which I know you guys chatted about

2015-12-18T15:59:08 <cindyli1> hi Bosmon
2015-12-18T15:59:27 <Bosmon> Hi cindyli1
2015-12-18T16:00:34 <cindyli1> Bosmon: i have a unit test that runs fine on its own but throws this error when running in all-tests.html:
2015-12-18T16:00:34 <cindyli1> Expected at least one assertion, but none were run - call expect(0) to accept zero assertions.
2015-12-18T16:00:34 <cindyli1> Source:
2015-12-18T16:00:34 <cindyli1> QUnit.asyncTest@http://localhost/gpii/node_modules/universal/node_modules/infusion/tests/lib/qunit/js/qunit.js:401:3
2015-12-18T16:01:15 <cindyli1> looking into the iframe where the test runs, all tests passed but seems the result doesn\'t get reported back
2015-12-18T16:01:47 <cindyli1> i\'ve sort of narrow down the problem to a certain scope but don\'t understand why it happens
2015-12-18T16:01:50 <Bosmon> cindyli1 - probably it tries to run some fixtures after it is destroyed, or some similar kind of timing problem
2015-12-18T16:02:07 <cindyli1> doesn\'t seem like. let me dig out the code
2015-12-18T16:02:18 <cindyli1> i\'ve gotten rid of all timing stuff from the test
2015-12-18T16:02:57 <cindyli1> Bosmon: the test - https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/GPII-1245-odd/gpii/node_modules/gpii-oauth2/gpii-oauth2-authz-server/webTests/components/privacySettings/js/PrivacySettingsWithPrefsTests.js
2015-12-18T16:03:46 <cindyli1> line 56-58 runs a straight jqUnit test, it passes all-tests.html having no problem
2015-12-18T16:04:08 <cindyli1> but once i use line 60-62, error is thrown
2015-12-18T16:05:56 <cindyli1> i\'m now guessing probably something wrong with what\'s in the main container ".gpiic-oauth2-privacySettings"
2015-12-18T16:08:41 <cindyli1> no, not the container issue. i\'ve simplified the container to <div class="gpiic-oauth2-privacySettings"></div>, doesn\'t make difference
2015-12-18T16:11:06 <cindyli1> Bosmon: found the problem, seems caused by this line - https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/GPII-1245-odd/gpii/node_modules/gpii-oauth2/gpii-oauth2-authz-server/webTests/components/privacySettings/js/PrivacySettingsWithPrefsTests.js#L47
2015-12-18T16:12:44 <cindyli1> changing to this would work:
2015-12-18T16:12:45 <cindyli1> tests: [{
2015-12-18T16:12:45 <cindyli1> expect: 1,
2015-12-18T16:12:45 <cindyli1> name: "Component expander based on schema",
2015-12-18T16:12:45 <cindyli1> type: "test",
2015-12-18T16:12:45 <cindyli1> func: "jqUnit.assertTrue",
2015-12-18T16:12:45 <cindyli1> args: ["true", true]
2015-12-18T16:12:46 <cindyli1> }]
2015-12-18T16:14:29 <Bosmon> cindyli1 - that\'s interesting
2015-12-18T16:14:30 <cindyli1> the trick is the "name" is a must-have
2015-12-18T16:14:37 <Bosmon> AH
2015-12-18T16:14:40 * Jess_ joined the channel
2015-12-18T16:14:41 <Bosmon> That is VERY interesting
2015-12-18T16:14:46 <Bosmon> !!
2015-12-18T16:15:00 <Bosmon> I had noticed this kind of "module leakage"
2015-12-18T16:15:03 <Bosmon> But this is a great clue
2015-12-18T16:15:27 <Bosmon> It\'s also possible that there is a bug with respect to single-element sequences
2015-12-18T16:15:40 <Bosmon> cindyli1 - could you also check in your previously failing configuration into a branch?
2015-12-18T16:15:42 <colinclark> cindyli1: you\'re on vacation next week, right?
2015-12-18T16:15:47 <Bosmon> And also write up a JIRA explaining what you observed
2015-12-18T16:15:55 <cindyli1> for both issues?
2015-12-18T16:15:56 <cindyli1> sure
2015-12-18T16:15:58 <cindyli1> i can do that
2015-12-18T16:16:01 <Bosmon> cindyli1 - yesterday\'s and today\'s yes
2015-12-18T16:16:10 <cindyli1> i will be on till around 2 this afternoon
2015-12-18T16:16:29 <cindyli1> then see you next year ;)
2015-12-18T16:16:32 <Bosmon> Yesterday\'s issue relating to apparent notification of model relay after component destruction, and your initial failed attempt to guard it with fluid.isDestroyed()
2015-12-18T16:16:43 <cindyli1> sure
2015-12-18T16:16:54 <Bosmon> And then today\'s issue relating to apparent leakage of test fixtures with respect to the iframe test runner
2015-12-18T16:16:58 <Bosmon> Awesome
2015-12-18T16:17:07 <cindyli1> sure. i have 2 branches for that anyway
2015-12-18T16:17:19 <colinclark> I was thinking, cindyli1 and Bosmon and michelled, that we should schedule a meeting early in the new year to check in with Kasper and Javi (and Simon) to calibrate our security work against what they\'re planning to demonstrate at the review.
2015-12-18T16:17:30 <colinclark> Amazingly, it will be 10 days after we all get back from our holiday
2015-12-18T16:17:42 <colinclark> Does that seem like a good idea?
2015-12-18T16:17:49 <Bosmon> What on earth
2015-12-18T16:17:53 <cindyli1> certainly
2015-12-18T16:17:53 <Bosmon> The review is Jan 14th?
2015-12-18T16:17:56 <colinclark> I believe so, yes
2015-12-18T16:18:00 <colinclark> let me double check
2015-12-18T16:18:17 <colinclark> Appears to be January 14-15, yes
2015-12-18T16:18:30 <colinclark> Simon and I will be calling in remotely
2015-12-18T16:18:38 <michelled> colinclark: Kasper said that he tried out the security demo and was happy with it for the review
2015-12-18T16:18:41 <colinclark> and I think Kasper or Javi will do the actual demo of your stuff, cindyli1
2015-12-18T16:18:50 <cindyli1> cool
2015-12-18T16:18:52 <colinclark> So where does that leave the work cindyli1 is currenty working on, michelled?
2015-12-18T16:18:55 <colinclark> Will it not be demoed?
2015-12-18T16:19:03 <colinclark> or was it part of what Kasper tried out?
2015-12-18T16:19:14 <cindyli1> yes, kasper has tried out. it worked
2015-12-18T16:19:15 <michelled> I think cindyli is working on tests for the stuff that will be demoed
2015-12-18T16:19:19 <colinclark> ok
2015-12-18T16:19:20 <colinclark> great
2015-12-18T16:19:25 <michelled> for the purpose of getting it to master
2015-12-18T16:19:34 <colinclark> getting it into master will be fun, cindyli1
2015-12-18T16:19:37 <colinclark> "fun"
2015-12-18T16:19:38 <cindyli1> the tests stuff is not necessary for the demo. but necessary for the entire branch to get into the master
2015-12-18T16:19:43 <colinclark> ok
2015-12-18T16:19:43 <cindyli1> rught
2015-12-18T16:19:48 <cindyli1> iright
2015-12-18T16:19:50 <cindyli1> right
2015-12-18T16:19:52 <cindyli1> i cannot type
2015-12-18T16:19:52 <colinclark> hahaha
2015-12-18T16:20:02 <colinclark> So are you working against Bosmon amazing (and terrifying) new branch?
2015-12-18T16:20:10 <colinclark> or still against review4?
2015-12-18T16:20:15 <cindyli1> no, that\'s something i need to check with kasper
2015-12-18T16:20:31 <cindyli1> this branch is not using Bosmon\'s new branch yet
2015-12-18T16:20:35 <colinclark> where is the Great KASPARNET these days?
2015-12-18T16:21:21 <cindyli1> same ask ;)
2015-12-18T16:22:15 <michelled> I think it\'s unlikely that the new branch would be used
2015-12-18T16:22:23 <michelled> unless someone else has a requirement on it for their demos
2015-12-18T16:22:31 <michelled> it\'s very close to the review at this point
2015-12-18T16:22:50 <colinclark> yes
2015-12-18T16:23:02 <colinclark> Kasper told me clearly that he won\'t merge Bosmon\'s big new branch into review4
2015-12-18T16:23:10 <colinclark> Which I think is prudent, though inconvenient
2015-12-18T16:23:15 <michelled> ok, good to know
2015-12-18T16:23:36 <colinclark> my question was more, if cindyli1\'s working on tests to help get her security work into master, should she also work on updating to Bosmon\'s new branch?
2015-12-18T16:23:41 <colinclark> My inclination is to say yes
2015-12-18T16:23:46 <colinclark> This is, of course, all in the new year :)
2015-12-18T16:23:55 <cindyli1> would love to do that
2015-12-18T16:24:04 <cindyli1> still learning the new infusion
2015-12-18T16:25:09 <michelled> I think that would mean that we won\'t be able to show anything new for sonification in Feb. which is ok - we can show our progress on the dashboards
2015-12-18T16:25:12 <alanharnum> while we\'re on this topic, could I ask if anyone has successfully had an oauth2 setup running with the flow manager using cloudBased.production or a similar config that expects a separate preferences server with couchdb backend?
2015-12-18T16:28:30 <colinclark> alanharnum: I suspect you might be right in the middle of a bit of an experience gap, too
2015-12-18T16:28:40 <colinclark> Simon, of course, could have answered the question
2015-12-18T16:28:54 <alanharnum> i\'m trying to track out why everything works as expected when running First Discovery Server connecting to a flow manager with the cloudBased.development.all.local configuration, but breaks down when using the cloudBased.production configuration; I think I\'ve narrowed it down to flow manager throwing an error when trying to actually save the preferences set, which I thought pointed to an integration issue in my setup w
2015-12-18T16:28:55 <alanharnum> ith the separate preferences server, but as far as I can tell the flow manager never even attempts to contact the preferences server
2015-12-18T16:29:09 <alanharnum> colinclark: yeah :( c\'est la vie
2015-12-18T16:29:33 <colinclark> alanharnum: Do you have an example of what your config looks like? And an example of the error?
2015-12-18T16:30:15 <alanharnum> I\'m using the default configs - in looking closer I saw that cloudBased.production layered in what it needed (the oauth2 sample data I was asking about yesterday) from cloudBased.development.all.local
2015-12-18T16:31:06 <alanharnum> i\'ll get the error after standup - at this point I\'ve actually been calling Flow Manager directly (via Postman) to take First Discovery Server out of the mix
2015-12-18T16:32:38 * alanharnum has quit
2015-12-18T16:42:01 * anastasiac has quit
2015-12-18T16:45:54 * anastasiac joined the channel
2015-12-18T16:46:00 * alanharnum joined the channel
2015-12-18T16:49:13 <alanharnum> colinclark: the error is this one when trying to call the /add-preferences?view=flat endpoint via Postman (or a running First Discovery server that hits the same endpoint) when in the cloudbased.production configuration: http://pastie.org/private/tyd7q3kudazi2khawyzsnw
2015-12-18T16:49:35 <alanharnum> I\'ve already gotten an authentication token successfully via the /access_token endpoint
2015-12-18T16:50:21 <alanharnum> have confirmed that calling things this way works if running flow manager in the cloudBased.development.all.local configuration
2015-12-18T16:50:50 <alanharnum> have also confirmed that the separate preferences server responds as expected to calls to save preferences
2015-12-18T16:51:38 <alanharnum> as far as I can tell, the flow manager never tries to reach the preferences server with a malformed request, etc (errors are all in the running Flow Manager, no errors in the running Preferences Server or indication something has tried to make a request to it)
2015-12-18T16:52:48 <alanharnum> I am wondering if these lines might not be the culprit: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/configs/cloudBased.development.all.local.json#L40-L42
2015-12-18T16:55:56 <alanharnum> if there\'s a dependency on a separate config line to actually make the post of the preferences, that would explain what i\'m seeing
2015-12-18T16:56:04 <alanharnum> maybe
2015-12-18T17:07:37 <alanharnum> ok, that appears to have been it
2015-12-18T17:15:10 <alanharnum> so along with configuring cloudBasedUrls, need to configure authServerUrls.preferencesPost
2015-12-18T17:21:16 <alanharnum> Interesting - IBM team has used http://electron.atom.io/ to wrap the First Discovery Tool as a textbook app
2015-12-18T17:21:27 <alanharnum> hadn\'t heard of Electron, it\'s underlying the Atom editor though
2015-12-18T17:22:55 <colinclark> Yes, I suggested Electron to them last week
2015-12-18T17:23:07 <colinclark> it\'s quite cool
2015-12-18T17:23:46 <alanharnum> textbook app = desktop app

2015-12-18T17:31:11 <colinclark> yes
2015-12-18T17:31:22 <colinclark> the open version of it maintained by Apache, alanharnum
2015-12-18T17:31:25 <colinclark> called Cordova
