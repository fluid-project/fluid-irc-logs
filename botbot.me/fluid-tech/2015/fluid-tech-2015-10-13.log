2015-10-13T15:39:58 <the-t-in-rtf> Has anyone encountered situations where a testCaseHolder\'s components are destroyed before the test is complete?
2015-10-13T15:40:14 <the-t-in-rtf> I am seeing lots of "cannot resolve path into component which has been destroyed" messages in my tests.
2015-10-13T15:40:44 <the-t-in-rtf> The component itself has no timeouts or mechanisms that should result in destruction.
2015-10-13T15:43:42 <the-t-in-rtf> Never mind, I figured out which call was resulting in the destruction by looking at recent changes.

2015-10-13T18:40:08 <the-t-in-rtf> My own recent changes.
2015-10-13T18:40:52 <the-t-in-rtf> @bosmon, apparently the component dies when a stream is closed in one of the library components.  It was part of the pull request to modernize the mail testing framework.
2015-10-13T18:41:29 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - why does it die when the stream is closed?

2015-10-13T19:43:47 <the-t-in-rtf> @bosmon, Not sure yet, but if I both pipe the stream that contains the mail message and then execute the callback that\'s supplied, the component is destroyed.   If you have a half hour tomorrow afternoon I would be happy to demonstrate and talk it throuhg.
2015-10-13T19:43:52 <the-t-in-rtf> I could use help troubleshooting it.
2015-10-13T20:05:01 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf: The component is almost certainly destroyed because your test fixture is finished
2015-10-13T20:05:12 <Bosmon> Calling the callback that\'s supplied no doubt executes your final test fixture
2015-10-13T20:05:21 <Bosmon> Which is the signal to the system that you are done with the component tree

2015-10-13T20:58:01 <the-t-in-rtf> If I don\'t call the callback the mail server never finishes communicating with the client.
2015-10-13T20:58:45 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, I had thought that callback was coming from the library, it certainly was not an invoker or anything fluidish.
