2015-11-09T15:33:35 <the-t-in-rtf> What\'s the new way of requiring fluid promises (i.e. without using a path to node_modules)?
2015-11-09T15:33:46 <the-t-in-rtf> Is it now included by default?
2015-11-09T15:33:51 <the-t-in-rtf> @bosmon @colinclark
2015-11-09T15:34:10 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - not sure what you mean by "new way"
2015-11-09T15:34:16 <Bosmon> Can you give me an example of what you consider the old way?
2015-11-09T15:36:56 <Bosmon> If you\'re speaking of the node.js packaging, this was always included by default
2015-11-09T15:37:56 <the-t-in-rtf> OK, I think I got a warning about not having it somewhere along the line.  It turns out what I have ran without it.
2015-11-09T15:38:01 <the-t-in-rtf> So ignore that\xe2\x80\xa6 :P
2015-11-09T15:38:15 <the-t-in-rtf> That question was so three minutes ago.
2015-11-09T15:38:58 <the-t-in-rtf> but thanks!
