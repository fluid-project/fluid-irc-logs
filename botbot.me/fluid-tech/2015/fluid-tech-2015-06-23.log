2015-06-23T12:53:17 <the-t-in-rtf> @bosmon (or anyone), is there a way to fire multiple changes at once using fireChangeRequest?
2015-06-23T12:56:21 <the-t-in-rtf> I have a case in which I know about a set of changes, I am worried about generating multiple refreshes and other events if I apply each change separately.
2015-06-23T12:58:58 <Bosmon> hi the-t-in-rtf - yes, you can use transactions
2015-06-23T12:59:51 <the-t-in-rtf> Ah, I saw that part of the docs.
2015-06-23T12:59:54 <the-t-in-rtf> I will reread it.
2015-06-23T13:03:55 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - hopefully this example is clear enough - http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/ChangeApplierAPI.html#operating-transactions-manually
2015-06-23T13:04:08 <the-t-in-rtf> Yes.
2015-06-23T13:04:09 <Bosmon> The API is currently a bit awkward - there will be a more declarative scheme before long
2015-06-23T13:04:20 <the-t-in-rtf> I have been studying that at length for the last hour or so while working.
2015-06-23T13:04:49 <the-t-in-rtf> I tried to intuit a new syntax based on the change received by model listeners in the new world\xe2\x80\xa6. ;)
2015-06-23T13:05:10 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, testing now.
2015-06-23T13:12:59 * maozillah joined the channel
2015-06-23T13:13:19 <the-t-in-rtf> It doesn\'t seem to work, let me make some coffee just in case.
2015-06-23T13:22:25 <Bosmon> What do you mean by "doesn\'t seem to work"
2015-06-23T13:25:21 <the-t-in-rtf> No changes are applied.
2015-06-23T13:25:51 <the-t-in-rtf> It is most likely my fault as usual.  Sipping coffee and stepping through it.
2015-06-23T13:26:57 <the-t-in-rtf> I am working on a linkage between the model, the location bar, and the browser history.  I know you are passionate about bookmarkable states and the back button.  This will greatly improve support for both.
2015-06-23T13:28:59 <the-t-in-rtf> OK, @bosmon, is "requestSpec" in the docs different from the { path: "path", value: "value" } syntax?
2015-06-23T13:30:00 <the-t-in-rtf> That is the only bit different from the documentation.

2015-06-23T13:37:57 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - did you remember to call "commit" on the transaction?
2015-06-23T13:37:57 <the-t-in-rtf> I found a problem in my transform rules, I will continue with it a bit later and share when I have something worth looking at.
2015-06-23T13:38:02 <the-t-in-rtf> yes, definitely
2015-06-23T13:38:04 <Bosmon> ok cool
2015-06-23T13:38:19 <the-t-in-rtf> I just transformed the data into an object that is nested improperly
2015-06-23T13:38:27 <the-t-in-rtf> so the paths can never match\xe2\x80\xa6 :|
2015-06-23T13:38:46 <the-t-in-rtf> Should be easy to fix.

2015-06-23T14:48:31 <the-t-in-rtf> @bosmon, the paths were off because of my interpretation of this line in the docs:  var myApplier = fluid.makeChangeApplier(myModel);
2015-06-23T14:48:40 <the-t-in-rtf> I took that to mean that I should pass that.model
2015-06-23T14:48:49 <the-t-in-rtf> when in fact it expects to work with something that holds a model.
2015-06-23T14:48:52 <Bosmon> urg
2015-06-23T14:49:03 <Bosmon> In fact you must not create your own applier - the docs are only indicative
2015-06-23T14:49:07 <Bosmon> You must use the one that is there already
2015-06-23T14:49:24 <the-t-in-rtf> Oh, great, even simpler.
2015-06-23T14:50:06 <the-t-in-rtf> The docs need to stop being indicative in this manner, then.
2015-06-23T14:50:16 <the-t-in-rtf> But I am happy to take out the line.
2015-06-23T14:50:27 <Bosmon> ok
2015-06-23T14:50:47 <the-t-in-rtf> But wait.
2015-06-23T14:51:36 <the-t-in-rtf> If I use the existing applier, how does it know not to just apply the change immediately?
2015-06-23T14:51:52 <the-t-in-rtf> since I am using the applier\'s fireChangeRequest
2015-06-23T14:52:08 <Bosmon> The rest of the docs should be used as is
2015-06-23T14:52:21 <Bosmon> In that you are not using the applier\'s fireChangeRequest, but the transaction\'s
