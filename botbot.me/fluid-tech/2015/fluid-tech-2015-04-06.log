2015-04-06T15:19:47 <ashgotti> Good morning everyone. I need a bit of help with translations. We have a client who needs bilingual options. I have htem all translated except for two things: the on/off toggle and the TOC header. I see that the TOC header should be translatable here: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/573/files but I don't know where it's set.
2015-04-06T15:21:06 <ashgotti> I'm using the .json files in the messages folder to do my translations but don't know how to do those two remaining strings
