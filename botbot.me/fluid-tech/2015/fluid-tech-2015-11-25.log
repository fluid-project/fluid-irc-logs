2015-11-25T13:57:30 <the-t-in-rtf1> @bosmon, I hope you recall our "binder" that binds selectors to model values.
2015-11-25T13:57:56 <the-t-in-rtf1> I am looking at it again, it fails completely if the selector isn\'t valid.
2015-11-25T13:58:12 <the-t-in-rtf1> if you recall, that.locate() with a bad selector returns the container.
2015-11-25T13:58:16 <the-t-in-rtf1> rather than null.
2015-11-25T13:58:50 <the-t-in-rtf1> I am wrapping the result in fluid.unwrap, which is undefined for selectors that don\'t exist and defined for selectors that are.
2015-11-25T13:59:19 <the-t-in-rtf1> Is using fluid.unwrap a reasonable way to detect this?
2015-11-25T13:59:39 <the-t-in-rtf1> in other words var element = that.locate(selector)
2015-11-25T13:59:46 <the-t-in-rtf1> and then if (fluid.unwrap(element))
2015-11-25T13:59:55 <the-t-in-rtf1> as a test for validity.

2015-11-25T14:35:42 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf1 - you may instead just want to patch the DOM binder
2015-11-25T14:35:59 <Bosmon> The correct behaviour for it should be to return a 0-element jQuery in the case the selector matches nothing
2015-11-25T14:36:23 <Bosmon> We can patch this in a shortly upcoming infusion, this behaviour has annoyed us for far too long
2015-11-25T14:39:17 <the-t-in-rtf1> I would be very gratified to have that be my first pull request against infusion.
2015-11-25T14:47:50 <the-t-in-rtf1> I would start with the tests, but just to confirm that I\'m on the right track, I would need to change behavior round about here:  https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/core/js/FluidView.js#L170

2015-11-25T19:25:40 <cindyli> Justin_o: in ur doc for the first discovery server, there\'s a table that explains configuration variables. the last column is named "Example" but those values look like default values. if so, shall that column be named "default values"? Also, some variable values are not changeable, such as "grant_type" and "scope", we probably should add notes of "This value must be set to \xe2\x80\xa6"
2015-11-25T19:25:52 <cindyli> let me know what you think
2015-11-25T19:27:15 <Justin_o> cindyli: so they are in fact intended to be examples and not defaults, as we don\'t really have a default client_id for example. And theoretically the security/preferences server it connects to could use a different means of connection
2015-11-25T19:27:32 <Justin_o> although i guess there are some assumptions about it at least following the two request model
2015-11-25T19:28:42 <cindyli> Justin_o: the first discovery tool is only implemented to use the "client_credential" API
2015-11-25T19:29:14 <cindyli> and for adding preferences, not others
2015-11-25T19:29:40 <Justin_o> cindyli: but those are things defined by the security server, if we were to connect to a different one, those options might change
2015-11-25T19:29:46 <Justin_o> even if we are just creating a preference set
2015-11-25T19:29:53 <Justin_o> at least that\'s my understanding
2015-11-25T19:32:04 <cindyli> Justin_o: if that part is changed, the whole implementation of the first discovery tool needs to be changed accordingly, for example the end point provided and the code behind it

2015-11-25T21:10:02 <Justin_o> cindyli:  i don\'t think it would need to change so drastically. I\'m thinking if someone else were to implement a preference server with an Oauth2 security layer on top that they might call the scope just "add" or the grant type "clientCredentials" or something like that
2015-11-25T21:10:46 <Justin_o> cindyli: would it help if i added a link to your documentation for the Oauth2 security that this is using
2015-11-25T21:11:02 <Justin_o> at least that way the integrator would know what configuration will most likely be used
