2015-08-07T11:32:31 <kasparnet> I\'m sitting with the PCP code - trying to do the real-time framework part of things
2015-08-07T11:33:10 <kasparnet> and I want to make the system pass the feedback from the user login to the PCP
2015-08-07T11:33:32 <kasparnet> but am running into some annoying issue
2015-08-07T11:34:39 <kasparnet> so in my tests, I have a "loginRequest" (from the regular GPII testframework)
2015-08-07T11:35:06 <kasparnet> so a snapshot of my sequence is this:
2015-08-07T11:35:12 <kasparnet> func: "{loginRequest}.send"
2015-08-07T11:35:12 <kasparnet> }, {
2015-08-07T11:35:12 <kasparnet> event: "{loginRequest}.events.onComplete",
2015-08-07T11:35:14 <kasparnet> listener: "gpii.tests.integration.PCPInterface.checkLoginResponse"
2015-08-07T11:35:25 <kasparnet> which is fine, and works as expected
2015-08-07T11:36:08 <kasparnet> but now I want to add a listener to the request, inside the UserLogin.js file, to catch the "onComplete" event and pass the output to the PCP
2015-08-07T11:36:14 <kasparnet> so in UserLogin, I have:
2015-08-07T11:36:55 <kasparnet> I have added a new listener:             onComplete: "{that}.tester"
2015-08-07T11:37:09 <kasparnet> and of course a \'tester\' invoker, a corresponding function, etc
2015-08-07T11:37:27 <kasparnet> but as soon as I add that the tests stalls
2015-08-07T11:37:52 <kasparnet> it seems neither my listener in UserLogin.js nor the one in the test is being triggered
2015-08-07T11:38:16 <kasparnet> I\'ll play around with it some more - but was wondering if you see some obvious stupidity in what I\'m doing?
2015-08-07T12:06:19 <kasparnet> Bosmon: ok did some debugging, and I can see now that the UserLogin component doesn\'t even have an onComplete :)
2015-08-07T12:12:19 <kasparnet> ok - requestProxy is the thing to listen to :)
