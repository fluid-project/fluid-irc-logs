2015-11-04T16:07:05 <colinclark> alanharnum: https://github.com/colinbdclark/bergson/blob/master/src/js/scheduler.js#L80
2015-11-04T16:07:26 <alanharnum> colinclark: yeah
2015-11-04T16:07:32 <colinclark> Just adjust that model property
2015-11-04T16:07:36 <colinclark> and you\'ve got your zoom factor
2015-11-04T16:07:56 <alanharnum> colinclark: I think if I understood making sound with computers more than i do it would be pretty easy to prototype this
2015-11-04T16:08:09 <colinclark> yeah
2015-11-04T16:08:18 <alanharnum> colinclark: what i love the idea of (ultimately) is students / end users being able to share their strategies with each other
2015-11-04T16:08:19 <colinclark> let\'s sit down this week and try to prototype it together
2015-11-04T16:08:53 <alanharnum> something like a simple declarative config for "my preferred sonification strategy for <x> type of data"
