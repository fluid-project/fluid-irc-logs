2015-05-28T20:26:26 <anastasiac> simonjb: the kbd-a11y plugin has a \xe2\x80\x9ccurrentSelection\xe2\x80\x9d method that you can pass a value; it will set the current selection to that target. You could use that on initialization to set the current selection?
2015-05-28T20:26:50 <simonjb> anastasiac: I believe that it also sets focus
2015-05-28T20:27:39 <anastasiac> hm. did you try it?
2015-05-28T20:27:45 <anastasiac> simonjb: ^
2015-05-28T20:28:27 <simonjb> anastasiac: no but, I defintely can
2015-05-28T20:29:18 <anastasiac> simonjb, the code doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look like it will focus...
2015-05-28T20:29:27 <simonjb> fluid.selectable.currentSelection: "Returns the currently selected item wrapped as a jQuery object."
2015-05-28T20:29:39 <simonjb> doesn\'t look like it sets anything
2015-05-28T20:30:23 <simonjb> I was thinking of fluid.selectable.select which does focus
2015-05-28T20:30:25 <anastasiac> the code looks like it does, simonjb
2015-05-28T20:32:06 <simonjb> anastasiac: can you send a link?, the func I\'m looking at only returns
2015-05-28T20:34:01 <simonjb> anastasiac: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/core/js/jquery.keyboard-a11y.js#L506-L510
2015-05-28T20:34:11 <simonjb> are you looking at something else?
2015-05-28T20:34:21 <anastasiac> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/core/js/jquery.keyboard-a11y.js#L506-L510
2015-05-28T20:34:25 <anastasiac> ah, great minds...
2015-05-28T20:34:36 <anastasiac> you\xe2\x80\x99ll see that it accepts \xe2\x80\x9ctarget"
2015-05-28T20:34:53 <anastasiac> and it calls selectedElement() on it
2015-05-28T20:35:16 <anastasiac> ah, hm
2015-05-28T20:35:28 <anastasiac> ok, maybe not
2015-05-28T20:35:34 <anastasiac> ok, simonjb I guess I\xe2\x80\x99m wrong
2015-05-28T20:36:37 <anastasiac> frankly, there should be a way to set the current selection programmatically...
2015-05-28T20:36:42 <simonjb> anastasiac: it should absolutely be possible, and if there currently isn\'t a way to set the selected item from outside, then we can add one
