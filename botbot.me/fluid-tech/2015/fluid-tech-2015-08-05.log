2015-08-05T14:05:34 <Bosmon> kasparnet - I\'ve pushed a version of your GPII-641 branch up that seems to work ok: https://github.com/amb26/universal/tree/GPII-641
2015-08-05T14:05:48 <Bosmon> And I\'ve also issued a "quick fix" branch for KETTLE-33 that goes with it
2015-08-05T14:06:03 <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/pull/20
2015-08-05T14:08:39 <kasparnet> Awesome! Cheers Bosmon!!!!
2015-08-05T14:09:13 <Bosmon> In general, everyone should note - the behaviour of a node VM after an uncaught exception has been propagated can\'t be depended on
2015-08-05T14:09:42 <Bosmon> All kinds of appalling rubbish can happen after this, including events failing to tick, and finally blocks failing to execute
2015-08-05T14:10:23 <Bosmon> So we should make sure to use fluid.fail only for conditions that would represent an "assertion failure" rather than one that could result from user error
2015-08-05T14:10:47 <Bosmon> If you expect the VM to keep running after a problem, you should fire request.error instead (in Kettle terms)
2015-08-05T14:11:35 <Bosmon> We\'ll be revising these semantics in the future, since really we can\'t ever risk having a VM become corrupt if we can possibly avoid it - but these are the ones in current Infusion and Kettle trunks as well as in the upcoming ones
2015-08-05T14:12:03 <the-t-in-rtf1> OK, we will have to keep an eye out for similar patterns in subsequent reviews of gpii.express.
2015-08-05T14:12:19 <the-t-in-rtf1> You convinced me to convert many things to use fluid.fail, hopefully all are safe.
2015-08-05T14:13:02 <Bosmon> We should go over them again... this is an issue that keeps falling out of my consciousness from time to time
2015-08-05T14:13:20 * simonjb joined the channel
2015-08-05T14:13:52 <Bosmon> But I don\'t think you yet have anything which depends on the "uncaught exception" semantic, it would be a red flag if you did
2015-08-05T14:14:16 <Bosmon> But I need to keep reminding myself that this really is a kind of "last ditch" node semantic rather than anything which should ever be depended on

2015-08-05T14:45:37 <Bosmon> sgithens, the-t-in-rtf1 - sadly you have misspelled the repo name
2015-08-05T14:45:42 * Jess_ has quit
2015-08-05T14:45:56 <Bosmon> It reads LUCUNE rather than LUCENE
2015-08-05T14:46:20 <the-t-in-rtf1> yes.
2015-08-05T14:46:27 <the-t-in-rtf1> I just pointed that out privately to save the shame.
2015-08-05T14:46:33 <the-t-in-rtf1> although "lucune" is very nice sounding
2015-08-05T14:46:56 <the-t-in-rtf1> "lucune" and "nepenthe" would make great sisters in a period drama
2015-08-05T14:47:20 <Bosmon> http://pbfcomics.com/60/
2015-08-05T14:47:26 <Bosmon> This legendary comic comes to mind :)

2015-08-05T15:04:40 <the-t-in-rtf1> @bosmon, can you assign this to yourself?  https://github.com/GPII/gpii-pouchdb-lucene/pull/1
2015-08-05T15:04:53 <the-t-in-rtf1> I can\'t assign pull request reviews for the new repo.

2015-08-05T15:07:34 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf1 - done
2015-08-05T15:07:38 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf1 - about https://github.com/GPII/gpii-handlebars/pull/9/files
2015-08-05T15:08:05 <Bosmon> is it included by https://github.com/GPII/gpii-handlebars/pull/10 ?

2015-08-05T15:10:32 <the-t-in-rtf1> It appears so.
2015-08-05T15:11:02 <the-t-in-rtf1> This is one of the reasons I wanted to close these out, the commit history is getting pretty hairy.
2015-08-05T15:13:39 <the-t-in-rtf1> I saw your comment regarding postinstall, I ended up using that with the pouchdb-lucene package as well.
2015-08-05T15:14:17 <the-t-in-rtf1> that = that hook
2015-08-05T15:14:20 <the-t-in-rtf1> not that specific use.
