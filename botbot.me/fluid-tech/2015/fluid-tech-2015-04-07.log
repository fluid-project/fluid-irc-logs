2015-04-07T12:36:31 <ashopin> Good morning everyone. I need a bit of help with translations. We have a client who needs bilingual options. I have htem all translated except for two things: the on/off toggle and the TOC header. I see that the TOC header should be translatable here: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/pull/573/files but I don't know where it's set.
2015-04-07T12:36:39 <ashopin> I'm using the .json files in the messages folder to do my translations but don't know how to do those two remaining strings

2015-04-07T14:51:08 <Bosmon> Hi Justin_o - I wonder if you know the answer to ashopin's question about translating the TOC header?
2015-04-07T14:51:33 <Justin_o> Bosmon: where is the question?
2015-04-07T14:51:43 <ashopin> Here:
2015-04-07T14:51:44 <ashopin> Good morning everyone. I need a bit of help with translations. We have a client who needs bilingual options. I have htem all translated except for two things: the on/off toggle and the TOC header.

2015-04-07T14:51:44 <ashopin> I'm using the .json files in the messages folder to do my translations but don't know how to do those two remaining strings

2015-04-07T14:51:48 <Bosmon> I think you just missed it in the channel both times
2015-04-07T14:52:17 <ashopin> @Bosmon: thanks for the help :)

2015-04-07T15:03:50 <Justin_o> Bosmon, ashopin: sorry if i keep missing things. I think there is still an outstanding issue though http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5568
2015-04-07T15:05:13 <ashopin> Justin_o: ah ok, thanks. Didn't see this.
2015-04-07T15:05:47 <Justin_o> sorry, right now the message bundles only get sent down to the panels.
2015-04-07T15:07:10 <ashopin> Is there any way that I can build translations?
2015-04-07T15:07:22 <cindyli> ashopin: if you are using schema version of the prefs framework, as Justin_o's said, the message bundles can only be sent down to panels. but if you are using the grade version of the prefs framework, you can send down messages to enhancer by using component options
2015-04-07T15:08:28 <Justin_o> ashopin: how are you managing the languages?
2015-04-07T15:08:41 <ashopin> cindyli: thank you for the info. I don't really follow though. I'm creating a Drupal module to integrate uiPreferences and making sure it has full multlilingual support. What I've done is create a /messages folder in the module folder where users can create translation sets in language folders like /en, /fr, and in the .JS I use to enact the languages, they can define the different languages
2015-04-07T15:08:57 <ashopin> https://www.drupal.org/sandbox/ashopin/2385899
2015-04-07T15:10:01 <Justin_o> ashopin: how do you set the language used
2015-04-07T15:10:49 <ashopin> Justin_o: simple JS http://cgit.drupalcode.org/sandbox-ashopin-2385899/tree/js/load.js?h=7.x-1.x you can set up conditions that if the base_url = url/en, use one set
2015-04-07T15:14:34 <Justin_o> ashopin: so it will be possible, but not exactly easy... you'd need to override the strings block from the ToC component, instead of working with messageBundles for this one. https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/components/tableOfContents/js/TableOfContents.js#L111-L113
2015-04-07T15:16:04 <ashopin> Justin_o: So in my load.js, override the TOC string?
2015-04-07T15:16:33 <ashopin> and what about the on/off toggle strings?
2015-04-07T15:16:40 <Justin_o> yes, that would be one option.. but you'd have to load in the string yourself, and send it down to the ToC compoent
2015-04-07T15:17:47 <ashopin> ok thanks, I'll give it a try and see what I can do. I may have misread the issue you posted earlier but is there a solution in the works?
2015-04-07T15:18:24 <cindyli> infusion/examples/framework/preferences/shared/html/incSize-template.html
2015-04-07T15:19:00 <cindyli> this is another issue we should file a jira on, Justin_o
2015-04-07T15:19:18 <cindyli> for on off toggles
2015-04-07T15:19:40 <ashopin> :) thanks
2015-04-07T15:20:04 <cindyli> good findings, ashopin
2015-04-07T15:21:24 <ashopin> Let me know if you need my help for testing. ash.ahmadzadeh@opin.ca
2015-04-07T15:21:42 <Justin_o> ashopin: there are no specific fixes in the works at the moment, although we are currently making some modifications to how the message bundles are working in the preferences framework, so we may have a chance to work on it.
2015-04-07T15:21:44 <Justin_o> ashopin: thanks
