2015-08-11T13:03:33 <Bosmon2> the-t-in-rtf1 - thanks for the updates to your pulls - could you merge in the branch in https://github.com/GPII/gpii-handlebars/pull/10 to make it up to date with the latest work pushed to https://github.com/GPII/gpii-handlebars/pull/9 and then I can merge them in - cheers!

2015-08-11T13:08:01 <the-t-in-rtf1> @bosmon, Just so I\'m clear, I would merge the branch I used to create #9 with the branch I used to create #10, after which the pull request will be in the state you want?
2015-08-11T13:08:22 <the-t-in-rtf1> requests
2015-08-11T13:08:32 <Bosmon2> the-t-in-rtf1 - yes - unless one of them is already up to date with the other.......
2015-08-11T13:08:49 <Bosmon2> But I assume that currently the two pull requests hold divergent contents
2015-08-11T13:09:05 <the-t-in-rtf1> I think one is a superset of the other, but I can confirm with a quick internal pull request and merge.
2015-08-11T13:09:23 <the-t-in-rtf1> My guess would be that 10 truly does contain everything in 9 already, but we shall soon see.
2015-08-11T13:10:12 <Bosmon2> My certain knowledge is that it does not :)
2015-08-11T13:20:25 <the-t-in-rtf1> I merged #10 with #9, that branch now contains all commits:  https://github.com/GPII/gpii-handlebars/pull/9
2015-08-11T13:20:40 <the-t-in-rtf1> https://github.com/the-t-in-rtf/gpii-handlebars/tree/GPII-1222

2015-08-11T13:29:16 <the-t-in-rtf1> I have confirmed that GPII-1179 and GPII-1180 are included in the merged branch for GPII-1222 (as is GPII-1225).  Would it be easier to go ahead and close those out?
2015-08-11T13:31:05 <the-t-in-rtf1> @bosmon
2015-08-11T13:33:03 <Bosmon2> the-t-in-rtf1 - yes, let\'s close out all the other pulls
2015-08-11T13:33:18 <Bosmon2> I\'ve reported a test failure in the meantime on https://github.com/GPII/gpii-handlebars/pull/9
2015-08-11T13:34:55 <the-t-in-rtf1> Great, I will close out the others and we can continue there.

2015-08-11T14:23:38 <the-t-in-rtf1> I am afraid the test failure is a result of Zombie not properly handling file URLs:  https://github.com/assaf/zombie/issues/915
2015-08-11T14:24:12 <the-t-in-rtf1> Their own tests fail on Windows 7 according to the report.  I am verifying now.
2015-08-11T14:35:01 <the-t-in-rtf1> In the version we use their own tests completely fail to load file content on Windows.
2015-08-11T14:36:00 <the-t-in-rtf1> I can work around the problem by hosting this test in an instance of gpii.express.  It is certainly overkill, but should not hurt anything.
2015-08-11T14:40:24 <the-t-in-rtf1> Even if they fixed it in a newer version of Zombie, we can\'t use it, as they have migrated to io.js and appear not to be compatible with anything resembling our node version.
2015-08-11T14:43:14 <the-t-in-rtf1> Zombie: it\'s dead to us, but lives on.
2015-08-11T14:44:46 <the-t-in-rtf1> Or to quote Game of Thrones, that which is dead can never die.

2015-08-11T14:53:53 <the-t-in-rtf> I will have to give Phantom another look at some point.

2015-08-11T16:48:16 <Bosmon2> Looks like this is the new deal: http://www.infoworld.com/article/2960452/javascript/unforked-iojs-v3-sets-stage-for-nodejs-merger.html
2015-08-11T16:48:23 <Bosmon2> What we will have to be ready for is "node v4"
2015-08-11T16:55:02 <Bosmon2> Hey colinclark - look at this : P  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Object_initializer#Computed_property_names
2015-08-11T16:55:12 <Bosmon2> "quoted key initialisers" have actually arisen
2015-08-11T16:55:26 <Bosmon2> Although unfortunately they\'ve caused what could be considered a regression in the ability to verify standard JSON
2015-08-11T17:05:22 <colinclark> ah yes

2015-08-11T19:09:14 <the-t-in-rtf> @bosmon, their site claims that .12 or less should only use Zombie 2.x, but I can test it when I get the chance.
2015-08-11T19:09:47 <Bosmon2> the-t-in-rtf - see above about the "new deal" on node versions
2015-08-11T19:10:00 <Bosmon2> Is there any kind of quick hack to make this test pass whilst we are waiting for "node 4" to be released?

2015-08-11T19:48:20 <the-t-in-rtf> There is indeed a hack, and I mentioned it.
2015-08-11T19:48:33 <the-t-in-rtf> All content hosted via gpii.express will continue to work cross platform.

2015-08-11T19:57:07 <the-t-in-rtf> I came online to finish the fix and test it on Windows.
2015-08-11T19:58:41 <the-t-in-rtf> Ah, I have the URL for the "new deal", I will take a look in the morning.
2015-08-11T20:08:13 <the-t-in-rtf> The VM is very\xe2\x80\xa6 gradually\xe2\x80\xa6 working\xe2\x80\xa6 on the installs I need to complete the testing.

2015-08-11T20:27:54 <cindyli> Justin_o: i made a little adjustment on the pull request https://github.com/fluid-project/first-discovery/pull/93. if you are reviewing it, pls update
