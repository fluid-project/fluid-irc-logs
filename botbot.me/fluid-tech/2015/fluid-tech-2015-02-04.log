2015-02-04T10:54:43 <the-t-in-rtf> Has anyone else had to write tests for outgoing email?
2015-02-04T10:54:59 <the-t-in-rtf> I am looking through the options and am thinking of using the library nodemailer uses for its tests.

2015-02-04T11:15:14 <slim_jim> hi folks - tryingto figure out how the device reporting currently works - loads of test files are confusing me
2015-02-04T11:18:33 <slim_jim> kasparnet: any thoughts on ^^ ?
2015-02-04T11:19:12 <kasparnet> hey slim_jim
2015-02-04T11:19:24 <kasparnet> yeah - all those files are generally quite confusing
2015-02-04T11:19:40 <slim_jim> so do we have a device reporter or what happens?
2015-02-04T11:19:50 <slim_jim> eg when sammy logs in on a windows manchine
2015-02-04T11:21:02 <kasparnet> so right now, the only thing that happens is that this file: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/deviceReporter/installedSolutions.json is read
2015-02-04T11:21:06 <slim_jim> is it win32_installed solutions thats says what should be installed?
2015-02-04T11:21:18 <slim_jim> not the win32_* file?
2015-02-04T11:21:19 <kasparnet> all the other files are ignored
2015-02-04T11:21:45 <kasparnet> ... I have a pull request (and have had for 6+ months) pending to move the unnused ones to an example folder, so it\'s clear what\'s used
2015-02-04T11:21:48 <slim_jim> ah. So the device reported simpl returns everything that MIGHT be instaleld on any platform?
2015-02-04T11:22:06 <kasparnet> yeah - and that list is then filtered based on the platform that the user is
2015-02-04T11:22:08 <kasparnet> on*
2015-02-04T11:22:21 <kasparnet> (ie. via the "context" information in the solution registry entries)
2015-02-04T11:22:32 <kasparnet> from what I remember anyway
2015-02-04T11:22:37 <slim_jim> OK. and the solutions registry then gets search for details
2015-02-04T11:22:59 <slim_jim> That\'ll do for now thanks _ i\'m putting together some wiki docs for the tigers
2015-02-04T12:01:45 <kasparnet> oh awesome

2015-02-04T12:47:53 <slim_jim> Bosmon: hi
2015-02-04T12:49:15 <Bosmon> Hi there slim_jim
2015-02-04T12:49:35 <slim_jim> I have a couple of Qs about preference terms
2015-02-04T12:50:51 <slim_jim> My understanding is that http://registry.gpii.org/common/speechRate is a URI, is declared in the new PTD for reference but not access by the GPII
2015-02-04T12:51:10 <slim_jim> the solutions registry defines how this URIs actuall map to a solution
2015-02-04T12:51:29 <slim_jim> is that basically correct and all there is?
2015-02-04T12:52:49 <slim_jim> Bosmon: ^^
2015-02-04T12:53:54 <Bosmon> slim_jim - mostly correct, yes - the URIs are entirely notional
2015-02-04T12:54:04 <Bosmon> And put in for political reasons since the people who advised us were fond of URIs
2015-02-04T12:54:18 <Bosmon> There are other forms for preferences which are just in "application specific terms"
2015-02-04T12:54:25 <slim_jim> ah - yes
2015-02-04T12:54:27 <Bosmon> That is, things which will become settings which are passed directly to the application
2015-02-04T12:54:44 <Bosmon> In case we don\'t have a term in the "common" namespace that corresponds to the setting
2015-02-04T12:55:01 <Bosmon> Or for some other reason, for example the preferences set may have been discovered through snapshotting
2015-02-04T12:55:18 <Bosmon> We also have a "provisional" namespace that you may see in some preference sets
2015-02-04T12:55:51 <slim_jim> ok - good point
2015-02-04T12:55:58 <Bosmon> "provisional-common"
2015-02-04T12:56:42 <Bosmon> Given some of our partners make a fuss if we just add things into "common" without going through the "process" for deciding on its contents through committee, which process they have never bothered to formalise : P
2015-02-04T12:57:24 <Bosmon> Really the preference terms involve some of the most annoying and pointless politics on the projects, since because they are something that everyone can see, there is an enormous amount of "bikeshedding"
2015-02-04T12:57:41 <slim_jim> hehe yeh. Not helped by the arrival of the PTD which no one seems to know about apart form Gregg and Tony
2015-02-04T12:57:52 <Bosmon> So the terms you will see reflect the rather messy outcome of this political process rather than any definite and stable technical decision
2015-02-04T12:58:09 <slim_jim> sure, but puting that BS asside
2015-02-04T12:58:28 <Bosmon> Yes well, it will be a long time before the PTD is a regular part of the workflow of the core architecture
2015-02-04T12:58:46 <Bosmon> In the meantime, we just have what exists inside the testData/preferences directory of universal
2015-02-04T12:59:18 <Bosmon> So - you can consider that the left-hand of this file: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/ontologies/ISO24751-flat.json
2015-02-04T12:59:22 <slim_jim> you mean "rough consensus and working code "? :)
2015-02-04T12:59:35 <Bosmon> This is the closest thing that we have to an authoritative and canonical list of what preferences the system supports
2015-02-04T12:59:45 <slim_jim> ah - that is very useful thanks!
2015-02-04T12:59:57 <Bosmon> Or indeed, what actually is the contents of the "common" namespace
2015-02-04T13:00:16 <Bosmon> None of the people who like to bikeshed so much ever got around to putting up a usable list anywhere else
2015-02-04T13:00:33 <Bosmon> Regardless of how important they apparently feel that the exact contents of this namespace is to our system
2015-02-04T13:00:45 <Bosmon> "in due time", there will be a process
2015-02-04T13:00:50 <Bosmon> In the meantime, there is this JSON file :)
2015-02-04T13:01:05 <slim_jim> all hail the JSON file
2015-02-04T13:01:09 <slim_jim> soooooo
2015-02-04T13:01:39 <slim_jim> Are there docs for how the \'new\' transforms work as they do the real world work of mapping from the prefs (leaf of that URL path) to actuall settings
2015-02-04T13:02:56 <Bosmon> The main documentation we have on the transformation functions work is on this page written by KASPARNETT
2015-02-04T13:02:57 <Bosmon> http://wiki.gpii.net/w/Architecture_-_Available_transformation_functions
2015-02-04T13:03:14 <Bosmon> But I\'m not quite sure what you mean by the "new" transforms since I don\'t think this architecture has changed for nearly 2 years
2015-02-04T13:03:36 <slim_jim> no you are right, I\'m living in the past
2015-02-04T13:04:05 <slim_jim> I used solution specific so it swept past me.
2015-02-04T13:04:14 <slim_jim> Thsi is very helpful
2015-02-04T13:04:18 <slim_jim> one more Q
2015-02-04T13:05:07 <slim_jim> The user tokens format? I understand that may be changing as there were discussions about GUIDs. hat is the status here?
2015-02-04T13:05:25 <Bosmon> user token format is still completely freeform
2015-02-04T13:05:37 <Bosmon> Any UTF-8 string is currently acceptable
2015-02-04T13:05:47 <slim_jim> ok - you just look for the file?
2015-02-04T13:05:56 <Bosmon> Although there are possibly areas where URL escaping might corrupt them, I\'ve been trying to plug these
2015-02-04T13:06:17 <Bosmon> The file - in theory we do have a "production" preferences server but it has not been used in a while
2015-02-04T13:06:18 <slim_jim> so restricted to valid filename on platform?
2015-02-04T13:06:28 <Bosmon> Yes, a valid filename would help :)
2015-02-04T13:06:43 <slim_jim> OH - yes I just realised in my notes I\'ve assume all local. Will come back to that
2015-02-04T13:06:54 <Bosmon> To be further safe, I\'d tend to pick any character that doesn\'t require URL escaping
2015-02-04T13:06:59 <Bosmon> In case you trigger some latent bug
2015-02-04T13:07:09 <slim_jim> yeah, I\'m good at that
2015-02-04T13:07:28 <slim_jim> Thanks fo your help
2015-02-04T13:07:42 <slim_jim> see you next week in Stuttgart?
2015-02-04T13:08:28 <Bosmon> I won\'t be there, but you\'ll get to see COLLINE and KASPARDNITT
2015-02-04T13:10:21 <slim_jim> hehe
