2015-09-28T15:07:30 <colinclark> Hey simonjb
2015-09-28T15:07:38 <colinclark> If you\'re okay with it, I can share a few suggestions for your slides here
2015-09-28T15:07:55 <simonjb> colinclark: yes, please
2015-09-28T15:08:26 * anastasiac has quit
2015-09-28T15:08:27 <colinclark> Slide 5, "User Authentication," I wonder if it\'s worth somehow clarifying that this is a kind of "secondary authentication"
2015-09-28T15:08:39 <colinclark> i.e. that this isn\'t required for keying into a GPII-enabled workstation
2015-09-28T15:08:51 <simonjb> btw, there\'s a meeting scheduled to talk about the chrome extension now (but it hasn\'t started yet) so I might have to jump over to that
2015-09-28T15:08:56 <colinclark> np
2015-09-28T15:09:04 <colinclark> but only for protecting secure aspects of your preferences set such as privacy policies, etc.
2015-09-28T15:09:41 <simonjb> yes, I think that is worthwhile to make clear, agreed
2015-09-28T15:20:27 * alanharnum joined the channel
2015-09-28T15:25:47 <colinclark> simonjb: Your slides look great. Thanks so much for making them!
2015-09-28T15:26:09 <simonjb> colinclark: are the 5 layers correct?
2015-09-28T15:27:09 <colinclark> I believe so, but best to check also with kasparnet
2015-09-28T15:27:16 <simonjb> will do
2015-09-28T15:27:20 <colinclark> he has fully integrated the five-fold path
2015-09-28T15:27:40 <kasparnet> he has done so such thing
2015-09-28T15:27:44 <simonjb> colinclark: thanks very much for looking over the slides
2015-09-28T15:27:50 <simonjb> hey kasparnet
2015-09-28T15:27:53 <kasparnet> :D
2015-09-28T15:27:55 <kasparnet> hey simonjb
2015-09-28T15:29:08 <simonjb> kasparnet: are the following "5 layers" correct? 1. Web content 2. Cloud based Assistive Technologies 3. Browser settings 4. Assistive Technologies installed on the local machine 5. Operating System
2015-09-28T15:29:37 <kasparnet> simonjb: yeah - that\'s correct
2015-09-28T15:29:52 <simonjb> awesome
2015-09-28T15:29:55 <kasparnet> ... I guess we usually list it in the reverse order
2015-09-28T15:29:59 <colinclark> see? kasparnet\'s five fold path
2015-09-28T15:30:16 <kasparnet> colinclark: hey! I dont know what it means, but I dont like the sound of it
2015-09-28T15:31:34 <simonjb> kasparnet: is the order correct but just reversed?
2015-09-28T15:31:43 <kasparnet> yeah, exactly
2015-09-28T15:31:51 <simonjb> ok, I\'ll flip them around
2015-09-28T15:32:04 <simonjb> thanks kasparnet
2015-09-28T15:32:32 <kasparnet> cheers simonjb
2015-09-28T15:32:37 <simonjb> kasparnet: no sign of christophe yet?
2015-09-28T15:35:53 <kasparnet> simonjb: nope -- I think he might have forgotten that he was travelling to madrid or something

2015-09-28T15:49:47 <kasparnet> simonjb, Bosmon: So i\'m running into some weirdness in my attempt to fix GPII-1286
2015-09-28T15:49:54 <kasparnet> this is my pull request https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/395
2015-09-28T15:50:12 <kasparnet> JIRA: https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-1286
2015-09-28T15:51:17 <kasparnet> I\'m getting 2 errors along the lines of 17:50:48.922:  jq: FAIL: Module "acceptanceTests.base.cloudBased tests" Test name "Acceptance test for font and background color transformation in Easit4all" - Message: Expected 1 assertions, but 21 were run
2015-09-28T15:52:02 <kasparnet> I had something similar with chrome, but that disappeared as soon as I separated the testDefs out into a separate file
2015-09-28T15:52:42 <kasparnet> do the easit4all tests do some sort of rerouting that causes this -- or more general, does this issue make much sense to either of you?
2015-09-28T15:52:42 * anastasiac has quit
2015-09-28T15:53:03 <simonjb> kasparnet: the tests fail on master? when did this start happening?
2015-09-28T15:53:23 <kasparnet> simonjb: well - so the problem on master was that the tests never ran
2015-09-28T15:53:33 <simonjb> hmm
2015-09-28T15:53:35 <kasparnet> (that is, the regular chrome/easit4all tests never ran)
2015-09-28T15:53:39 * anastasiac joined the channel
2015-09-28T15:53:41 <kasparnet> due to the if wrapper
2015-09-28T15:54:04 * alanharnum joined the channel
2015-09-28T15:55:04 <kasparnet> btw, the individual tests run just fine
2015-09-28T15:55:28 <simonjb> kasparnet: under what case do they not run?
2015-09-28T15:55:36 <kasparnet> ... but if you just comment out everything but the easit4all tests in all-tests.js, then the error will appear
2015-09-28T15:55:51 <simonjb> ah, now I understand
2015-09-28T15:56:02 * cindyli joined the channel
2015-09-28T15:56:14 <simonjb> the individual tests run, but fail from all-tests.js because of the if test?
2015-09-28T15:56:39 <simonjb> sorry for being slow
2015-09-28T15:57:13 <kasparnet> hehe, no, think I\'m throwing this stuff at you without giving any background
2015-09-28T15:57:23 <kasparnet> so in master, all tests pass
2015-09-28T15:57:44 <kasparnet> but it is because the regular chrome and easit4all tests are never run
2015-09-28T15:58:01 <simonjb> when run from all-tests.js?
2015-09-28T15:58:14 <kasparnet> due to the if statement https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/7df2ac21bdd6db85d5c2a60f04a70bb6691c22a5/tests/platform/cloud/AcceptanceTests_chrome.js#L93
2015-09-28T15:58:18 <kasparnet> yeah, exactly
2015-09-28T15:58:19 <simonjb> but they can be run individually?
2015-09-28T15:58:44 <simonjb> as in: node AcceptanceTests_chrome.js
2015-09-28T15:59:11 <kasparnet> when run individually, it\'ll just start up the test runner and say "no tests run"
2015-09-28T15:59:31 <kasparnet> (this is still in master we\'re talking about)
2015-09-28T16:00:33 <simonjb> I see
2015-09-28T16:00:51 <kasparnet> when removing the if-statements (which I\'ve done in my pull) - things started failing (I believe due to namespace and testdefinition conflicts) -- this solved the issue for chrome
2015-09-28T16:00:59 <kasparnet> but I am getting some weirdness with easit 4 all
2015-09-28T16:01:07 <simonjb> got it
2015-09-28T16:01:19 <kasparnet> ... I mean, it runs now, but it just doesn\'t pass when run with the oauth tests
2015-09-28T16:01:24 <simonjb> I see that other tests such as https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/7df2ac21bdd6db85d5c2a60f04a70bb6691c22a5/tests/platform/cloud/AcceptanceTests_chrome_oauth2.js don\'t have the if
2015-09-28T16:01:44 <kasparnet> yeah - the "if" part shouldn\'t be there
2015-09-28T16:02:04 <simonjb> the tests are interfering with one another?
2015-09-28T16:03:00 <kasparnet> yeah
2015-09-28T16:03:12 <kasparnet> and I cant figure out why the hell this is happening
2015-09-28T16:03:20 <kasparnet> as I\'ve tried separating them
2015-09-28T16:04:19 <simonjb> ok, I don\'t know right now what it might be, but I can take a look
2015-09-28T16:11:07 * clown joined the channel
2015-09-28T16:33:01 * alanharnum joined the channel
2015-09-28T17:16:19 <kasparnet> sorry for disappearing on you, simon -- had to walk through some year 4 / presentation planning with michelled and javi
2015-09-28T17:16:34 <kasparnet> simonjb: it\'s no huge rush with that issue
2015-09-28T17:17:30 <kasparnet> but if you at some point need a distraction from other work, it would be great if you could see if there is any obvious cause that comes to mind
2015-09-28T17:20:34 * the-t-in-rtf joined the channel
2015-09-28T17:22:01 <simonjb> ok kasparnet, I\'m curious now myself about what\'s going on
2015-09-28T17:22:28 <kasparnet> hehe
2015-09-28T17:36:26 <kasparnet> btw simonjb - awesome demo! michelled showed it to us before
2015-09-28T17:36:30 <kasparnet> it looks great
