2015-06-11T12:09:48 <the-t-in-rtf> I am trying to set the container for a child viewComponent.  The selector is unique within the parent component\'s container, but not within the page.
2015-06-11T12:10:13 <the-t-in-rtf> I see messages on component creation about there being more than one of them, when I would expect the creation to be relative to the containing component.
2015-06-11T12:10:34 <the-t-in-rtf> Is there a pattern to define the child selector relative to an arbitrary parent?
2015-06-11T12:10:54 <the-t-in-rtf> like "{that} .class" or "{container} .class"
2015-06-11T12:11:53 <the-t-in-rtf> or is there an alternative to viewComponent that handles child selectors differently?

2015-06-11T12:21:09 <the-t-in-rtf> Found it:  https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/blob/e4f2a064d2a166c2d055360b70ba9bba8e0db813/src/documents/tutorial-gettingStartedWithInfusion/Subcomponents.md
2015-06-11T12:21:30 <the-t-in-rtf> I\'m assuming "{nickname}.container .class" will work

2015-06-11T12:33:22 <the-t-in-rtf> I was able to refer to the parent\'s selectors using "{gradeName}.dom.selector" notation.

2015-06-11T13:11:47 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - that\'s correct, yes
2015-06-11T13:11:52 <Bosmon> Sorry I missed your question earlier
2015-06-11T13:13:51 <the-t-in-rtf> Given that the documentation contained the answer, I can hardly be too cross.
2015-06-11T13:14:16 <the-t-in-rtf> As usual I tried to bend the first nearby answer to my well rather than scrolling down\xe2\x80\xa6 ;)
2015-06-11T13:14:22 <the-t-in-rtf> s/well/will/
2015-06-11T13:14:44 <Bosmon> When you say, "I was able to refer to the parent\'s selectors" you mean, "I was able to refer to the DOM node bound to the parent\'s selector"

2015-06-11T15:00:21 <the-t-in-rtf> Is there a way to use distributeOptions to replace a component in all matching child components with one from the parent?
2015-06-11T15:00:55 <the-t-in-rtf> I am trying to make sure that a complex panel uses a single renderer so that we can send a single request for template content, and avoid compiling common templates more than once.
2015-06-11T15:07:01 <the-t-in-rtf> ping @bosmon
2015-06-11T15:08:42 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - the clearest thing would be to write a grade definition which holds your component reference in a child of itself, and then broadcast that gradeName using the distributeOptions
2015-06-11T15:10:25 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - here is a little sketch: http://pastie.org/10235667
2015-06-11T15:17:34 <the-t-in-rtf> What\'s the simplest gradeName to use for the grade definition?
2015-06-11T15:17:50 <the-t-in-rtf> will fluid.littleComponent work?
2015-06-11T15:17:54 <the-t-in-rtf> @bosmon
2015-06-11T15:18:16 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - our current best practice is to leave the gradeName blank in this case - if you have a grade that can\'t possibly function without being added to another
2015-06-11T15:18:54 <the-t-in-rtf> Ah, got it.
2015-06-11T15:23:58 <the-t-in-rtf> That didn\'t work.  The child components still end up instantiating their own renderer.
2015-06-11T15:24:15 <the-t-in-rtf> @bosmon
2015-06-11T15:25:20 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - perhaps you could check in what you have for us to look at
2015-06-11T15:25:26 <the-t-in-rtf> I can see that they have the grade
2015-06-11T15:26:50 <the-t-in-rtf> @bosmon:  https://github.com/the-t-in-rtf/gpii-handlebars/blob/GPII-1175/src/js/client/multiTemplateAware.js
2015-06-11T15:27:23 <the-t-in-rtf> You can see the previous approach (which works) and the form that uses the grade here:  https://github.com/the-t-in-rtf/gpii-handlebars/blob/GPII-1175/src/js/client/templateFormControl.js
2015-06-11T15:28:53 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - your implementation doesn\'t seem to agree with mine
2015-06-11T15:29:01 <Bosmon> You have directed each component to construct its own renderer
2015-06-11T15:29:40 <the-t-in-rtf> Yes, the base grade can also be used independently.
2015-06-11T15:29:54 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - the problem is in your so-called "singularRenderer"
2015-06-11T15:29:59 <Bosmon> Which doesn\'t live up to its name
2015-06-11T15:30:46 <Bosmon> All you\'ve done is copy out the same definition which is in "templateAware"
2015-06-11T15:30:57 <Bosmon> So it will make absolutely no difference to broadcast the same options a 2nd time
2015-06-11T15:31:12 <Bosmon> The component still ends up with the same options
2015-06-11T15:31:53 <the-t-in-rtf> I see that now.
2015-06-11T15:32:40 <the-t-in-rtf> I reviewed your example and fixed it.
2015-06-11T15:32:40 <the-t-in-rtf> It works now, thanks!
2015-06-11T15:37:07 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - awesome :)
2015-06-11T15:37:28 <Bosmon> CONFIGURATION *IS* GRATE
2015-06-11T15:38:22 <Bosmon> I was worrying a bit that you might run into some obscure kind of "order of expansion and merging" issues, but now my confidence is increased by your positive experience, I realise that you won\'t :)
2015-06-11T15:38:59 <Bosmon> It\'s a hugely clearer model when all you are doing is assembling a JSON document with particular contents
2015-06-11T15:39:15 <Bosmon> As opposed to all the others, where things are actually being EVALUATED as you go
2015-06-11T15:39:38 <Bosmon> Imagine doing this in Lisp, for example, you\'d be constantly having your shoelaces tied together by all kinds of obscure quoting and unquoting issues
