2015-06-08T11:32:27 <the-t-in-rtf> Greetings.   Does anyone know how to refer to a viewComponent\'s container from a selector definition?
2015-06-08T11:33:05 <the-t-in-rtf> I want to define selectors that operate on the container by default, but allow others to override those definitions.
2015-06-08T11:33:35 <the-t-in-rtf> I know that fluid.locate() with no arguments or a bogus argument will return the container.
2015-06-08T11:33:45 <the-t-in-rtf> Can I just define the selector as null or ""
2015-06-08T11:33:46 <the-t-in-rtf> ?
2015-06-08T11:33:55 <the-t-in-rtf> ping @Bosmon
2015-06-08T11:35:31 <Bosmon> Morning the-t-in-rtf
2015-06-08T11:35:33 <Bosmon> You must use ""
2015-06-08T11:35:46 <the-t-in-rtf> I am glad my second guess was reasonable.
2015-06-08T11:35:48 <the-t-in-rtf> :)
2015-06-08T11:36:37 <the-t-in-rtf> Thanks for the confirmation.  I am deep into the handlebars rework we discussed.

2015-06-08T15:12:20 <the-t-in-rtf> I just discovered that using that.locate("") has side effects.  If you use that element\'s methods like replaceWith, the changes are not visible in that.dom (but are visible to jQuery).
2015-06-08T15:12:41 <the-t-in-rtf> Using any named selector within the container results in changes that are visible within that.dom.

2015-06-08T16:21:24 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - see our DOM binder API page at https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/docs/DOM+Binder+API
2015-06-08T16:21:40 <Bosmon> If you use any methods which replace DOM elements wholesale, you need to use the "clear()" method to clear its cache
2015-06-08T16:22:26 <Bosmon> But in general you can\'t expect to replace the container node for a Fluid component completely without disrupting the binder
2015-06-08T16:23:08 <Bosmon> This is the purpose of the special listener which I directed to you earlier, in the prefs framework panels.js:

2015-06-08T16:34:58 <the-t-in-rtf> Thanks.  Is there a general version of that I can reuse?
2015-06-08T16:35:23 <the-t-in-rtf> Or should I just use the five lines of that in my own function?
2015-06-08T16:35:54 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - yes, please copy them, plus add a reference to where the other duplicate is
2015-06-08T16:36:22 <the-t-in-rtf> Sounds good.

2015-06-08T18:33:29 <the-t-in-rtf> Unfortunately, using the existing container\'s constructor and selector results in an empty dom.
2015-06-08T18:34:36 <the-t-in-rtf> @Bosmon: Is there something outside the class you sent that listens to the dom event?
2015-06-08T18:34:53 <the-t-in-rtf> the onDomBind event, I mean?
2015-06-08T18:35:56 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - that function I pasted is bound to the listener
2015-06-08T18:36:20 <the-t-in-rtf> Yes, I did something similar but wired in after the template content was updated.
2015-06-08T18:36:29 <Bosmon> So what is actually in that.container.selector?
2015-06-08T18:36:39 <the-t-in-rtf> just a sec.
2015-06-08T18:37:08 <the-t-in-rtf> .viewport, the correct selector for the container.
2015-06-08T18:37:14 <Bosmon> ok
2015-06-08T18:37:42 <the-t-in-rtf> the constructor appears reasonable, but when called as in the example results in an empty dom.
2015-06-08T18:37:54 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - why do you imagine that is?
2015-06-08T18:38:13 <Bosmon> Does any element matching the selector exist in the document?
2015-06-08T18:38:48 <Bosmon> And when you say "an empty dom", I imagine you mean, "an empty jQuery"?
2015-06-08T18:39:02 <the-t-in-rtf> yes, I can see that I need to restart the server to pick up some template changes.
2015-06-08T18:39:06 <the-t-in-rtf> that may explain it.
2015-06-08T18:40:08 <the-t-in-rtf> Yup, that was it.
2015-06-08T18:40:14 <Bosmon> cool
2015-06-08T18:42:53 <the-t-in-rtf> Thanks again.  I will expand the tests to cover some of the new features in the morning and submit a pull request.
2015-06-08T18:42:59 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - cheers!
