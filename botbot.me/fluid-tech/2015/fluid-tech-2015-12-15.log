2015-12-15T20:12:12 <anastasiac> hi, cindyli, do you think you might have a few minutes this afternoon to pair with me a little bit, to help me understand the prefs framework settingsStore stuff?
2015-12-15T20:12:31 <anastasiac> assuming you understand it...
2015-12-15T20:12:41 <cindyli> sure, anastasiac
2015-12-15T20:12:58 <cindyli> vidyo, anastasiac?
2015-12-15T20:13:01 <anastasiac> sure
2015-12-15T20:29:48 * simonjb joined the channel
2015-12-15T20:31:55 <anastasiac> cindyli, it looks to me like the settingStore is successfully made to be my awesomeCars.prefs.settingStore, but I also see that it still has the contextAwareness option that sets it to a cookieStore - is it possible that the check is overriding my stuff?
2015-12-15T20:32:30 <cindyli> ah ha. right. context awareness, anastasiac
2015-12-15T20:32:47 <anastasiac> so the contextawareness stuff is evaluated later, and overrides what I\xe2\x80\x99ve done?
2015-12-15T20:32:59 <anastasiac> doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that make that storeType option completely and utterly useless?
2015-12-15T20:34:26 <cindyli> i\'m not sure when the context awareness kicks in, anastasiac. it\'s a new concept to me. debugging more...
2015-12-15T20:35:48 <cindyli> one thing u could try is to comment out the context awareness to see if your settings store would take effect, anastasiac
2015-12-15T20:36:43 <anastasiac> ok
2015-12-15T20:39:27 <anastasiac> sure enough, cindyli, if I comment out the context awareness stuff, my settingsstore is used
2015-12-15T20:39:47 <anastasiac> so the question is: is the storeType option obsolete? or is this a bug?
2015-12-15T20:40:10 <cindyli> super. good to know, anastasiac, we should file a jira for this and consult Bosmon about the best practice to override context awareness
2015-12-15T20:41:32 <cindyli> would be nice to still support "storeType", anastasiac, it\'s more consistent with usage of other infusion component
2015-12-15T20:41:38 <cindyli> s
2015-12-15T20:41:52 <anastasiac> yes, so is it a bug that the contextAwareness stuff is overriding it?
2015-12-15T20:42:04 <anastasiac> hopefully, Bosmon will be able to shed some light on this
2015-12-15T20:42:10 <cindyli> agree
2015-12-15T20:42:33 <anastasiac> in the meantime, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to write in the tutorial :-)
2015-12-15T20:42:41 <cindyli> :(
2015-12-15T20:42:57 <anastasiac> well, there are other topics to cover while I wait :-)
2015-12-15T20:43:00 <cindyli> probably work on persistence later
2015-12-15T20:43:19 <cindyli> :)
2015-12-15T20:43:23 <anastasiac> yes, I was hoping ot have something soon, because the IBM folks will be needing info soon
2015-12-15T20:43:54 <cindyli> that\'s true
2015-12-15T20:44:07 * simonjb has quit
2015-12-15T21:13:30 * colinclark joined the channel
2015-12-15T21:42:05 <Bosmon> cindyli - the best practice to override context awareness is other context awareness
2015-12-15T21:42:11 <Bosmon> The system is completely self-contained
2015-12-15T21:43:29 <cindyli> thanks, Bosmon, seems we should re-implement the way that "storeType" is consumed, by using another context awareness
2015-12-15T21:44:11 <cindyli> i mean "storeType" option that\'s passed into the builder
2015-12-15T21:45:16 <Bosmon> cindyli - correct, yes
2015-12-15T21:45:31 <Bosmon> We don\'t go around randomly making little junkheaps of special-cased options any more : P
2015-12-15T21:46:24 <cindyli> :)
2015-12-15T21:46:33 <anastasiac> So Bosmon, would we consider the current implementation of the storeType a bug? or is it obsolete, and we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have that option? I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to figure out what a tutorial on \xe2\x80\x9chow to specify your own settingsStore\xe2\x80\x9d should say...
2015-12-15T21:46:55 * the-t-in-rtf has quit
2015-12-15T21:47:19 <anastasiac> Bosmon: the IBM dev team is going to be wanting to do just this very soon, so I\xe2\x80\x99d like to be able to provide them with some guidance
2015-12-15T21:47:55 <anastasiac> as well as understand the general desired best practice, if that happens to be different than what the IBM team might have to do in the meantime
