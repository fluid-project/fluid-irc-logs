2015-05-18T08:56:13 <the-t-in-rtf> Hi, All.  Do we have a standard way to handle query input?  I assume there is something in the Kettle stack, but have no idea where to look.
2015-05-18T08:56:46 <the-t-in-rtf> Sorry, I mean *escaping* query input, not just query input\xe2\x80\xa6 ;)
2015-05-18T09:27:07 <the-t-in-rtf> Also, anyone know how to increase the timeout for a kettle.request.http.send call?
