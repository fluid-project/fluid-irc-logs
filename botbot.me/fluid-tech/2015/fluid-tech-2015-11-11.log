2015-11-11T13:37:45 <the-t-in-rtf> When using distributeOptions, is it possible to enter an array of values for `target`? I find myself distributing the same value to various grades and would like a shorthand.  @Bosmon
2015-11-11T13:38:50 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - wouldn\'t it be better to give the "various grades" a common parent grade?
2015-11-11T13:39:21 <the-t-in-rtf> Yes, I had thought of creating a marker grade, but I might not know which things I was going to mash up ahead of time.
2015-11-11T13:39:52 <the-t-in-rtf> In that case my only option is to make one rule per grade.
2015-11-11T13:42:25 <Bosmon> Even if you don\'t know what you are going to mash up ahead of time, you could always apply the marker grade to them later
2015-11-11T13:42:34 <Bosmon> Do these targets really have nothing in common at all?
2015-11-11T13:42:36 <Bosmon> What is an example of this
2015-11-11T13:43:04 <the-t-in-rtf> Well, in this case I think your solution is good.  They are all either API routers or handlers used by those routers.
2015-11-11T13:43:16 <the-t-in-rtf> I was finding other cases where generic wiring would reduce the clutter.
2015-11-11T13:43:29 <the-t-in-rtf> If I come up with a real example that\'s not already sinking, I will point it out to you.
2015-11-11T13:43:30 <the-t-in-rtf> :P

2015-11-11T14:08:57 <Bosmon> Please do so :)
2015-11-11T14:09:29 <Bosmon> The biggest problem with all of the examples motivating the so-called "object-orientation", for example, is that none of them are actually realistic examples of what someone would want to do in a real design....
2015-11-11T14:12:33 <Bosmon> We will in time support the comma syntax from CSS for expressing alternation... but I don\'t have time to write a proper parser for it
