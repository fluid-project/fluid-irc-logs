2015-10-05T14:40:54 <Bosmon> Hi kasparnet - I've issued a fixed version of your GPII-1227 pull at https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/401
2015-10-05T14:41:49 <Bosmon> For those who were not following, we received an odd platform-dependent failure on this one, where later resolution of I/O on Windows caused the tests to fail by trying to report the results from the deviceReporter to an instance of the FlowManager that had already been shut down since its test case had finished
2015-10-05T14:42:43 <Bosmon> The workaround had two parts - i) to explicitly check whether the deviceReporter was destroyed or not before firing its response (this is something that we can do more gracefully in a future Infusion), and ii) explicitly calling request.events.onError rather than fluid.fail if we get bad data from the deviceReporter dataSource
2015-10-05T14:43:41 <Bosmon> As a general reminder - fluid.fail should only be used to signal cases which represent implementation failures rather than bad data in the running system - since a node.js process will become unstable if there are uncaught exceptions fired (as well as any running test cases unilaterally failing)
2015-10-05T14:45:27 <kasparnet> awesome, cheers Bosmon - I'll look at it straight away
