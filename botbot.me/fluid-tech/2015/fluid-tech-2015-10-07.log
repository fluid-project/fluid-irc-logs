2015-10-07T12:38:58 <kasparnet> what would you say about a 409?
2015-10-07T12:39:28 <kasparnet> The request could not be completed due to a conflict with the current state of the resource. This code is only allowed in situations where it is expected that the user might be able to resolve the conflict and resubmit the request. The response body SHOULD include enough information for the user to recognize the source of the conflict. Ideally, the response entity would include enough information for the user or use
2015-10-07T12:39:28 <kasparnet> r agent to fix the problem; however, that might not be possible and is not required.
2015-10-07T12:39:28 <kasparnet> Conflicts are most likely to occur in response to a PUT request. For example, if versioning were being used and the entity being PUT included changes to a resource which conflict with those made by an earlier (third-party) request, the server might use the 409 response to indicate that it can't complete the request.

2015-10-07T14:30:24 <cindyli> anastasiac: moving our conversation here as fluid-work channel is getting busy. in terms of passing {that} into speakStickyKeysState(), that's because the method is not used by the component that creates this method, it's distributed into a subcomponent where {that} refers to that subcomponent - https://github.com/fluid-project/first-discovery/blob/master/src/js/panels.js#L381
