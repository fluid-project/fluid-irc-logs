2015-11-02T15:37:37 <simonjb> hi cindyli, if you have time, I had another question about the editPrivacySettings component: should this line be "availableAuthorizedPrefs" rather than "afterAuthorizedPrefsSet" (an event name) https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/gpii-oauth2/gpii-oauth2-authz-server/public/src/components/privacySettings/js/EditPrivacySettings.js#L189
2015-11-02T15:44:09 <cindyli> simonjb: i think the event uses "afterAuthorizedPrefsSet" name is to tell at that point the "availableAuthorizedPrefs" has been set
2015-11-02T15:45:42 <simonjb> cindyli: sorry, I\'m not following -- are you saying that there should be a model property named "afterAuthorizedPrefsSet"?
2015-11-02T15:46:56 * ewbjr joined the channel
2015-11-02T15:49:55 * colinclark has quit
2015-11-02T15:51:30 <cindyli> simonjb: the corresponding model property name for that event is currently called "availableAuthorizedPrefs". the event "afterAuthorizedPrefsSet" is fired when this model value is fetched and set. i\'m a bit concern it might be confusing if we name the event to be same as the model property. probably we can name the model property to be "authorizedPrefs" and the event to be "onAuthorizedPrefsSet" or "afterAuthorizedPrefsSet"
2015-11-02T15:52:55 <simonjb> cindyli: I\'m not suggesting that we name the event the same as the model value -- rather we seem to be initializing a model value with the same name as the event
2015-11-02T15:54:17 <cindyli> ah, right, now i see what you mean. didn\'t see it was in a "model" block. sorry. yes, it seems a mistake
2015-11-02T15:54:23 <cindyli> simonjb: ^

2015-11-02T15:55:49 <simonjb> ok, thanks cindyli -- it would seem right to you then if I rename "availableAuthorizedPrefs" to "afterAuthorizedPrefsSet" on this line? https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/gpii-oauth2/gpii-oauth2-authz-server/public/src/components/privacySettings/js/EditPrivacySettings.js#L189
2015-11-02T15:56:06 <simonjb> sorry!
2015-11-02T15:56:10 <simonjb> inverse of that
2015-11-02T15:56:26 <cindyli> yes, that\'s correct
2015-11-02T15:56:33 <simonjb> rename "afterAuthorizedPrefsSet" to "availableAuthorizedPrefs"
2015-11-02T15:56:35 <simonjb> ?
2015-11-02T15:56:58 <simonjb> cindyli: ^
2015-11-02T15:57:00 <cindyli> yes, i understood what you mean. that\'s correct
2015-11-02T15:57:06 <simonjb> great, thanks
2015-11-02T15:57:09 <cindyli> np
