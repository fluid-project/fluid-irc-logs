2015-11-10T13:12:08 <the-t-in-rtf> I\'m assuming the standalone version of jQuery included with Infusion lacks a find function?
2015-11-10T13:12:13 <the-t-in-rtf> @bosmon
2015-11-10T13:12:29 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - I can\'t understand your question
2015-11-10T13:12:31 * kasparne_ joined the channel
2015-11-10T13:12:32 <the-t-in-rtf> I am trying to interrogate some HTML results without bringing in a full browser.
2015-11-10T13:12:48 <the-t-in-rtf> I am looking at the standalone jQuery included with infusion:  https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/core/js/jquery.standalone.js
2015-11-10T13:13:00 <Bosmon> Yes, the standalone jQuery is not a jQuery - it just includes the barest minimum utilities necessary to get the core framework running
2015-11-10T13:13:07 <Bosmon> YOu should not try to use it as a jQuery substitute
2015-11-10T13:13:23 <the-t-in-rtf> OK, I remembered something coming up when I used the jQuery loaded by Zombie and wanted to check.
2015-11-10T13:13:49 <the-t-in-rtf> "something coming up" = "some half remembered comment that made me think this was possible"
2015-11-10T13:14:04 <the-t-in-rtf> Do we have any good examples of interrogating HTML results from server-side tests (other than using Zombie)?
2015-11-10T13:14:16 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - noone has ever done such a thing
2015-11-10T13:14:25 <the-t-in-rtf> I just want to verify whether an element exists and has text.
2015-11-10T13:14:31 <Bosmon> On the client side we have jqUnit support functions
2015-11-10T13:14:44 <Bosmon> jqUnit.assertNodeExists and jqUnit.assertNode, etc.
2015-11-10T13:15:35 <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/pull/77/files#diff-1f3321d2fbd824f6267f9b9db50d180dR296
2015-11-10T13:15:45 <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/pull/77/files#diff-1f3321d2fbd824f6267f9b9db50d180dR240
2015-11-10T13:19:19 <the-t-in-rtf> Yes, that\'s familiar.  in earlier Zombie tests I previously interrogated client-side jqUnit output.
2015-11-10T13:19:58 <the-t-in-rtf> I would rather not throw Zombie at this particular problem, I may use jsdom this once just to see, as it promises to do what I want:  https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom
2015-11-10T13:20:10 <the-t-in-rtf> I believe it\'s one of the bits that is used within Zombie itself.

2015-11-10T16:53:03 <Bosmon> fluid-everyone - here is an invaluable hint on debugging low-level issues in node.js: http://www.juliengilli.com/2013/05/26/Using-Node.js-NODE_DEBUG-for-fun-and-profit/
2015-11-10T16:53:17 <Bosmon> I only discovered this by reading the source, but it seems that it indeed has been written up at least once : P
2015-11-10T16:53:42 <Bosmon> For example, export NODE_DEBUG=HTTP allowed me to discover that my WebSockets request was indeed reaching the server, despite all the evidence
