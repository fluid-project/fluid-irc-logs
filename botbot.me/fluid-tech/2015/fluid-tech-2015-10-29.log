b'2015-10-29T15:54:24 <the-t-in-rtf> The former, thanks.
2015-10-29T15:54:55 <the-t-in-rtf> I have been trying out Istanbul, a code coverage tool.
2015-10-29T15:55:07 <the-t-in-rtf> It shows me that I don\'t often test for things that should fail.
2015-10-29T15:55:12 <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul
2015-10-29T15:55:27 <the-t-in-rtf> It is ridiculously easy to run on any project that has an "all tests" file.
2015-10-29T15:55:42 <the-t-in-rtf> I have already found a few goofs with unused functions, scripts I forgot to include in all tests.
2015-10-29T15:55:45 <Bosmon> It is now Constantinople
2015-10-29T15:55:58 <Bosmon> But that ain\'t nobody\'s business but the Turks
2015-10-29T15:55:59 <the-t-in-rtf> No, it was Constantinople.
2015-10-29T15:56:10 <the-t-in-rtf> Now it\'s Turkish Delight on a moonlight night.
2015-10-29T15:56:29 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, it is absolutely amazing.   Free, fast easy.
2015-10-29T15:56:34 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - my upcoming docs pull has good explanations of these fixture types now: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/pull/77/files#diff-1f3321d2fbd824f6267f9b9db50d180dR179
2015-10-29T15:56:35 <the-t-in-rtf> I plan to use it on all pull requests.

2015-10-29T15:57:51 <the-t-in-rtf> Is there an example of using expectFrameworkDiagnostic in a case holder?
2015-10-29T15:58:28 <the-t-in-rtf> Sorry, thanks for the doc link, that is helpful\xe2\x80\xa6 :P
2015-10-29T15:58:36 <the-t-in-rtf> But I still want to know how to use it in a case holder.
2015-10-29T15:59:14 <the-t-in-rtf> The errors I am testing for are generally "try to create a thing with bogus options and expect it to complain"
2015-10-29T15:59:32 <the-t-in-rtf> I could write a function to instantiate things, but wanted to know if there was another way.
2015-10-29T15:59:51 <Bosmon> Well, there\'s not much you can do there other than wrap the function which causes the failure in a function which calls this - but that\'s only workable if you expect the failure to be synchronous
2015-10-29T16:00:05 <Bosmon> If you expect the failure to be asynchronous, you\'ll need to do something more like what I pasted in my 2nd link

2015-10-29T17:56:38 <simonjb> cindyli: I\'m refactoring the gpii.oauth2.editPrivacySettings grade into 2 grades: 1) a \'generic\' base grade for selecting preferences 2) new gpii.oauth2.editPrivacySettings which uses the base grade (1) to implement the functionality needed for editing auth decision selected preferences
2015-10-29T17:57:14 <simonjb> I will then use the base grade for adding new authorizations
2015-10-29T17:57:54 <simonjb> in making the base grade a bit more generic, I am thinking I\'ll rename some parts
2015-10-29T17:58:01 <simonjb> and that\'s what I wanted to ask you about
2015-10-29T17:59:08 <simonjb> it looks to me like the "decisionPrefs" model value is the initial set of selected preferences -- and is not kept up to date
2015-10-29T17:59:50 <simonjb> once the selectionTree component is made, that\'s where the model of selected preferences lives
2015-10-29T18:00:06 <simonjb> cindyli: do you remember? is my understanding correct?

2015-10-29T18:00:22 <cindyli> simonjb: reading the code to try to rmb
2015-10-29T18:00:32 <simonjb> if so, I think I will rename decisionPrefs to initialSelectedPrefs or similar
2015-10-29T18:00:44 <simonjb> thanks cindyli -- I know it was a while ago
2015-10-29T18:02:01 <simonjb> cindyli: we\'re just heading out for a walk -- back in a little bit
2015-10-29T18:02:57 <cindyli> yes, simonjb, the "decisionPrefs" model value is the initial set of selected preferences
