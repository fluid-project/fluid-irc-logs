2015-09-22T17:44:10 <anastasiac> cindyli, do you have a moment for a question about how the FD tool interface is translated?
2015-09-22T17:44:34 <cindyli> sure, anastasiac
2015-09-22T17:44:51 <anastasiac> I know it\xe2\x80\x99s based on the defaultLocale stuff, and I found the stuff in Infusion\xe2\x80\x99s fluidRequests.js, in fetchResources, that uses that to change the name of the resource being fetched
2015-09-22T17:45:02 <anastasiac> but that file says \xe2\x80\x9cNOTE: All contents of this file are DEPRECATED and no entry point should be considered a supported API\xe2\x80\x9d
2015-09-22T17:45:07 <anastasiac> am I looking in the wrong place?
2015-09-22T17:45:14 <anastasiac> is this actually taken care of somewhere else?
2015-09-22T17:47:55 <cindyli> anastasiac: fetchResources is the function that fetches correct message files. It should still be in use.
2015-09-22T17:49:55 <anastasiac> so cindyli, the fd tool sets a \xe2\x80\x98locale\xe2\x80\x99 option of the messageLoader, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not clear to me what happens when the language selection is changed. the model changes, but where does the new language code end up that the renderer finds it?
2015-09-22T17:51:51 <anastasiac> the language enactor of the fd tool seems to reload the page when the language changes, but where in the process does the loading know to look at the model for the language key, cindyli?
2015-09-22T17:54:34 <anastasiac> cindyli: I\xe2\x80\x99m also confused about the difference between locale and defaultLocale
2015-09-22T17:54:48 <cindyli> anastasiac: aside from defaultLocale, which is the last fall back if no message bundles are found, there\'s a "locale" that responds to the language selection change. when the page is realoded, the locale value is set to the new selection
2015-09-22T17:56:28 <anastasiac> cindyli: where does the updating of the locale value happen??
2015-09-22T17:57:01 <cindyli> anastasiac: https://github.com/fluid-project/first-discovery/blob/master/src/js/firstDiscoveryEditor.js#L113
2015-09-22T17:57:39 <anastasiac> cindyli: isn\xe2\x80\x99t that a static option that is evaluated at instantiation time?
2015-09-22T17:58:13 <cindyli> anastasiac: yes, that\'s why every language change needs a page reload that causes the FD tool to re-instantiate
2015-09-22T17:58:32 <anastasiac> Ah!!!
2015-09-22T17:58:40 <anastasiac> <big light bulb goes on over anastasia\xe2\x80\x99s head>
2015-09-22T17:58:45 <cindyli> haha
2015-09-22T17:58:52 <anastasiac> ok, I think I get it now
2015-09-22T17:58:55 <cindyli> cool
2015-09-22T17:59:21 <anastasiac> I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t for the life of me see how that value changed, and the answer is: it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t. No wonder i couldn\xe2\x80\x99t figure it out!
2015-09-22T17:59:41 <cindyli> bingo!
2015-09-22T17:59:57 <anastasiac> ok, thanks, cindyli, this helps. I\xe2\x80\x99ll probably ask you to review my tutorial section about this, to make sure I\xe2\x80\x99m getting it right :-)
2015-09-22T18:00:05 <cindyli> sure

2015-09-22T18:24:08 <anastasiac> cindyli: do you have another minute or two?
2015-09-22T18:24:52 <cindyli> anastasiac: i\'m in a meeting right now. can you post ur question here, i will answer. thanks
2015-09-22T18:25:00 <anastasiac> k, no rush
2015-09-22T18:26:03 <anastasiac> I can\xe2\x80\x99t seem to get defaultLocale to work. I have three language bundles: english, french and esperanto. I\xe2\x80\x99ve set defaultLocale to french. If I specify spanish as the locale, I end up with english (the framework\xe2\x80\x99s default) instead of french (my default)

2015-09-22T18:39:32 * clown joined the channel
2015-09-22T18:55:01 <cindyli> anastasiac: it\'s unusual to have messageLoader options defined in the aux schema. these options won\'t be merged into the constructed messageLoader
2015-09-22T18:55:53 <anastasiac> cindyli: what\xe2\x80\x99s the recommended way to specify the locale and defaultLocale, then? Why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t they be merged? Note that the locale option is working
2015-09-22T18:56:03 * the-t-in-rtf has quit
2015-09-22T18:56:40 <cindyli> anastasiac: defaultLocale should be the default in the primary schema
2015-09-22T18:57:32 <cindyli> i\'m a bit surprised that locale option is working :)
2015-09-22T18:58:07 <anastasiac> cindyli: how would the defaultLocale in the primary schema look?? (I thought that was just for preferences) and where should locale be set?
2015-09-22T19:00:51 <cindyli> anastasiac: do you have a language prefs for this demo?
2015-09-22T19:01:06 <anastasiac> no, I just want to be able to set the language
2015-09-22T19:01:19 <cindyli> ok, i see. need to think about it
2015-09-22T19:01:20 <anastasiac> I might worry about a pref later, but for now, no
2015-09-22T19:04:19 * the-t-in-rtf joined the channel
2015-09-22T19:13:06 <cindyli> anastasiac: instead of directly add things into the aux schema, you may wanna create a component and add it as a grade into "loaderGrades" - https://github.com/acheetham/infusion/blob/FLUID-5754%2B/examples/framework/preferences/minimalEditor/js/minEditor.js#L242
2015-09-22T19:14:16 <anastasiac> cindyli: I\xe2\x80\x99m just working through how to do that for message bundle for the main interface (i.e. not in a panel) :-)
2015-09-22T19:14:17 <anastasiac> So would you say that in order to localize the panels, you must use a custom loader grade?
2015-09-22T19:15:09 <anastasiac> and my custom loader grade would use the fullNoPreview grade?
2015-09-22T19:15:11 <anastasiac> like this:
2015-09-22T19:15:13 <anastasiac> fluid.defaults("minEditor.editor", {
2015-09-22T19:15:14 <anastasiac> gradeNames: ["fluid.prefs.fullNoPreview"],
2015-09-22T19:15:16 <anastasiac> ?
2015-09-22T19:19:36 <cindyli> anastasiac: it\'s recommended to use a loader grade for sure. your loader grade doesn\'t need to use the fullNoPreview grade. the loaderGrades in the aux schema would look like
2015-09-22T19:20:01 <cindyli> loaderGrades: ["your.custom.grade", "fluid.prefs.fullNoPreview"]
2015-09-22T19:20:07 <anastasiac> ah, right, ok
2015-09-22T19:20:18 <anastasiac> so what grade would my custom grade use?
2015-09-22T19:21:17 <anastasiac> fluid.prefs.prefsEditorLoader, cindyli?
2015-09-22T19:22:06 <cindyli> your custom grade could be fluid.component
2015-09-22T19:24:05 <anastasiac> ok, that\xe2\x80\x99s working, cindyli, for both locale and defaultLocale. Excellent, thanks. Now I have to figure out about the message bundle :-)
2015-09-22T19:24:20 <cindyli> awesome
2015-09-22T19:24:46 <anastasiac> thanks for all your help, cindyli, I\xe2\x80\x99m learning a lot, and hopefully this will result in a tutorial that\xe2\x80\x99s actually useful :-)
2015-09-22T19:25:32 <cindyli> anytime, anastasiac. it will certainly be an useful tutorial. i trust you :)

2015-09-22T19:39:05 <anastasiac> ah, cindyli, a question: you said that the defaultLocale should be specified in the primary schema. I thought the primary schema was for preferences. How would you specify defaultLocale there? just as a root property with a string value?
2015-09-22T19:47:45 * the-t-in-rtf has quit
2015-09-22T19:58:55 <cindyli> anastasiac: that\'s when you have a language pref, the default value of it will be populated into the defaltLocale. in ur case that doesn\'t have a language pref, using a custom grade is the way.
