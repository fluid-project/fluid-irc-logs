2015-06-26T12:29:05 <the-t-in-rtf> Is there any way to define an array or map of options.selectors?  I ask because I want to make a "toggle" that can be passed a list of selectors to toggle without knowing their names in advance.  I could just pass the raw ".classname" etc. notation, but want to understand if there is a way to do it with Fluid\'s named selectors and that.locate()

2015-06-26T12:30:40 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - I suggest you apply the same scheme for this that you did for the "binding" system that you already wrote
2015-06-26T12:30:54 <Bosmon> That is, draw up some configuration that the component accepts in order to operate the toggle
2015-06-26T12:35:40 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - I assume that by "toggling" you mean either toggling visibility using jQuery show/hide or toggling CSS classnames using jQuery toggleClass

2015-06-26T13:00:29 <the-t-in-rtf> @bosmon, that sounds reasonable, I was just hoping to avoid requiring two definitions (one for the selector, one for the toggle definitions).
2015-06-26T13:03:02 <the-t-in-rtf> Current the component just uses toggle, but toggleClass is a good variation, given that Foundation has its own "hide" class.

2015-06-26T13:26:16 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - I think you can\'t really avoid "two" definitions, since your toggle references will naturally be cast in terms of the selector names rather than the selectors themselves
2015-06-26T13:26:59 <the-t-in-rtf> Yes, that\'s fine.  I ended up making yet another simple shorthand, it\'s comparable to event definitions and not all that odious.
2015-06-26T13:27:01 <Bosmon> That is, you define all the concrete selectors in one place, in "selectors" so that they can be overridden there
2015-06-26T13:27:15 <the-t-in-rtf> If I find cases in which it is bothersome I will provide a convenience class with some kind of expander.
2015-06-26T13:27:18 <Bosmon> And then everything else in the component that refers to markup refers it in terms of entries in "selectors"
2015-06-26T13:28:03 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, no need to convince me, I already did it as you suggest.
2015-06-26T13:28:05 <the-t-in-rtf> ;)

2015-06-26T14:06:37 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - well the record of this chat may yet live to convince others :)
2015-06-26T14:06:54 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - looks like I got confused about our meeting times - are we meant to be meeting today?
2015-06-26T14:17:41 <the-t-in-rtf> Yes, in 45 minutes.
2015-06-26T14:18:39 * clown joined the channel
2015-06-26T14:31:53 * kasparnet joined the channel
2015-06-26T14:38:45 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - is there a chance we could meet sooner?
2015-06-26T14:39:26 <the-t-in-rtf> You\'d have to ask Avtar and others, but I\'m fine.
2015-06-26T14:39:40 <the-t-in-rtf> Simon and I just finished up.
2015-06-26T14:40:25 <the-t-in-rtf> It sounded like earlier was better for @amatas as well.
2015-06-26T14:40:39 <the-t-in-rtf> I *think* it\'s mostly a question of getting hold of Avtar.
2015-06-26T14:40:52 <Bosmon> ok - amatas, colinclark, simonjb - are we ok to meet at 45 past?
2015-06-26T14:41:22 <Bosmon> I discovered I have an appointment coming up soon, unfortunately
2015-06-26T14:41:22 <simonjb> good for me
2015-06-26T14:41:27 <Bosmon> Apologies for screwing up my schedule
2015-06-26T14:41:33 <colinclark> I can do it, yes
2015-06-26T14:41:45 <colinclark> seems like avtar hasn\'t yet arrived?
2015-06-26T14:41:53 <colinclark> and he was the initiator of the meeting
2015-06-26T14:41:54 <simonjb> he isn\'t in the office
2015-06-26T14:41:59 <colinclark> lemme send him a text
2015-06-26T14:42:25 <the-t-in-rtf> I wouldn\'t count on @amatas, IIRC I think the new time was a problem.  He may already be heading into his weekend.
2015-06-26T14:42:30 <the-t-in-rtf> (it\'s nearly 5 here)
2015-06-26T14:42:43 <the-t-in-rtf> Avtar is the key one to get hold of.
2015-06-26T14:45:14 <colinclark> I\'ve texted him, but no response yet
2015-06-26T14:51:32 <simonjb> Avtar just arrived at the office
2015-06-26T15:01:09 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - see VIDDYO link
