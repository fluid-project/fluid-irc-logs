2014-01-29T18:31:01 <michelled> Bosmon: I\'m just reading the changes in the 5185 pull.
2014-01-29T18:31:22 <michelled> I\'m a bit surprised to see that the rangeAnnotation markup moved out of Pager and into PagedTable
2014-01-29T18:31:55 <Bosmon> michelled - PagedTable *is* the top-level component which corresponds to the old "Pager"
2014-01-29T18:32:08 <michelled> oh! thanks - I misunderstood that
2014-01-29T18:32:10 <Bosmon> We can\'t annotate ranges in a pager without a table
2014-01-29T18:32:16 <Bosmon> Since we wouldn\'t know what the data is
2014-01-29T18:32:26 <Bosmon> Well, I mean the "old" Pager rather than the "old old Pager"
2014-01-29T18:33:00 <Bosmon> The "old old Pager" was just a Pager
2014-01-29T18:33:09 <Bosmon> By this meaning the original Pager we had in 2007
2014-01-29T18:34:16 <michelled> ok, just to clarify, with the current, cutting edge Pager, what sorts of things can we page?
2014-01-29T18:34:39 <Bosmon> Well, once again, we can page anything : P
2014-01-29T18:34:55 <Bosmon> For a while, it was hard to page things other than tables
2014-01-29T18:36:33 <michelled> so, if I\'m paging something that isn\'t a table, I wouldn\'t be able to use the tooltip?
2014-01-29T18:36:46 <Bosmon> Right
2014-01-29T18:37:41 <michelled> why do we not have the data if we are paging through it? I\'m pretty confused about this ....
2014-01-29T18:38:15 <Bosmon> There is no data unless there is a table!
2014-01-29T18:38:20 <Bosmon> What could the data be otherwise
2014-01-29T18:38:30 <Bosmon> By itself the Pager is just a set of Paging controls
2014-01-29T18:38:37 <Bosmon> Do you remember the original 17th century pager from 2007? : P
2014-01-29T18:38:59 <michelled> you must think I have a *much* better memory than I do :)
2014-01-29T18:39:07 <michelled> I know it exited in 2007
2014-01-29T18:39:22 <michelled> ok, so without a table it\'s just the controls
2014-01-29T18:39:40 <michelled> so anytime we are paging stuff and actually *showing* what we are paging, it\'s in a table
2014-01-29T18:39:44 <michelled> do I have that now?
2014-01-29T18:40:47 <Bosmon> Well, nearly : P
2014-01-29T18:41:00 <Bosmon> We could be paging and showing stuff that is not being rendered by us
2014-01-29T18:41:09 <Bosmon> For example in the ancient "markup-based pager" samples
2014-01-29T18:41:32 <michelled> ok, makes sense - thanks
