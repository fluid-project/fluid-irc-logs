2014-01-10T17:59:22 <cindyli> yzen: fluid-work is busy and you might missed my post. repost here
2014-01-10T17:59:24 <cindyli> yzen: is there a special protocol used for the gpii websocket? do i need to specify a protocol at creating the websocket instance?
2014-01-10T17:59:39 <yzen> ws:
2014-01-10T17:59:43 <yzen> cindyli: ^
2014-01-10T17:59:49 <yzen> just like in the update tests
2014-01-10T18:04:45 <cindyli> yzen: umm\xe2\x80\xa6 don\'t see websocket instantiation in the update tests. this is how the pcp is doing:
2014-01-10T18:04:47 <cindyli> socket = new WebSocket("ws://localhost:8081/update")
2014-01-10T18:05:14 <cindyli> do we need to specify the 2nd argument for the protocol?
2014-01-10T18:05:17 <yzen> cindyli: yes that\'s the way you do it
2014-01-10T18:05:19 <yzen> no
2014-01-10T18:05:22 <yzen> i don\'t think so
2014-01-10T18:05:28 <cindyli> cool. thanks
