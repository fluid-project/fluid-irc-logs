2014-12-03T15:23:51 <ashgotti> Good morning. Just following up on prefsFramework and enactor.css. It is a required css file but not in the src files.

2014-12-03T15:26:13 <ashgotti> I'm working on a Drupal module and hte best practice is to include the fluid files in a libraries folder and not within my module. I have a compiled .JS file in my module.

2014-12-03T16:16:51 <ashgotti> Also, is there a plan to bring the builder back online? This would solve the problem.

2014-12-03T18:23:26 <ashgotti> Just to update: I got around this by just using the src files instead of compiling. Also, Enactor.css is missing in all the branches, I had to get it from the demo site online.
