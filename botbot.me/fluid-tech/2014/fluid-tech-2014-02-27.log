b'2014-02-27T21:01:38 <sconnolly> I would like the root to be .portlet-list
2014-02-27T21:02:12 <sconnolly> but the expand only kicked off when I added the flc-pager-body-template selector
2014-02-27T21:02:28 <sconnolly> it was complaining I didn\'t have a template
2014-02-27T21:03:38 <sconnolly> it appears tentatively the pager has the right number of pages and when clicked it does go through the right data, the body rendering just is disconnected it seems
2014-02-27T21:03:47 <Bosmon> ok
2014-02-27T21:03:48 <sconnolly> pager = pagerBar
2014-02-27T21:03:59 <Bosmon> Could you make a pastie with your markup too?
2014-02-27T21:04:10 * michelled joined the channel
2014-02-27T21:04:13 <Bosmon> Presumably the selectors you have supplied are still misaligned with it
2014-02-27T21:05:25 <sconnolly> http://pastebin.com/YHNYvRea
2014-02-27T21:09:58 <sconnolly> the pastebin for the up-layout-gallery.js(uPortal code): http://pastebin.com/NMjDNXcA
2014-02-27T21:10:27 <sconnolly> the markup\'s name is gallery.jsp
2014-02-27T21:20:04 <Bosmon> sconnolly - I believe, at line 239 of your up-layout-gallery.js, "renderOptions" should read "rendererOptions"
2014-02-27T21:20:12 <Bosmon> My guess is that your cutpoints are being completely igored
2014-02-27T21:20:14 <Bosmon> ignored
2014-02-27T21:20:20 <Bosmon> Not converted into IGORs : P
2014-02-27T21:25:16 <sconnolly> I think my selector root is being ignored as well, the update didn\'t have a different effect
2014-02-27T21:25:47 <sconnolly> when it is showing the selector for rendering it is showing the default and not the specified root
2014-02-27T21:37:58 * cindyli has quit
2014-02-27T21:42:32 <Bosmon> sconnolly - yes, that\'s right
2014-02-27T21:42:34 <Bosmon> I see the issue now
2014-02-27T21:43:00 <Bosmon> As well as the changes I mentioned, you need to move both "bodyRenderer" and "pagerBar" into a block named "components"
2014-02-27T21:45:31 <sconnolly> That did the trick :) I can\'t thank you guys enough for your help with this!!
2014-02-27T21:47:35 <sconnolly> some of the other items like the filtering isn\'t working but getting those items to display is pretty significant

2014-02-27T22:09:33 <sconnolly> I am going to play with it more before taking more of your time with it. I was pretty stuck getting this to display. I more than likely will be hitting you guys up with more - but I think that will be it for today :)

2014-02-27T17:26:04 <sconnolly> Hi all, I am working on the uPortal upgrade of fluid from 1.4 to master(pre-1.5). I was wondering if someone could help me out with the changes to the pager
2014-02-27T17:26:53 <colinclark> hey sconnolly
2014-02-27T17:27:44 <sconnolly> the current issue I think is with pagerOptions.bodyRenderer, is the type "fluid.pager.selfRender" still valid?
2014-02-27T17:29:23 <sconnolly> (backing up a bit)the current issue is that it looks like it has the data, but it isn\'t making it to the page
2014-02-27T17:29:59 <colinclark> I believe the selfRender type has moved to fluid.table
2014-02-27T17:30:05 <colinclark> so it\'s fluid.table.selfRender
2014-02-27T17:30:51 <sconnolly> will this still work with the pagerBar?
2014-02-27T17:30:57 <colinclark> I believe so, yes
2014-02-27T17:31:18 <colinclark> but to be honest, you\'ll probably get a much more informed response from Bosmon when he arrives in for the day
2014-02-27T17:31:34 <colinclark> It\'s been a while since I\'ve used the Pager in action
2014-02-27T17:32:24 <sconnolly> ok, I appreciate any help :)
2014-02-27T17:37:20 <colinclark> sorry I\'m not more helpful, but I\'ll make sure he gets in touch with you
2014-02-27T17:37:56 <sconnolly> ok thanks :)

2014-02-27T18:40:24 <sconnolly> I think I have made a little progress, with the type change and changing fluid.pager(... to fluid.pagedTable(... It appears to be expanding the columns now in the code and giving an error(which it wasn\'t before). Does this look familiar?
2014-02-27T18:40:53 <sconnolly> Uncaught TypeError: Object empty template supplied to fluid.parseTemplate has no method \'Assertion failure - check console for details\'
2014-02-27T18:41:25 <colinclark> Can you paste the full output into a pastie or pastebin or gist or whatever your favourite tool is, sconnolly?
2014-02-27T18:43:07 <sconnolly> http://pastebin.com/GvZXb0VF
2014-02-27T18:47:26 <colinclark> It looks like you\'re missing the template for your table
2014-02-27T18:47:36 <colinclark> I expect that the options to pagedTable have been moved around a bit
2014-02-27T18:49:05 <colinclark> It looks like, by default, the self-rendering table looks for a template sitting in the DOM with a selector of ".flc-pager-body-template"
2014-02-27T18:49:23 <colinclark> you can of course override this
2014-02-27T18:51:26 <sconnolly> ok thanks, will take a look at adding this
2014-02-27T19:24:15 <sconnolly> adding the selector got passed that issue. It looks like tooltips with bootstrap 3 is next
2014-02-27T19:24:38 <sconnolly> http://pastebin.com/NN1P00QP
2014-02-27T19:26:01 <sconnolly> I am not seeing any tooltip specific items in our code
2014-02-27T19:27:41 <sconnolly> that anonymous function is called twice, the first time through it has an object and works but the second time through it just has the string "option" and fails
2014-02-27T20:03:23 <sconnolly> commenting out the model listener makes the error go away, with that gone - It isn\'t giving any errors but still not displaying the content
2014-02-27T20:03:32 <colinclark> Interesting
2014-02-27T20:03:53 <colinclark> We\'ve been doing some testing with both Bootstrap and Foundation recently
2014-02-27T20:04:02 <colinclark> but haven\'t gotten as far as looking at their JavaScript widgets
2014-02-27T20:04:08 <colinclark> so I don\'t quite understand what it\'s actually doin
2014-02-27T20:04:09 <colinclark> doing
2014-02-27T20:04:21 <colinclark> so does Bootstrap somehow extend the jQuery UI tooltip widget?
2014-02-27T20:04:52 <colinclark> Why is it even involved in this particular process, I wonder?
2014-02-27T20:06:01 <sconnolly> I am not sure either, I think tooltips for us isn\'t a priority til the content is being rendered though
2014-02-27T20:06:14 <sconnolly> Is there a good place to put a breakpoint when it appears the columns are being expanded(data is there) but not being displayed?
2014-02-27T20:07:35 <sconnolly> it looks like by default a dummy item is added so that is all that is being displayed
2014-02-27T20:08:15 <sconnolly> not sure where a good place is to look/breakpoint for the disconnect
2014-02-27T20:10:40 <sconnolly> it looks like when I hit the pagerBar is is going through the data again(I assume that is expected when paging) and it has the right number of pages it looks like(with empty table)
2014-02-27T20:19:35 <Bosmon2> Hi sconnolly
2014-02-27T20:20:06 * Bosmon2 is now known as Bosmon
2014-02-27T20:20:44 <sconnolly> Hi Bosmon, colinclark has been helping me with uPortal\'s upgrade from 1.4 to (pre) 1.5
2014-02-27T20:20:54 <Bosmon> We did talk about these issues when I had a call with James and Drew
2014-02-27T20:21:06 <Bosmon> I\'m not sure how much they passed on to you from our meeting
2014-02-27T20:21:37 <Bosmon> They thought that it might well be that uPortal\'s markup had changed from the version in 1.4 so that the selector you are looking for no longer matches any markup
2014-02-27T20:21:59 <colinclark> This tooltip issue worries me a lot
2014-02-27T20:22:10 <colinclark> Why is Bootstrap trying to get in on the game?
2014-02-27T20:22:10 <sconnolly> There was one issue that the merging of the pull request did take care of but we have some other items
2014-02-27T20:23:01 <Bosmon> I don\'t imagine there is any connection between Bootstrap and the tooltips
2014-02-27T20:24:21 <sconnolly> the type for the body render type was updated to fluid.table.selfRender with colinclark\'s help along with fluid.pager being changed to fluid.pagedTable
2014-02-27T20:25:09 <sconnolly> I added flc-pager-body-template selector
2014-02-27T20:25:56 <sconnolly> for us the tooltips isn\'t a big deal, I did a diff of 1.4 and 1.5 defaults and commented out the model listener which stopped the bootstrap issue
2014-02-27T20:26:42 <colinclark> What is the model listener bound to? Is this a listener that uPortal registered, or one built into the Pager?
2014-02-27T20:27:08 <Bosmon> sconnolly - I did mention fluid.table.selfRender to Drew and James so do make sure you have had a good chat with them about everything they know about the problem :)
2014-02-27T20:27:26 <Bosmon> A good point to set the breakpoint is in RendererUtilities.js line 72
2014-02-27T20:27:37 <Bosmon> At this point you will see the renderer\'s template being evaluated, and the selector it uses
2014-02-27T20:28:01 <Bosmon> the value held in "templateSource" is derived from your configuration to fluid.table.selfRender and should match the template for the pager\'s body
2014-02-27T20:28:21 <sconnolly> it is the listener built into fluid.tooltip defaults
2014-02-27T20:29:00 <colinclark> In that case, I imagine there are smoother ways to disable that listener than just commenting out in the Infusion source code
2014-02-27T20:29:20 <colinclark> but hopefully we can understand better what the underlying issue is that is causing Bootstrap to throw the fit in the first place
2014-02-27T20:29:22 <Bosmon> sconnolly - which listener do you mean exactly?
2014-02-27T20:30:26 <sconnolly> the funcName is: fluid.tooltip.updateContentImpl
2014-02-27T20:30:36 <Bosmon> And can we be clear about whether you have got the main content rendering for the pager first, which you mentioned is a priority?
2014-02-27T20:30:45 <Bosmon> We should try to deal with one problem at a time :)
2014-02-27T20:31:04 <sconnolly> yes, that is definitely the higher priority :)
2014-02-27T20:31:30 <Bosmon> Try the breakpoint I mention and see what selector/content you see
2014-02-27T20:32:56 <Bosmon> Somehow the second paste you sent has been removed
2014-02-27T20:33:15 <Bosmon> You certainly don\'t want to remove the model listener from Tooltips.js since it will just cause the component to do nothing
2014-02-27T20:33:27 <Bosmon> When you get a moment, please refresh your pastie about the tooltip error you are seeing
2014-02-27T20:35:38 <sconnolly> http://pastebin.com/BK8qqdQq
2014-02-27T20:38:07 <Bosmon> Oh, good grief... THAT bootstrap : P
2014-02-27T20:38:14 <sconnolly> for the breakpoint we are using a single built js file, is there a fuction name I could use?
2014-02-27T20:39:28 <Bosmon> Yes, it appears that bootstrap have corrupted the jQuery UI plugin namespace with their own plugin called "tooltip"
2014-02-27T20:39:33 <Bosmon> This is a serious problem
2014-02-27T20:39:50 <Bosmon> And shows how horribly deficient the jQuery UI plugin model is
2014-02-27T20:40:17 <Bosmon> I believe there is a policy in uPortal to only use JavaScript libraries which are capable of coexisting well with others, and can clean up their effects after themselves?
2014-02-27T20:40:39 <Bosmon> It might be worth seeing if there is a way of isolating out this effect of Bootstrap, since it would doubtless cause problems with numerous other jQuery-aware libraries too
2014-02-27T20:41:14 <Bosmon> On line 5 of your stack trace you can see that $.fn.tooltip has been located at $.fn.tooltip bootstrap-3.0.0.js:1438
2014-02-27T20:41:16 <Bosmon> Which should never happen
2014-02-27T20:41:43 <Bosmon> sconnolly, for your other question, the line should read var source = options.templateSource ? options.templateSource : {node: $(container)};
2014-02-27T20:41:55 <Bosmon> And is line 2 of function fluid.renderer.createRendererSubcomponent
2014-02-27T20:42:20 <sconnolly> That is the idea, all the libs should work well with others. ok thanks - I had github open to find it :)
2014-02-27T20:57:33 * michelled has quit
2014-02-27T20:59:42 <sconnolly> it looks like the flc-pager-body-template selector I added is being rendered but it doesn\'t have the cutpoints of the body render specified root
2014-02-27T20:59:56 <sconnolly> I think that is the disconnect
