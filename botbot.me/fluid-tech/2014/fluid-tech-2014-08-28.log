2014-08-28T12:46:17 <the-t-in-rtf> Does anyone know how to reapply bindings (onCreate listeners, for example) when the underlying markup is reloaded from a template?
2014-08-28T12:47:00 * kasparnet has quit
2014-08-28T12:48:43 <the-t-in-rtf> I mean stuff like this:
2014-08-28T12:48:44 <the-t-in-rtf> listeners: {
2014-08-28T12:48:44 <the-t-in-rtf> onCreate: [
2014-08-28T12:48:44 <the-t-in-rtf> {
2014-08-28T12:48:44 <the-t-in-rtf> "this": "{that}.dom.save",
2014-08-28T12:48:44 <the-t-in-rtf> method: "click",
2014-08-28T12:48:45 <the-t-in-rtf> args:   "{that}.save"
2014-08-28T12:48:45 <the-t-in-rtf> },
2014-08-28T12:49:29 <the-t-in-rtf> if whatever the dom.save selector is pointing to is replaced at some point, you lose the binding to the click function.
2014-08-28T12:52:47 <the-t-in-rtf> Can I use the same syntax with other events, or is that only for the implicit "onCreate" event?

2014-08-28T13:14:37 <cindyli1> the-t-in-rtf: the syntax can be used with any events
2014-08-28T13:16:04 <the-t-in-rtf> Thanks cindyli1, I will try moving it to my "hey, new templates!" event

2014-08-28T13:17:17 * cindyli joined the channel
2014-08-28T13:17:50 <cindyli> if the selector is replace at some point, you can, 1. try method "on" with args: ["click", "{that}.save"]; 2. fire an event every time when the selector is ready to re-bind the click handler
2014-08-28T13:18:40 <cindyli> ah, ok. thanks, the-t-in-rtf
2014-08-28T13:19:10 <cindyli> well, wrong channel. but you know what i mean ;)
2014-08-28T13:19:49 <the-t-in-rtf> I think you and I are the only ones active in either, so yes.. ;)
2014-08-28T13:19:59 <cindyli> :)

2014-08-28T14:14:45 <the-t-in-rtf> Thanks again for the tip on moving my onCreate stuff to another event, cindyli.  That works perfectly.
2014-08-28T14:15:21 <cindyli> good to know. anytime

2014-08-28T15:14:34 <the-t-in-rtf> I\'m assuming this is a better room for general questions about making things work using fluid?
2014-08-28T15:15:06 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, assuming that, I am having trouble getting access to the element clicked from an invoker that\'s bound to the "click" event for a selector
2014-08-28T15:15:22 <the-t-in-rtf> in plain old jQuery, "this" would be the element clicked implicitly
2014-08-28T15:15:40 <the-t-in-rtf> I can\'t seem to get the args right to access the element clicked
2014-08-28T15:15:43 * simonjb joined the channel
2014-08-28T15:15:47 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyone have an example of something like that?
2014-08-28T15:16:10 <the-t-in-rtf> I can get {that} and the event {arguments}.0

2014-08-28T15:23:38 <cindyli> the-t-in-rtf: hopefully this example may help -

2014-08-28T15:37:47 <the-t-in-rtf> unfortunately there is a list of these controls and that passes them all in.  It\'s good to have for future reference, though.
2014-08-28T15:38:16 <the-t-in-rtf> Turns out the jQuery event already has what I need, chrome\'s debugger had just collapsed it too much to see what I was looking for.
2014-08-28T15:38:21 <the-t-in-rtf> :|
2014-08-28T15:38:30 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, thanks again, cindyli.
2014-08-28T15:39:28 <cindyli> np, the-t-in-rtf. glad you found something that might be useful
