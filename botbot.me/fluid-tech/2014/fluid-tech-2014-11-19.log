2014-11-19T16:24:22 <anastasiac> hi, ashgotti
2014-11-19T16:24:28 <ashgotti> Hi Anastasiac!
2014-11-19T16:24:34 <ashgotti> Almost done with my Drupal module
2014-11-19T16:24:38 <anastasiac> excellent!
2014-11-19T16:24:50 <ashgotti> Set up multilingual but have run into one last obstacle: the table of contents toggle (on/off)
2014-11-19T16:25:17 <ashgotti> It's not in /preferences/messages but is hard coded data attributes. Any recommendations on how to set those up to be multilingual?
2014-11-19T16:25:58 <anastasiac> oh, dear that\xe2\x80\x99s a bug! Is it the title that\xe2\x80\x99s not internationalizable, or the contents of the preferences panel?
2014-11-19T16:27:02 <anastasiac> it\xe2\x80\x99s the title, ok, I can see where that\xe2\x80\x99s hard-coded in the subcomponent template\xe2\x80\xa6 hm\xe2\x80\xa6
2014-11-19T16:28:11 <anastasiac> ashgotti, I suspect you\xe2\x80\x99re out of luck because of this bug, but it\xe2\x80\x99s possible that cindyli or Justin_o might know something about this that I don\xe2\x80\x99t. I can\xe2\x80\x99t think of a reasonable workaround off the top of my head...
2014-11-19T16:29:02 <anastasiac> ashgotti, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a meeting right now, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll be back in about a half hour. I\xe2\x80\x99ll chat with cindyli and Justin_o to see if we can come up with any solutions
2014-11-19T16:29:33 <ashgotti> Thanks so much!
2014-11-19T16:29:52 <ashgotti> I tried to use jquery to override the data attributes but due to them being in an iframe, it wasn't working
2014-11-19T16:30:49 <ashgotti> I also tried putting the html templates in language folders but that seemed to break the whole script

2014-11-19T17:21:16 <Justin_o> ashgotti: are you using the 1.5 release, or a build from master?
2014-11-19T17:22:05 <ashgotti> justin_o: I'm using the 1.5 release I believe. Anyway I can double check, it's been a few weeks
2014-11-19T17:24:24 <Justin_o> ashgotti: if you could let me know that would helpful. I think we could probably fix it but you'd have to create a new build of it. It won't be in a release yet
2014-11-19T17:25:03 <ashgotti> I believe it is just from 1.5
2014-11-19T17:25:41 <ashgotti> I copied the components, framework, lib, and module folders to my library folder in Drupal and created a custom module to load the infusion-custom.js and css

2014-11-19T17:56:40 <Justin_o> ashgotti: okay... i won't have time to look at it today, but will try to look at it tomorrow
2014-11-19T17:56:59 <ashgotti> Ok thank you, I'll check-in tomorrow
2014-11-19T17:57:10 <Justin_o> ashgotti: sounds good
