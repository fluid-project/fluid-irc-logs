2014-02-06T18:29:18 <jwennmacher> Hi everyone
2014-02-06T18:29:20 <jwennmacher> I have an issue migrating uPortal code from fluid 1.4 to fluid 1.5.
2014-02-06T18:29:32 <jwennmacher> Is there documentation on the event API changes?  In our existing code, we have an event handler that accepts 3 parameters; the 3rd parameter is the fluid pager component (https://github.com/Jasig/uPortal/blob/master/uportal-war/src/main/webapp/media/skins/common/javascript/uportal/up-layout-draggable-manager.js#L366).
2014-02-06T18:29:41 <jwennmacher> that.initDragAndDrop = function (newModel, oldModel, pager) {
2014-02-06T18:29:54 <jwennmacher> In fluid 1.4, pager.js fires a model changed event and includes the pager object as the 3rd parameter (https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/infusion-1.4/src/webapp/components/pager/js/Pager.js#L545).
2014-02-06T18:30:01 <jwennmacher> that.events.onModelChange.fire(newModel, that.model, that);
2014-02-06T18:30:11 <jwennmacher> In fluid 1.5, that 3rd parameter is removed (https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/components/pager/js/Pager.js#L369).
2014-02-06T18:30:18 <jwennmacher> that.events.onModelChange.fire(newModel, oldModel);
2014-02-06T18:30:26 <jwennmacher> I haven\'t yet figured out how the pager event handler (initDragAndDrop) is supposed to know how to find the fluid pager component on the page that generated the event without it being passed in, so we get a javascript error "Cannot read property \'container\' of undefined at https://github.com/Jasig/uPortal/blob/master/uportal-war/src/main/webapp/media/skins/common/javascript/uportal/up-layout-draggable-manager.js#L370.
2014-02-06T18:30:36 <jwennmacher> Is there a best practice way of handling that in fluid 1.5?  Is it a bug?
2014-02-06T18:32:28 <jwennmacher> If it helps, the fluid pager is configured by https://github.com/Jasig/uPortal/blob/master/uportal-war/src/main/webapp/media/skins/common/javascript/uportal/up-layout-gallery.js#L261.  The line that starts firing the model changed sequence is
2014-02-06T18:32:38 <jwennmacher> that.state.pager.events.initiatePageSizeChange.fire(that.options.pageSize);
