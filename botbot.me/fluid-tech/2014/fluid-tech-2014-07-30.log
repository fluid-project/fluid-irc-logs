2014-07-30T16:02:40 <cindyli1> Bosmon7, Justin_o: I have a jquery element - $("body").find("iframe").contents().find("body")
2014-07-30T16:02:43 <cindyli1> i wonder where in the default options this element can be defined so that it can be referred by a listener "this" property. "selectors" block doesn\'t seem like a right place.
2014-07-30T16:03:17 <Bosmon7> cindyli1 - it\'s certainly a very strange kind of search
2014-07-30T16:03:26 <Bosmon7> But yes, you can register in selectors as a raw function
2014-07-30T16:03:54 <Bosmon7> I would create a raw global function that performs this search with a suitable name, and register that instead
2014-07-30T16:05:16 <cindyli1> Bosmon7: do you mean use that function or a invoker in "this" property?
2014-07-30T16:05:39 <Bosmon7> cindyli1 - well, an invoker is another option, yes
2014-07-30T16:05:54 <Bosmon7> But if you want to register it in "selectors" it will have to be just as a function
2014-07-30T16:05:54 <cindyli1> ok. trying. thanks, Bosmon7
