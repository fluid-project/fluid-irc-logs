2014-01-30T16:50:58 <anastasiac> cindyli, do you recall why the video player demos use fluid.invoke() to create the video player, instead of just calling fluid.videoPlayer() ?
2014-01-30T16:52:44 <cindyli> not sure why, anastasiac
2014-01-30T16:53:08 <anastasiac> it seems to work without invoke, but without knowing why you used it, I\'m reluctant to change it
2014-01-30T16:55:59 <anastasiac> cindyli, the video player demos also launch the settings store, enhancer and panel separately, instead of using the one-stop option. Do you recall why?
2014-01-30T16:57:39 <cindyli> anastasiac: i was browsing thru the history, the change to fluid.invoke() seems from your commit: https://github.com/cindyli/videoPlayer/commit/61354e49814ac4b2ad17f2cf98cb0b876d602262#diff-1
2014-01-30T16:58:31 <cindyli> anastasiac: the infusion version I used for upgrading video player didn\'t have the on stop function yet
2014-01-30T16:58:45 <cindyli> typo, "one"
2014-01-30T16:58:51 <anastasiac> ah
2014-01-30T16:58:52 <anastasiac> ok
2014-01-30T16:59:01 <anastasiac> thanks, cindyli
2014-01-30T16:59:04 <cindyli> np

2014-01-30T21:36:34 <michelled> Bosmon: I think I\'ve done an exhaustive test of 5185 in FF now
2014-01-30T21:36:57 <Bosmon> michelled - thanks, I can reproduce your tooltip hanging issue and will look at it this evening
2014-01-30T21:36:59 <michelled> I\'ll do some spot testing in Chrome and IE
2014-01-30T21:37:03 <Bosmon> Well caught
2014-01-30T21:37:34 <michelled> cool - what do you think about the other issue? I think it isn\'t important enough to hold out this pull request
2014-01-30T21:44:30 <Bosmon> I haven\'t managed to try reproducing that yet - too busy with KINGG in the other channel : P
2014-01-30T21:44:39 <Bosmon> I assume that it is a new issue and isn\'t visible in the current master trunk?
2014-01-30T21:50:35 <michelled> yes
2014-01-30T21:50:57 <michelled> and actually, I think I just saw it in the main UIO demo on Chrome, so I guess we\'ll have to look into it
2014-01-30T21:52:46 <michelled> but I can\'t seem to reproduce it in the main demo - I just saw it once
