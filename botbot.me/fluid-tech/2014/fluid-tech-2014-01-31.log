2014-01-31T23:10:44 <jwennmacher> Question: I was looking to get a build of master which has FLUID-5185 included.  Per the build readme there is a build version at http://build.fluidproject.org/infusionBuilder/html/InfusionBuilder.html, but I get a 404.  Is this site still valid?
2014-01-31T23:10:55 <jwennmacher> http://builder.fluidproject.org/ fails as well
2014-01-31T23:11:16 <colinclark> Hey James
2014-01-31T23:11:21 <jwennmacher> Hi
2014-01-31T23:11:31 <colinclark> I think the uPortal builds of Infusion are quite customized anyway
2014-01-31T23:11:40 <colinclark> so you'll want make a build with Ant
2014-01-31T23:11:58 <colinclark> justin_o is deep in the midst of replacing our build infrastructure with Grunt, but he's not quite done
2014-01-31T23:12:09 <colinclark> so ant builds are, unfortunately, where it's at
2014-01-31T23:12:24 <jwennmacher> OK. Can do. Thanks! :-)
2014-01-31T23:12:31 <colinclark> http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Custom+Infusion+Builds+With+Ant
2014-01-31T23:12:39 <colinclark> I believe uPortal's custom build omitted, at very least, jQuery and jQuery UI
2014-01-31T23:12:52 <colinclark> but I'm sure Jen documented the specifics somewhere
2014-01-31T23:13:05 <colinclark> so that you can produce a build that is like the one you've already got
2014-01-31T23:13:12 <colinclark> and if you have any trouble, let us know
2014-01-31T23:13:30 <colinclark> I just had to migrate to a new laptop, otherwise I'd make a build for you right now
2014-01-31T23:13:35 <jwennmacher> OK thanks.  I'll see if I can find something, or talk to Jen.
2014-01-31T23:13:58 <Bosmon> How is Jen doing these days :)
2014-01-31T23:14:06 <colinclark> I haven't talked to her in ages
2014-01-31T23:14:16 <jwennmacher> Thanks.  I had the new laptop experience a few months ago.  Seems like it takes a while to get everything back in plac.e
2014-01-31T23:14:28 <colinclark> yeah, it's a drag
2014-01-31T23:14:30 <jwennmacher> It has been a while for me too since she moved to Google.
2014-01-31T23:14:44 <jwennmacher> So a good opportunity to touch base :-)
2014-01-31T23:14:57 <colinclark> How are things going at Unicon, jwennmacher? How's Gary? And Bosmon's old partner-in-crime, AZ?
2014-01-31T23:17:44 <jwennmacher> Unicon is doing well.  Still lots of projects and activity, including some in the portal project where I'm working.  Gary T has had a challenge with valley fever really kicking his back side for many months and making him extremely fatigued.  It comes and goes a bit for him.  Last I talked with Jen, just after she went to Google, she was doing well and liked it quite a bit.
2014-01-31T23:20:00 <colinclark> oh no!
2014-01-31T23:20:08 <colinclark> I hope Gary feels better soon
2014-01-31T23:20:12 <colinclark> poor guy
2014-01-31T23:21:15 <jwennmacher> Yep.  Gary's a great guy.  Shame to see him have to deal with it.  I guess he is one of the lucky few that valley fever hit hard.  AZ - Aaron Zeckoski?
2014-01-31T23:21:42 <jwennmacher> or I should have said unlucky few.
2014-01-31T23:22:22 <jwennmacher> I apologize .. I have to head out to take my son to Cub Scouts.  Thanks for the help.  I hope you all have a great weekend!
