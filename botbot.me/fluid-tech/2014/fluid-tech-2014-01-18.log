2014-01-18T01:20:26 <sgithens> colinclark: It's to see your flocking messages over the weekend, knowing that you're also keeping us company hacking at this time of night :)
2014-01-18T01:20:38 <sgithens> s/to see/nice to see/
2014-01-18T01:20:48 <colinclark> :)
2014-01-18T01:20:50 <colinclark> Thanks
2014-01-18T01:20:56 <colinclark> That was just the most terrifying thing
2014-01-18T01:21:02 <colinclark> merging two repositories into one while retaining history
2014-01-18T01:21:07 <colinclark> but Git is pretty marvellous
2014-01-18T01:21:11 <sgithens> oh wow, yeah
2014-01-18T01:25:35 <colinclark> what are you hacking on, sgithens?
2014-01-18T01:26:44 <sgithens> campus stuff actually.  Importing H&E images.  I didn't get a lot done today, I worked from home and their was a fire across the street so I spent some time gawking and housing the neighbors cat.
2014-01-18T01:27:10 <sgithens> however, I did also pick up my GPII Macbook today, so when I finish this stuff I'm going to start installing windows on it
2014-01-18T01:27:22 <sgithens> and get stuff running on it for Philly
2014-01-18T01:28:36 <sgithens> colinclark: WIll probably get back in touch with couch again.  Do you know if Yura actually managed to grab my gpii couch thing and put it back in uni?
2014-01-18T01:29:13 <colinclark> I don't know
2014-01-18T01:29:15 <colinclark> I think he did
2014-01-18T01:29:20 <colinclark> but I don't know for sure
2014-01-18T01:29:26 <colinclark> I expect to still see him on IRC
2014-01-18T01:29:47 <colinclark> so despite his departure, you should be able to ask him one of these days
2014-01-18T01:31:12 <sgithens> tuesday is his last day right :(
2014-01-18T01:41:42 <colinclark> no, today was
2014-01-18T01:41:44 <colinclark> :(
