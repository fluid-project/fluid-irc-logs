2014-04-11T13:12:03 <the-t-in-rtf> Is there a demo site for the upcoming release of infusion?
2014-04-11T13:13:35 <the-t-in-rtf> Also, silly question maybe, but what's the purpose of the GPII fork of the fluid-project infusion repo?
2014-04-11T13:13:58 <colinclark> http://build.fluidproject.org/
2014-04-11T13:14:58 <colinclark> And the fork, I have no idea
2014-04-11T13:15:18 <colinclark> but presumably it involved folding in some not-yet-ready features for the last round of pilots
2014-04-11T13:15:54 <the-t-in-rtf> So the fluid one is the main one if I just want the source of infusion, etc.
2014-04-11T13:16:10 <colinclark> yes
2014-04-11T13:16:15 <the-t-in-rtf> great
2014-04-11T13:17:19 <the-t-in-rtf> I wanted to start learning the pager component and others for the next CTR update, the new site is a bit different but I can already see what I need.
2014-04-11T13:17:20 <the-t-in-rtf> Thanks.
2014-04-11T13:17:56 <the-t-in-rtf> I had an open question earlier about getting access to fix a typo in the infusion documentation.
2014-04-11T13:18:08 <the-t-in-rtf> \x03http://wiki.fluidproject.org/x/KQDcAQ
2014-04-11T13:18:15 <the-t-in-rtf> Apparently I can't edit that.
2014-04-11T13:20:14 <the-t-in-rtf> Also, are we planning to redirect http://fluidproject.org/products/infusion/infusion-demos/ to build.fluidproject.org?  The readme for master still points to the 1.4 sandbox.
