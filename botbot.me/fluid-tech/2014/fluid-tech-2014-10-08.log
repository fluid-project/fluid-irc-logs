2014-10-08T20:41:57 <colinclark> michelled: I was just rambling to you over private IM about security, privacy and oauth
2014-10-08T20:42:01 <colinclark> and figured it might as well go here
2014-10-08T20:42:39 <colinclark> I think I was in the midst of saying that the GPII will ultimately need to store some aspect of a user\'s "identity" itself
2014-10-08T20:42:52 <colinclark> where identity is in quotes because I hope we can keep this kind of information to a mininum
2014-10-08T20:43:18 <colinclark> in the PMT designs, based on discussions we had on the architecture mailing list, I think it become clear that there are essentially two supported ways to "register" with the GPII
2014-10-08T20:43:33 <colinclark> one can be entirely anonymous and simply use the PMT to make a preference set
2014-10-08T20:43:45 <colinclark> it will be assigned what I think sgithens___ would call a "GUK
2014-10-08T20:43:51 <colinclark> GPII Unique Key
2014-10-08T20:44:21 <colinclark> Joanna and Dana had something in some of the wireframes that involved giving the user a really scary looking "reset code"
2014-10-08T20:45:06 <colinclark> which they could use to log into the PMT manually if they lost the physical key-in device they had provisioned
2014-10-08T20:45:37 <colinclark> The other, presumably more common, way will to specify an email address and password
2014-10-08T20:45:54 <colinclark> at which point you will be able to, if necessary, log in and reprovision a physical device
2014-10-08T20:46:10 <colinclark> I guess what\'s notable at this level is that we\'ve still got a "traditional
2014-10-08T20:46:16 <colinclark> identity management problem
2014-10-08T20:48:02 <colinclark> in that we will want to support connections with other sources of identity
2014-10-08T20:48:27 * Bosmon joined the channel
2014-10-08T20:48:27 <colinclark> So, sgithens___\'s context is the most concrete
2014-10-08T20:48:48 <colinclark> A student has an"identity" with the university
2014-10-08T20:49:04 <colinclark> and thus a library card
2014-10-08T20:49:14 <colinclark> probably containing their student number, let\'s say
2014-10-08T20:49:40 <colinclark> Now, this student will want to be able to key into the GPII using just this library card
2014-10-08T20:50:08 <colinclark> let\'s say, for simplicity\'s sake that there is some kind of RFID chip on the library card, and it contains the student\'s university student number
2014-10-08T20:50:41 <colinclark> at that point, when they flash their library card in front of the GPII-enabled workstation in the computer lab at the library, they expect the computer to adapt to them
2014-10-08T20:51:06 <colinclark> So, this is basically a kind of--forgive the word--"alias" for their GUK
2014-10-08T20:51:30 <colinclark> i.e. student number 123 points to GUK 456 or whatever
2014-10-08T20:51:37 <colinclark> we always imagined that we wouldn\'t actually imprint GUKs anywhere
2014-10-08T20:51:55 <colinclark> that a USB stick or an RFID tag would get its own ID
2014-10-08T20:52:11 <colinclark> which would then be looked up by the GPII, internally, to the GUK
2014-10-08T20:52:45 <colinclark> So I guess, in the abstract, these two things are really the same sort of problem
2014-10-08T20:53:29 <colinclark> i.e. a means of indirection between a) some arbitrary ID and physical way of keying in and b) a GPII-internal way of identifying the user
2014-10-08T20:54:24 <colinclark> And this is somewhat naively represented in this diagram: http://wiki.gpii.net/images/1/11/D105.2.token-indirection.png
2014-10-08T20:55:24 <colinclark> But to me, the most important security issue in our world actually isn\'t really related to identifying the user
2014-10-08T20:55:40 <colinclark> so much as identifying that some random third-party service is allowed to access a user\'s preference set
2014-10-08T20:56:03 <colinclark> as it is today, anyone can just make a request to the Preference Server and say, "hey, give me colin\'s preferences"
2014-10-08T20:56:22 <colinclark> Hey, give me Sammy\'s preferences: http://preferences.gpii.net/user/sammy
2014-10-08T20:56:37 <michelled> yeah, that\'s certainly not ok
2014-10-08T21:00:26 <colinclark> similarly, the cloud based flow maanger
2014-10-08T21:00:41 <colinclark> "Hey CBFM, I\'m GNOME. Give me Sammy\'s preferences": http://flowmanager.gpii.net/sammy/settings/%7B%22OS%22:%7B%22id%22:%22linux%22%7D%2C%22solutions%22:%5B%7B%22id%22:%22org.gnome.desktop.a11y.magnifier%22%7D%5D%7D
2014-10-08T21:03:16 <Bosmon> colinclark - so what does this mean?
2014-10-08T21:04:53 * clown has quit
2014-10-08T21:05:08 <colinclark> sorry, one sec
2014-10-08T21:06:28 <colinclark> So I guess this last URL summarizes, to me, the biggest issue we have related to security and privacy at this very moment
2014-10-08T21:06:33 <colinclark> which is that it begs two questions:
2014-10-08T21:06:45 <colinclark> 1. Are you really GNOME?
2014-10-08T21:06:46 <colinclark> and
2014-10-08T21:07:00 <colinclark> 2. Did Sammy say you could access his preferences?
2014-10-08T21:07:29 <colinclark> does that make sense?
2014-10-08T21:07:38 <colinclark> i am just summarizing things we\'ve talked about many times
2014-10-08T21:07:43 <colinclark> so am clear in my own mind
2014-10-08T21:08:32 <colinclark> I have to run to the chiropractor
2014-10-08T21:08:39 <michelled> yes, it covers some of what we were talking about earlier - the idea of two secrets
2014-10-08T21:08:46 <Bosmon> We could summarise them any number of times
2014-10-08T21:08:55 <Bosmon> And yet only become a little clear about what this all means
2014-10-08T21:09:12 <colinclark> but I think in the case of #1, an OAuth workflow in front of the CBFM will allow us to give a third-party web service a token that is an expression of our confidence that they are who they say they are
2014-10-08T21:09:32 <colinclark> as well as, for #2, another token that confirms Sammy\'s approval of their ability to access his preferences
2014-10-08T21:10:08 <colinclark> These two things are essential for us to be able to stop allowing people to randomly access preference sets
2014-10-08T21:10:25 <colinclark> and this should be the feature of the "security gateway" that we implement first
2014-10-08T21:10:52 <colinclark> So a user of a third-party web service will not have to give them their GPII username/password/GUK/token/whatever
2014-10-08T21:11:21 <Bosmon> colinclark - does this not imply that we must be the OAuth provider ourselves?
2014-10-08T21:11:24 <colinclark> yes
2014-10-08T21:11:27 <colinclark> I believe it does
2014-10-08T21:11:28 <Bosmon> ok
2014-10-08T21:11:55 <colinclark> does this seem coherent to you simonjb?
