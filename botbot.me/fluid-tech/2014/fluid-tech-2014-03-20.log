2014-03-20T14:38:55 <chrispetsos> Hi Justin_o, just saw your comment on https://github.com/GPII/prefsEditors/pull/48
2014-03-20T14:39:22 <Justin_o> chrispetsos: hello
2014-03-20T14:39:48 <chrispetsos> I think i will feel more comfortable having this merged in the version of Infusion compiled for the prefsEditors repo
2014-03-20T14:39:56 <chrispetsos> will this land there anytime soon?
2014-03-20T14:39:57 <Justin_o> chrispetsos: yes.. i think you won\'t have to manage which ones should/shouldn\'t be saved anymore, should be part of the save operation of the prefs framework
2014-03-20T14:40:37 <Justin_o> chrispetsos: yes.. that will have to be updated.. would you be able to do it? if not i can start a branch off for you
2014-03-20T14:41:58 <chrispetsos> Justin_o  well, i haven\'t done that in the past. You starting a branch would be great...
2014-03-20T14:44:26 <chrispetsos> Justin_o: having this removes the need for the ModelMonitor i\'ve created from the first place. Is that correct?
2014-03-20T14:46:48 <Justin_o> chrispetsos: i believe so yes.. and sure i can start the branch for you.. i\'ll try to have that done shortly
