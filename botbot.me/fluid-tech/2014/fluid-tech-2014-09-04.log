2014-09-04T14:03:21 <the-t-in-rtf> I was checking to see if we had cookie handling in infusion, but didn\'t see anything.  I assume we bring in the jquery cookie plugin or the like as needed?

2014-09-04T16:18:24 <Bosmon> kasparnet, colinclark
2014-09-04T16:18:38 <Bosmon> I\'ve found an extremely peculiar effect somewhere in the Kettle testing system
2014-09-04T16:18:50 <Bosmon> Where it seems possible for a test which hasn\'t even executed yet to cause an earlier test to fail
2014-09-04T16:19:15 <Bosmon> I have a situation where commenting out SocketTests.js from all-tests.js testIncludes will cause SessionTests.js tests to pass
2014-09-04T16:19:25 <Bosmon> Even though they are 2 steps earlier than it in the test sequence
2014-09-04T16:19:44 <Bosmon> The symptoms seem to involve having "dirty" components lying around in the component tree from earlier tests
2014-09-04T16:19:57 <colinclark> wow
2014-09-04T16:19:59 <colinclark> ouch
2014-09-04T16:19:59 <Bosmon> And I think kasparnet had noticed that tests would randomly pass and fail sometimes
2014-09-04T16:20:09 <Bosmon> And this convinces me that (in this area at least) he is not insane
2014-09-04T16:20:31 <Bosmon> My suspicion is that there is an IoC aliasing bug somewhere, of the kind we have had a couple of times before
2014-09-04T16:20:49 <Bosmon> Where some kind of "live material" sneaks into configuration structures which are meant to be immutable
2014-09-04T16:21:22 <Bosmon> The situation is that the "cookie jar" resolved by one test is actually one that was constructed for a previous test fixture
2014-09-04T16:22:27 <Bosmon> On the other hand, there is this extremely dubious piece of code here:
2014-09-04T16:22:28 <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/blob/master/test/utils/js/KettleTestUtils.js#L131
2014-09-04T16:23:18 <Bosmon> ah!
2014-09-04T16:23:19 <Bosmon> This is it!
2014-09-04T16:23:28 <Bosmon> A freak train accident of two bugs in one
