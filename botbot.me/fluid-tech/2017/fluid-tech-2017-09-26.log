2017-09-26T21:34:56 <simonjb> Bosmon: I can verify and merge https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/555 tomorrow
2017-09-26T21:36:13 <simonjb> that Vagrantfile won\'t be fully working unfortunately even with this fix and it has other issues: https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2620
2017-09-26T21:36:33 <Bosmon> simonjb - oh wow
2017-09-26T21:36:40 * alanharn_ has quit
2017-09-26T21:37:14 <Bosmon> simonjb - why does CI continue to run, in the face of this issue?
2017-09-26T21:37:48 <simonjb> this Vagrantfile is not widely used and isn\'t (I believe) used by CI
2017-09-26T21:39:22 <simonjb> it makes a VM containing \'production\' configurations of Cloud Based Flow Manager, Preferences server, and a CouchDB instance
2017-09-26T21:39:32 <simonjb> Cindy made it
2017-09-26T21:39:38 <simonjb> https://github.com/GPII/universal/tree/master/vagrant-configs
2017-09-26T21:40:08 <simonjb> I wanted to use it to do a little manual testing of GPII-2435 and then discovered that it wasn\'t operational
2017-09-26T21:41:31 <simonjb> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/documentation/ProductionSetupInstructions.md
2017-09-26T21:44:27 <Bosmon> simonjb - that\'s interesting
2017-09-26T21:44:33 <Bosmon> Isn\'t this what is used in our "end to end testing"?
2017-09-26T21:44:40 <Bosmon> Or have such things not yet got into CI yet?
2017-09-26T21:45:21 <simonjb> Bosmon: good question, I don\'t know -- maybe something to bring up at the arch meeting tomorrow?
2017-09-26T21:45:35 <Bosmon> simonjb - yes, sounds very relevant
2017-09-26T21:45:46 <Bosmon> I know alfredo asked about something similar about 3 weeks ago
2017-09-26T21:45:57 <Bosmon> And since then I merged the pull of kasparnet\'s that this was waiting on
2017-09-26T21:49:49 * michelled has quit
2017-09-26T21:51:44 <simonjb> Bosmon: actually I think it might have been Avtar that made this Vagrantfile, I don\'t know the history
2017-09-26T21:52:30 <simonjb> but it might be worth chatting about at tomorrow\'s meeting to see how it\'s being used and if there are other VMs that are being used instead in CI for similar purpose

b'2017-09-26T16:32:15 <cindyli> gtirloni: if the production VM has been handled, we probably should remove the one under /vagrant-configs
2017-09-26T16:33:08 <gtirloni> is the /vagrant-configs dir used for development? or just for running tests? right now the container workflow isn\'t very friendly to active development (container gets builds, tests run and everything is deleted afterwards)
2017-09-26T16:34:48 <cindyli> gtirloni: not just for running tests. it spins up flow manager and prefs server as separate node servers and back up with couchdb
2017-09-26T16:35:20 <gtirloni> got it, maybe we should fix it then
2017-09-26T16:35:29 <cindyli> was reading vagrantCloudBasedContainers.sh. it sets up couchdb for prefs server but didn\'t set up auth database
2017-09-26T16:35:34 * clown joined the channel
2017-09-26T16:35:40 <gtirloni> it\'s not used in production or CI anymore because it\'s too heavyweight.. so we\'re not using ansible for those tasks anymore
2017-09-26T16:36:18 <gtirloni> if CI should setup auth database, that process needs to be improved, if that\'s a requirement
2017-09-26T16:36:18 * clown has quit
2017-09-26T16:36:23 <cindyli> ok. i see. if so, we probably should keep vagrant-configs
2017-09-26T16:36:40 <cindyli> i will create jira
2017-09-26T16:36:55 <cindyli> for fixing ansible roles used by vagrant-configs
2017-09-26T16:37:14 * clown joined the channel
2017-09-26T16:38:10 <gtirloni> thanks
2017-09-26T16:53:51 <cindyli> simonjb: shall we create another jira for the problem you hit with starting "vagrant-configs" VM on windows 10
2017-09-26T17:03:22 * Jess_ joined the channel
2017-09-26T17:04:59 <mrtyler> gpii cloud demo part 2 is starting now in Room 2
2017-09-26T17:07:04 * kasparnet joined the channel
2017-09-26T17:07:20 <simonjb> yes cindyli, we can file a jira
2017-09-26T17:08:43 <simonjb> I\'m wondering also if we should and some more description to https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/vagrant-configs/README.md
2017-09-26T17:09:22 <simonjb> am I right in thinking that this VM is to run a "production" mode VM for local development?
2017-09-26T17:09:32 <simonjb> it\'s not actually for production deployment, right?
2017-09-26T17:14:32 <cindyli> "the production deployment", do you mean if the same steps would be used for deploying production?
2017-09-26T17:14:33 <cindyli> no
2017-09-26T17:15:56 <simonjb> cindyli: I mean that the VM would be deployed on the public internet
2017-09-26T17:16:18 <gtirloni> the usage in GPII of the term "production" is confusing but it\'s not really production... maybe there should be a different term for what\'s proposed
2017-09-26T17:16:31 <cindyli> i don\'t know, simonjb, but my guess is no
2017-09-26T17:17:25 <simonjb> we have production mode kettle configurations which would be used when we deploy publicly
2017-09-26T17:18:12 <simonjb> and this VM packages in one VM GPII projects running in production configuration, right?
2017-09-26T17:18:29 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-09-26T17:18:48 <simonjb> this is what we mean my production in the context on the VM we are discussing?
2017-09-26T17:19:19 <simonjb> this is what we mean my production in the context _of_ the VM we are discussing?
2017-09-26T17:23:10 <simonjb> cindyli: how much work do you think it\'ll be to fix the VM? is this something we could do today or is it a bigger job? I can look into the Windows 10 issue
2017-09-26T17:23:26 <simonjb> gtirloni: do you have any suggestions for the issue I\'m seeing on Windows 10?
2017-09-26T17:23:38 <cindyli> simonjb, gtirloni: i\'ve created a jira describing the issues i hit: https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2620
2017-09-26T17:23:51 <cindyli> simonjb: i think this should be addressed as a separate issue
2017-09-26T17:24:02 <gtirloni> simonjb: i haven\'t been able to test that, sorry... still download the latest box here
2017-09-26T17:24:03 <cindyli> all errors i hit was due to the change to other ansible repos
2017-09-26T17:24:49 <simonjb> I\'ll file a jira for the Windows 10 issue now
2017-09-26T17:25:11 <gtirloni> maybe tell npm not to use symlinks, because those don\'t exist in vbox shared folders
2017-09-26T17:25:17 <cindyli> simonjb: "separate issue" i mean outside of the GPII-2435 scope
2017-09-26T17:25:33 <gtirloni> maybe @amatas has some ideas, based on the work he did with masking dirs behind drive letters
2017-09-26T17:25:56 * alanharnum has quit
2017-09-26T17:25:59 <simonjb> cindyli: yes, agree, makes sense to separate from GPII-2435
2017-09-26T17:26:46 <simonjb> cindyli: I\'d like to run your code against a real CouchDB though, would you be able to help me with that?
2017-09-26T17:27:09 <cindyli> simonjb: do you have couchdb installed?
2017-09-26T17:27:18 <simonjb> cindyli: not yet
2017-09-26T17:27:50 <simonjb> cindyli: do you have a recommended way to run it?
2017-09-26T17:28:38 <cindyli> the easiest way is to use this VM, otherwise, we may have to set it up locally.
2017-09-26T17:29:14 <simonjb> yes, using this VM would be great :)
2017-09-26T17:29:43 <simonjb> that\'s why I asked if we could fix it today
2017-09-26T17:30:04 <simonjb> otherwise I can install and run locally
2017-09-26T17:30:32 <cindyli> the hard part using this VM is to fix the issue you had
2017-09-26T17:30:47 <cindyli> i should be able to get around errors I hit
2017-09-26T17:30:58 <simonjb> I\'ll reproduce the Windows 10 issue with the VM now and file a JIRA
2017-09-26T17:31:11 <simonjb> let\'s start with that
2017-09-26T17:45:11 <cindyli> simonjb: i\'m leaving for a conference soon. I\'m thinking tomorrow I will see if i can get this VM up at least on my machine. if successful, we can test GPII-2435 together on my machine at least. what do you think?
2017-09-26T17:46:15 <simonjb> sure cindyli, chat tomorrow
2017-09-26T17:46:27 <cindyli> cool
2017-09-26T17:57:11 <simonjb> gtirloni: I\'ve filed https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2621

2017-09-26T18:11:10 <simonjb> the error I\'m seeing looks like it\'s when making a bin link
2017-09-26T18:11:44 <gtirloni> yep, i think that\'s what avtar discovered and we started using it on linux (before the split node_modules solution was in place)

2017-09-26T18:30:16 <simonjb> looking to see how to increase...
2017-09-26T18:32:09 <gtirloni> npm3 usually has a lots of bugs like that.. i never found a workaround
2017-09-26T18:32:15 <gtirloni> i wonder how all of this was working in the past
2017-09-26T18:32:18 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-09-26T18:32:38 <simonjb> gtirloni: it\'s possible that it never worked on Windows
2017-09-26T18:33:08 * michelled joined the channel
2017-09-26T18:33:12 <simonjb> maybe we can use yarn?
2017-09-26T18:34:59 <gtirloni> it seems there are some issues with compiling native extensions that we use with yarn. Bosmon faced some issues which i coulnd\'t reproduce on Linux because my platform (OS+bitness) matched some pre-compiled package and I was lucky.. I don\'t know if that has changed lately

2017-09-26T18:41:22 <simonjb> ha indeed!
2017-09-26T18:50:23 <simonjb> gtirloni: so I guess that we need to update universal/vagrant-configs/Vagrantfile to use the same approach as universal/Vagrantfile so that it will work on a Windows host
2017-09-26T18:50:33 <simonjb> who is the person best able to do that?
2017-09-26T18:51:10 * michelled has quit
2017-09-26T18:52:16 <gtirloni> good point, that should work. I can submit a PR for that
2017-09-26T18:52:53 <simonjb> ok, awesome, thanks gtirloni
2017-09-26T18:54:10 <simonjb> gtirloni: can I assign https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2621 to you then?

2017-09-26T21:13:26 <Bosmon> simonjb - could you give me a brief potted summary of what this node_modules separation business is about? : P
2017-09-26T21:13:44 <Bosmon> I\'ve read the materials I can find but can\'t say I fully grasp it
2017-09-26T21:16:31 * alanharnum has quit
2017-09-26T21:16:57 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-09-26T21:17:22 <simonjb> Bosmon: when we do an npm install inside a Linux VM on a VirtualBox shared folder we hit issues regarding use of symbolic links -- such as https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2621
2017-09-26T21:18:30 <simonjb> the node_modules separation fix causes the node_modules directory to be mounted from the guest (Linux) filesystem
2017-09-26T21:19:07 <simonjb> so rather than a directory in a shared folder, its a native filesystem directory
2017-09-26T21:19:16 <simonjb> and symbolic links work successfully
2017-09-26T21:19:49 <simonjb> we still use a virtual box shared folder to access the source code
2017-09-26T21:20:02 <simonjb> but the node_modules exists on the guest filesystem
2017-09-26T21:20:17 <simonjb> and is mounted as a child of the shared folder
2017-09-26T21:20:54 <simonjb> it also has the advantage that any natively compiled code is isolated
2017-09-26T21:21:14 <simonjb> the guest and host node_modules are separate

2017-09-26T21:29:21 <Bosmon> It explains why I\'ve never observed it since I\'ve been unable to fire up Linux vagrant boxes for quite a while
2017-09-26T21:29:29 <Bosmon> Through causes unknown
2017-09-26T21:29:40 <simonjb> Bosmon: I should have asked, but I\'m assumming this is for https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/555 ?

2017-09-26T14:55:49 <cindyli> "vagrant up" finishes and i hit a different error
2017-09-26T14:55:49 <cindyli> cp: cannot stat \xe2\x80\x98/home/vagrant/sync/gpii/node_modules/preferencesServer/configs/gpii.config.preferencesServer.standalone.production.json\xe2\x80\x99: No such file or directory
2017-09-26T14:56:02 <cindyli> seems it looks up the config file from a wrong folder
2017-09-26T14:56:04 * alanharnum has quit
2017-09-26T14:56:11 <cindyli> looking up where this path is defined
2017-09-26T14:56:20 <cindyli> might be in an ansible repo
2017-09-26T14:56:30 <cindyli> simonjb: when did you hit the error?
2017-09-26T14:56:30 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-09-26T14:56:50 <cindyli> is it at the very beginning of the provisioning or down below?
2017-09-26T14:58:12 <simonjb> it\'s an npm install, I think
2017-09-26T14:58:30 <simonjb> https://gist.github.com/simonbates/354f176f325104613bb25218e3a89de3
2017-09-26T14:58:40 <simonjb> cindyli ^
2017-09-26T14:59:03 <cindyli> right

2017-09-26T15:06:41 <simonjb> gtirloni: do you think that you might be able to help us with some of your Windows npm symlink magic skills? I am getting an error when doing vagrant up on https://github.com/cindyli/universal/blob/GPII-2435/vagrant-configs/Vagrantfile
2017-09-26T15:06:49 <simonjb> on Windows 10 host
2017-09-26T15:06:58 <simonjb> I get this error from npm install
2017-09-26T15:07:09 <simonjb> https://gist.github.com/simonbates/354f176f325104613bb25218e3a89de3
2017-09-26T15:08:24 <gtirloni> sure, let me try to reproduce this in a moment
2017-09-26T15:08:38 <simonjb> thanks very much gtirloni

2017-09-26T15:43:33 <cindyli> thanks, simonjb. regarding the error you hit, i was thinking there are 2 things we could try:
2017-09-26T15:43:52 <cindyli> 1. make sure GPII is not running on your host machine, so /node_modules is not in use
2017-09-26T15:44:46 <cindyli> 2. remove /node_modules from your host machine completely since the VM is using a different VM so it likely needs to populate a different /node_modules
2017-09-26T15:45:26 <simonjb> cindyli: good suggestions, but I believe that I did those already
2017-09-26T15:45:33 <cindyli> ah ok
2017-09-26T15:45:35 <cindyli> :(
2017-09-26T15:45:51 <simonjb> I did a git clean before running vagrant up
2017-09-26T15:46:31 <simonjb> (git clean -dix)
2017-09-26T15:50:13 * kasparnet has quit
2017-09-26T15:56:26 <gtirloni> simonjb cindyli: what version of vbox are you using?
2017-09-26T15:56:49 <cindyli> 5.1.14
2017-09-26T15:57:05 <cindyli> the latest is 5.1.28. shall i upgrade, gtirloni
2017-09-26T15:57:36 <gtirloni> I have been using that for a while now but I have not tested win10 yet with it.. no problems with centos/fedora boxes for me at least
2017-09-26T15:59:19 <simonjb> gtirloni: 5.1.28
2017-09-26T15:59:48 <gtirloni> ok. yeah, i wouldn\'t expect a newer version to fix that... lately vbox has been pretty stale
2017-09-26T16:01:52 * jessm joined the channel
2017-09-26T16:10:56 <cindyli> gtirloni: i\'m hitting the error of "\'preferences_server_data_loader_port\' is undefined" when using https://github.com/gpii-ops/ansible-preferences-server-data-loader
2017-09-26T16:11:20 <cindyli> it seems in deploy.yml, a wrong variable name is used
2017-09-26T16:11:31 <cindyli> at https://github.com/gpii-ops/ansible-preferences-server-data-loader/blob/master/tasks/deploy.yml#L3
2017-09-26T16:11:53 <cindyli> shall "preferences_server_data_loader_port" be "preferences_server_data_loader_couchdb_host_port"
2017-09-26T16:12:17 <cindyli> by looking at main.yml - https://github.com/gpii-ops/ansible-preferences-server-data-loader/blob/master/defaults/main.yml#L5
2017-09-26T16:13:26 <cindyli> another issue is with "ansible-preferences-server" repo
2017-09-26T16:14:12 <cindyli> I believe we talked about before and decided the gpii config files should always be read from gpii/configs folder
2017-09-26T16:14:19 * michelled joined the channel
2017-09-26T16:14:33 <cindyli> so, these 2 lines might need to be changed - https://github.com/gpii-ops/ansible-preferences-server/blob/master/defaults/main.yml#L6-L7
2017-09-26T16:15:28 <cindyli> to
2017-09-26T16:15:29 <cindyli> preferences_server_environment: gpii.config.preferencesServer.standalone.production
2017-09-26T16:15:29 <cindyli> preferences_server_config_dir: gpii/configs
2017-09-26T16:16:22 <cindyli> the 2nd issue is trivial since those 2 environment variables can be overridden in Vagrantfile
2017-09-26T16:17:59 <cindyli> but i cannot get around the first issue with modifying vagrant files (due to my lack of knowledge with vagrant and ansible) ;)
2017-09-26T16:22:18 <gtirloni> cindyli: please add `preferences_server_data_loader_couchdb_host_port: 5984`
2017-09-26T16:22:48 <cindyli> but the deploy script is using "preferences_server_data_loader_port"
2017-09-26T16:22:53 <cindyli> a different variable
2017-09-26T16:23:03 <cindyli> which would still be undefined
2017-09-26T16:24:50 <gtirloni> these are the variables needed: https://github.com/gpii-ops/ansible-preferences-server-data-loader/blob/master/defaults/main.yml
2017-09-26T16:25:26 <cindyli> gtirloni: but deploy.yml is using a different var - https://github.com/gpii-ops/ansible-preferences-server-data-loader/blob/master/tasks/deploy.yml#L3
2017-09-26T16:25:26 * clown1 joined the channel
2017-09-26T16:25:35 * clown has quit
2017-09-26T16:25:39 <cindyli> search for {{ preferences_server_data_loader_port }}
2017-09-26T16:25:53 <cindyli> this var name should be changed to "preferences_server_data_loader_couchdb_host_port"
2017-09-26T16:26:08 <gtirloni> got it
2017-09-26T16:26:13 <gtirloni> what project are you working on?
2017-09-26T16:26:22 <cindyli> there are other lines with the wrong var name
2017-09-26T16:26:37 <cindyli> working on https://github.com/GPII/universal/tree/master/vagrant-configs
2017-09-26T16:26:46 <cindyli> this VM spins up a GPII production env
2017-09-26T16:27:04 <cindyli> hitting various errors due to the ansible change
2017-09-26T16:29:11 <gtirloni> i see
2017-09-26T16:29:24 <gtirloni> the role is deprecated and we\'ve moved on to using containers
2017-09-26T16:29:33 <cindyli> ok
2017-09-26T16:29:34 <gtirloni> i would need some time to retrofit those changes
2017-09-26T16:29:54 <gtirloni> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/package.json#L79
2017-09-26T16:30:08 <gtirloni> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/scripts/vagrantCloudBasedContainers.sh
2017-09-26T16:30:12 <gtirloni> this is what is being used by CI
2017-09-26T16:30:42 <gtirloni> could you open a JIRA for that issue? I can try to fix those errors. right now i don\'t remember anymore how they work together
