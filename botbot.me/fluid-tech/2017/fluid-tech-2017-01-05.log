2017-01-05T15:37:18 <simonjb> hi cindyli I was wondering if you might be able to help me with an infusion component design question?
2017-01-05T15:37:47 <cindyli> love to hear, simonjb
2017-01-05T15:39:08 <simonjb> I have a component that is configured with a set, or list, of other components and I\'m wondering (a) where to put them ("components", "model") and (b) how to instantiate (if not using "components")
2017-01-05T15:39:18 <simonjb> let me paste some code...
2017-01-05T15:40:51 <simonjb> cindyli: https://gist.github.com/simonbates/784d0b85f33c9ef18b0da4f1e239817e
2017-01-05T15:41:37 <simonjb> this is basic stuff that I feel like I should know but am having trouble with
2017-01-05T15:42:42 <cindyli> simonjb: when do those components need to be instantiated?
2017-01-05T15:43:05 <simonjb> when the parent is instantiated
2017-01-05T15:44:03 <simonjb> should they just go into "components"?
2017-01-05T15:44:31 <cindyli> simonjb: is it because those components could be dynamically added or instantiated after the parent is instantiated, so you are thinking to place them into "model"?
2017-01-05T15:44:51 <simonjb> yes, exactly
2017-01-05T15:44:52 <cindyli> if those components are a fixed set, the use of "components" should be good enough
2017-01-05T15:45:24 <simonjb> the set could be added to after the parent has been constructed
2017-01-05T15:45:29 <cindyli> so, when a component is dynamically added, do you want it to be instantiated right away?
2017-01-05T15:45:39 <simonjb> yes
2017-01-05T15:45:41 <cindyli> ok
2017-01-05T15:45:55 <cindyli> thinking...
2017-01-05T15:46:43 <alanharnum> is this possibly an appropriate use case for the dynamic subcomponents features, cindyli?
2017-01-05T15:47:01 * kasparnet has quit
2017-01-05T15:47:26 <cindyli> alanharnum: also thinking od dynamic components. but i think it might require the knowing of what those subcomponents are
2017-01-05T15:50:22 <cindyli> simonjb, alanharnum: yes, dynamic components look promising. simonjb, u probably can simply use an option on the parent component - https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/tests/framework-tests/core/js/FluidIoCTests.js#L3313
2017-01-05T15:50:47 <cindyli> no, u cannot use an option because it\'s not modifiable when the parent is instantiated
2017-01-05T15:50:53 <cindyli> u will have to use model
2017-01-05T15:51:54 <cindyli> simonjb: could give it a try to modify that test component on the line 3313 to listen on a model value
2017-01-05T15:53:34 <alanharnum> you can also create dynamicComponents when a particular event fires
2017-01-05T15:53:58 <alanharnum> that might be appropriate to simonjb\'s use case
2017-01-05T15:54:57 <cindyli> alanharnum: needs to be careful with not re-instantiating those previously instantiated subcomponents
2017-01-05T15:55:26 <alanharnum> cindyli yeah i\'ve had challenges with that in the past
2017-01-05T15:56:11 <alanharnum> i\'m not sure i\'m understanding exactly what simonjb needs to do, but it sounds like it\'s around attaching subcomponents to the the parent component after the parent component has been created, which says dynamicComponents might be a potential answer
2017-01-05T15:56:31 <alanharnum> but they can be complex and i\'d avoid using them unless definitely necessary
2017-01-05T15:57:11 <alanharnum> not that i necessarily know what "definitely necessary" means here :p
2017-01-05T15:57:30 <simonjb> thanks cindyli and alanharnum but I\'m thinking that dynamicComponents might not work for me -- I think I want to have arbitrary types in my set
2017-01-05T15:57:51 <cindyli> what those arbitrary types could be?
2017-01-05T15:57:58 <simonjb> and it looks like with dynamicComponents, one specifies a single type
2017-01-05T15:57:59 <cindyli> aren\'t they all infusion components?
2017-01-05T15:58:17 <simonjb> yes, for sure -- all infusion components
2017-01-05T15:58:22 <alanharnum> simonjb: i think (I am talking way outside my area here) you can do a kind of polymorphism using dynamicComponents
2017-01-05T15:58:33 <cindyli> ah i see, u mean dynamicComponents only allows one same type of a infusion component
2017-01-05T15:58:36 <cindyli> let me check
2017-01-05T15:58:51 <simonjb> http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/SubcomponentDeclaration.html#dynamic-components
2017-01-05T16:00:27 <simonjb> okay, if I specified something generic in the type
2017-01-05T16:00:39 <simonjb> I could put the specific gradeNames in the options array
2017-01-05T16:01:48 <cindyli> right, simonjb
2017-01-05T16:02:06 <alanharnum> I believe you can also use an IoC reference in "type"
2017-01-05T16:02:19 <alanharnum> so you can actually pass in something like "{arguments}.0"
2017-01-05T16:02:34 <alanharnum> and have the type specified by the firing event
2017-01-05T16:02:40 <cindyli> simonjb: u could change this line https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/tests/framework-tests/core/js/FluidIoCTests.js#L3316 from using "source" option to "gradeNames" option
2017-01-05T16:03:17 <simonjb> this is all super-helpful, thanks both
2017-01-05T16:03:28 <cindyli> anytime :)
2017-01-05T16:03:43 <simonjb> if I was to stick with using the model, what\'s the best way to instantiate the child components?
2017-01-05T16:03:45 <alanharnum> WARNING, horrible prototype code: https://github.com/waharnum/learningDashboard/blob/master/src/js/page.js#L18
2017-01-05T16:03:59 <simonjb> https://gist.github.com/simonbates/784d0b85f33c9ef18b0da4f1e239817e#file-gistfile1-txt-L5
2017-01-05T16:04:17 <simonjb> cindyli: ^
2017-01-05T16:04:17 <alanharnum> you can see an example of using IoC references to event arguments to determine a component type at runtime
2017-01-05T16:04:25 <simonjb> thanks alanharnum
2017-01-05T16:05:10 <alanharnum> and here\'s where the event gets fired, passing in the displayComponentType: https://github.com/waharnum/learningDashboard/blob/master/src/js/page.js#L101
2017-01-05T16:06:22 <alanharnum> that all works fine to let you nest arbitrary and different components under a single dynamicComponents key
2017-01-05T16:06:29 <alanharnum> though it may not be the smartest approach :)
2017-01-05T16:07:28 <cindyli> alanharnum: the issue with this approach is, if all dynamic subcomponents have the definition of - createOnEvent: "onEntryRetrieved", the additions of later subcomponents could trigger the recreation of previously instantiated subcomponents
2017-01-05T16:08:29 <cindyli> simonjb: the child component u meant is like "gpii.tests.nexus.recipeA" in ur gist code?
2017-01-05T16:08:39 <cindyli> or subcomponents of gpii.tests.nexus.recipeA?
2017-01-05T16:09:22 <cindyli> if it\'s gpii.tests.nexus.recipeA, when you modify receipes[], the dynamicComponents block will instantiate it
2017-01-05T16:09:32 <alanharnum> cindyli: yeah, i think that is one specific issue i ran into, which meant I had to end up managing some things manually, which defeats some of the value
2017-01-05T16:10:32 <cindyli> but it seems like receipes[] array cannot be used to keep track of all receipes, otherwise, it might cause the same issue of "triggering the recreation of previously instantiated subcomponents"
2017-01-05T16:10:53 <alanharnum> http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/SubcomponentDeclaration.html#naming-of-dynamic-components
2017-01-05T16:11:08 <cindyli> simonjb: u may need to use a model value like "newRecipes"
