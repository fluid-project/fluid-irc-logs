b'2017-02-09T17:15:40 <mrtyler> but idk who does the actual starting
2017-02-09T17:15:46 <mrtyler> and i\'m not sure exactly how to dig in and debug
2017-02-09T17:17:41 <gtirloni> let me try a few things here, one sec
2017-02-09T17:18:56 <mrtyler> take your time :) i banged my head against this for a few hours the other night
2017-02-09T17:19:23 <mrtyler> molecule is cool tho so i think it\'s worth the trouble
2017-02-09T17:19:49 <mrtyler> it found a bunch of problems in the collectd role *before i wrote a single test*
2017-02-09T17:19:59 <mrtyler> just because it runs playbooks (and a linter)
2017-02-09T17:20:36 <alanharnum> i would be quite happy if Molecule eases the process of playbook development
2017-02-09T17:20:45 <alanharnum> because as-is I end up kluding together things like https://github.com/waharnum/ansible-development-template
2017-02-09T17:21:51 <mrtyler> alanharnum: yup, i think molecule does what you want out of the box (you get one vm instead of a fleet of vms but i\'m not actually sure why you want a fleet of vms for local testing?)
2017-02-09T17:22:12 <mrtyler> alanharnum: you are free to clone the repos i linked and play around with \'molecule test\' to see what it does (or tries to do)
2017-02-09T17:22:15 <alanharnum> i think the answer is mostly "because i can"
2017-02-09T17:22:41 <alanharnum> and I wanted to be able to do things like "configure this VM as a database server, and this one as an application that connects to it", etc
2017-02-09T17:22:44 <mrtyler> then why stop at 3? why not 10? why not 100? why not a wall of virtual machines?!
2017-02-09T17:23:03 <mrtyler> and the host machines will pay for them
2017-02-09T17:26:20 <alanharnum> <insert Pink Floyd joke>
2017-02-09T17:28:10 <gloob> what\'s molecule?
2017-02-09T17:28:35 <mrtyler> gloob: http://molecule.readthedocs.io/en/stable-1.19/
2017-02-09T17:28:42 <gloob> oic, a testing framework for ansible
2017-02-09T17:28:56 <gloob> mrtyler: yes, but I prefer the warmer conversation with an human
2017-02-09T17:28:57 <gloob> sometimes
2017-02-09T17:29:16 <mrtyler> gloob: then software development might not be the right career for you ;)
2017-02-09T17:29:47 <gloob> mrtyler: but we are talking right?
2017-02-09T17:30:02 <gloob> mrtyler: are you real? who are you?
2017-02-09T17:30:17 <mrtyler> gloob: i\'m an eggdrop bot
2017-02-09T17:30:30 <gloob> mrtyler: help
2017-02-09T17:30:49 <mrtyler> gloob: here is the contents of my help file:
2017-02-09T17:30:52 <mrtyler> 
2017-02-09T17:31:03 <gloob> mrtyler: banner Hi everyone
2017-02-09T17:31:24 <mrtyler> gloob: Hi: Bad command or file name
2017-02-09T17:31:42 <gloob> ok, so molecule
2017-02-09T17:31:48 <gloob> let me see that examples
2017-02-09T17:32:22 <gloob> so you pass this https://github.com/mrtyler/ansible-collectd
2017-02-09T17:32:25 <gloob> and ok?
2017-02-09T17:32:37 <gloob> ah, you need a .molecule.yml
2017-02-09T17:32:43 <gloob> without dot
2017-02-09T17:32:48 <mrtyler> yes that\'s the one i\'m asking gio for help on
2017-02-09T17:32:54 <gloob> and it\'s done
2017-02-09T17:32:56 <mrtyler> but it runs enough to give you an idea
2017-02-09T17:33:10 <gtirloni> mrtyler: the influxdb role is able to start the service because the influxdb package provides a sysV-type script, which ansible\'s service module can understand. the collectd package only provides a systemd unit file, which needs the systemd daemon to be running... and ansible\'s service module fails
2017-02-09T17:33:50 <mrtyler> gtirloni: ok neat. where is the sysv init script? cuz it\'s not the one i posted about before -- that looks decidedly non-sysv
2017-02-09T17:33:56 <gtirloni> ./etc/init.d/influxdb comes from that init.sh file
2017-02-09T17:34:03 <mrtyler> oh
2017-02-09T17:34:29 <mrtyler> is there an rpm postinstall or something that adds it to /etc ?
2017-02-09T17:34:34 <mrtyler> i guess there must be
2017-02-09T17:34:39 <gtirloni> probably
2017-02-09T17:34:50 <gtirloni> rpm -qp --scripts package.rpm will show it
2017-02-09T17:35:56 <mrtyler> ugh, it needs the actual rpm file?
2017-02-09T17:36:03 <mrtyler> let me go find that
2017-02-09T17:36:05 <mrtyler> anyway
2017-02-09T17:36:11 <mrtyler> how do you think we should proceed?
2017-02-09T17:36:24 <mrtyler> can i just add a dumb sysv-init (via ansible) and use that for testing?
2017-02-09T17:36:52 <mrtyler> is this going to be a big problem for our ansible roles and we\'ll end up having to repeat that strategy everywhere we want to use molecule?
2017-02-09T17:37:32 <mrtyler> we could look into improving molecule->docker->systemd relations, but that seems like a tough road
2017-02-09T17:38:00 <mrtyler> we could try using vagrant instead of docker. i don\'t like this since it\'s soooo much slower (and when i tried it, i encountered a different error and gave up)
2017-02-09T17:38:05 <gtirloni> it seems people start systemd inside the container just for the test -- https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2016/how-i-test-ansible-configuration-on-7-different-oses-docker
2017-02-09T17:38:13 <gtirloni> i prefer docker too
2017-02-09T17:38:13 <mrtyler> but maybe it\'s more reliable
2017-02-09T17:42:12 <mrtyler> gtirloni: ok let me explore running systemd inside the container
2017-02-09T17:42:45 <mrtyler> i *really* don\'t like that setup in general since it misses the point of docker, but in this case (where docker is a stand-in for a real server, as jeff notes in the blog) i guess it\'s more reasonable
2017-02-09T17:42:55 <gtirloni> yeah, i agree
2017-02-09T17:43:08 <mrtyler> ok thanks for your help gio
2017-02-09T17:43:12 <gtirloni> yw!!
2017-02-09T17:43:40 <mrtyler> i\'m *hoping* this is the last big hurdle and i can post some PRs later today
2017-02-09T17:44:29 <mrtyler> hypothetically, what do you think of the "dumb sysv init script for testing only" idea?
2017-02-09T17:45:04 <mrtyler> esp since the init script is really just a smoke test -- can this service be started even after you mucked with all the config files
2017-02-09T17:45:20 <mrtyler> i don\'t really care to verify that ansible and systemd do the right thing re: service stop/start commands
2017-02-09T17:47:15 <mrtyler> hypothetical 2: assuming i get systemd working with the collectd role, should i also get systemd working with the influxdb role (i.e. not rely on it accidentally including a legacy sysvinit script in its package)
2017-02-09T17:49:08 <gtirloni> yeah, i think it\'s reasonable to expect that the integration between ansible/systemd is reliable at this point. if you can start collectd in the same way the systemd service would (with the same parameters) by using a dumb sysv-type init script you just drop in /etc/init.d, that should be fine to validate the rest of the functionality
2017-02-09T17:50:05 <gtirloni> in case #2, influxdb supplies both sysv and systemd services, so systemd should work fine too (it does, since we\'re using it in i-0023)
2017-02-09T17:51:01 <gtirloni> we were lucky (or unlucky, maybe) that ansible\'s service module tries to support a bunch of different init systems :)
2017-02-09T17:51:18 <gtirloni> can you change which centos image molecule uses ?
2017-02-09T17:51:33 <mrtyler> gtirloni: right, i know influxdb works in production. i\'m just thinking of wehther it\' useful to have consistency between roles, i.e. all roles are tested the same way
2017-02-09T17:51:45 <gtirloni> i think it\'s useful
2017-02-09T17:51:49 <mrtyler> gtirloni: yes. molecule.yml
2017-02-09T17:52:15 <gtirloni> https://hub.docker.com/r/centos/systemd/
2017-02-09T17:52:17 <gtirloni> maybe this will work
2017-02-09T17:52:38 <mrtyler> interesting!
2017-02-09T17:52:52 <mrtyler> ok to summarize
2017-02-09T17:53:25 <mrtyler> 1. try to get collectd role working with systemd
2017-02-09T17:53:52 <mrtyler> 2. if that works, to keep things consistent amongst our roles, i\'ll try to get influxdb working the same way
2017-02-09T17:54:13 <mrtyler> 3. if it doesn\'t work, i\'ll write a dumb sysvinit script to at least get us past this problem right now. we can re-evaluate later.
2017-02-09T17:55:02 <gtirloni> sounds like a plan!
2017-02-09T17:55:06 <mrtyler> cool
2017-02-09T17:55:15 <mrtyler> thx again. i\'ll update you when... i have an update :)
2017-02-09T17:55:55 <gtirloni> btw, the influxdb role should probably have a "enable influxdb" task, because influxdb is getting start by chance.. because the "restart influxdb" handler gets notified when the config file changes (in case it doesn\'t change, in production, influxdb could be in stopped state)..
2017-02-09T17:56:26 <mrtyler> gtirloni: good point. i\'ve made a note.
2017-02-09T17:56:28 <gtirloni> cool, thx for working on this.. this role testing stuff is great
2017-02-09T17:56:32 <jhernandez> gloob: hst is IN
2017-02-09T17:56:57 <mrtyler> gtirloni: yeah i was so excited about it and then this little hiccup kind of destroyed my faith in humanity :3
2017-02-09T17:57:04 <mrtyler> but yeah, i think this will be a good thing in the long run
2017-02-09T17:57:09 <mrtyler> worth the trouble (at least for now)
2017-02-09T17:57:43 <mrtyler> another pro: you were able to repro my error in like 5 minutes with basically no setup
2017-02-09T17:57:50 <mrtyler> that kind of thing has definite value
2017-02-09T17:57:53 <jhernandez> michelled stegru: I\'ve just pushed gloob\'s HST branch into gpii-app/hst-2017
2017-02-09T17:57:55 <gtirloni> yep, that was cool too
2017-02-09T17:57:58 <jhernandez> JFYI
2017-02-09T17:58:00 <gtirloni> :)
2017-02-09T17:58:15 <michelled> thx for the heads up jhernandez

2017-02-09T18:06:21 <jhernandez> gotta run now, see you tomorrow guys
2017-02-09T18:07:55 <gloob> adios
2017-02-09T18:13:59 <mrtyler> btw gio we were right; there\'s a postinstall script:
2017-02-09T18:14:00 <mrtyler> function install_systemd {
2017-02-09T18:14:00 <mrtyler> cp -f $SCRIPT_DIR/influxdb.service /lib/systemd/system/influxdb.service
2017-02-09T18:14:00 <mrtyler> systemctl enable influxdb
2017-02-09T18:14:01 <mrtyler> }
2017-02-09T18:14:37 <mrtyler> but uh... that means systectl enable is running inside the container when the package gets installed (with no reported error)
2017-02-09T18:14:42 <mrtyler> so not sure what\'s up with that
2017-02-09T18:14:46 <mrtyler> doesn\'t change the plan tho :)
2017-02-09T18:15:18 <mrtyler> btw it ALSO does update-rc.d and chkconfig
2017-02-09T18:16:14 <mrtyler> oh wait i\'m dumb, it falls back to chkconfig if systemctl isn\'t installed
2017-02-09T18:16:33 <mrtyler> ok this definitely explains why influxdb works in the container then

2017-02-09T15:12:35 <gloob> jhernandez: I checked here and all is working fine so far
2017-02-09T15:12:40 <gloob> jhernandez: double check is welcome
2017-02-09T15:16:01 <jhernandez> gloob: is not welcome, IT IS REQUIRED
2017-02-09T15:16:03 <jhernandez> :P
2017-02-09T15:16:44 <jhernandez> mrtyler: I think you are pinging JJ, not me ?
2017-02-09T15:17:14 <mrtyler> jhernandez: whoops! sorry
2017-02-09T15:17:33 <mrtyler> i guess he\'s not here
2017-02-09T15:18:25 <jhernandez> hehe, no prob
2017-02-09T15:25:37 <michelled> gloob - if you edit the https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/pull/2 pull request, you can change the base branch so it will be communicated on the pull request which branch you want it to land in
2017-02-09T15:31:27 <gloob> michelled: yes, but the problem is that gpii/gpii-app:HST doesn\'t exists yet and should be created from this PR and this PR keeps open for including in master too
2017-02-09T15:31:54 <gloob> or that\'s what, it seems, we were doing with the "soft branches" before
2017-02-09T15:33:24 <michelled> I thought the interface allowed me to specify a branch that didn\'t exist yet\xe2\x80\xa6. I guess I didn\'t go through the entire process.

2017-02-09T15:34:11 <michelled> gloob: I didn\'t realize you were hoping to land that in master. Can you put a comment on it to make it clear what you expect to change or improve before it lands?
2017-02-09T15:34:23 <michelled> that would be awesome to have that work making it\'s way to master!

2017-02-09T15:37:42 <jhernandez> michelled: yes, this is what I\'m trying to do, to drive Ale to document as much as we can during his work on this
2017-02-09T15:37:51 <jhernandez> this way we all win
2017-02-09T15:38:18 <gloob> I will bomb all the PRs afterwards potentially

2017-02-09T16:44:22 <gtirloni> mrtyler: sure
2017-02-09T16:45:35 <mrtyler> gtirloni: ok great
2017-02-09T16:45:58 <mrtyler> i am trying to get the collectd role up and running with molecule
2017-02-09T16:46:09 <mrtyler> (i need collectd for influxdb, which is how i got here)
2017-02-09T16:46:41 <mrtyler> molecule spins up a docker container and runs ansible rules against that container
2017-02-09T16:46:50 <gtirloni> ok
2017-02-09T16:46:54 <mrtyler> this worked swimmingly for influxdb
2017-02-09T16:47:11 <mrtyler> but i\'m having trouble with collectd and/or systemd
2017-02-09T16:47:22 <mrtyler> someone is unable to start collectd inside the container
2017-02-09T16:47:32 <mrtyler> let\'s see if i can get you a repro case
2017-02-09T16:47:39 <mrtyler> can you clone this? git@github.com:mrtyler/ansible-collectd
2017-02-09T16:47:47 <gtirloni> let me try
2017-02-09T16:47:53 <mrtyler> and then do you have a working virtualenv?

2017-02-09T16:48:16 <mrtyler> s/local machine/machine where you do work/
2017-02-09T16:49:05 <gtirloni> yep
2017-02-09T16:49:17 <gtirloni> but i think this role should fail inside a container because it messes around with selinux and systemd
2017-02-09T16:50:02 <gtirloni> it should probably skip selinux/systemd tasks
2017-02-09T16:50:29 <mrtyler> selinux is already skipped
2017-02-09T16:50:55 <mrtyler> when: collectd_selinux_permissive and ansible_selinux and ansible_selinux.status != \'disabled\'
2017-02-09T16:50:59 <gtirloni> cool
2017-02-09T16:51:10 <mrtyler> (i had to add the middle clause -- an error caught thanks to molecule! :))
2017-02-09T16:51:21 <mrtyler> systemd might be weird BUT
2017-02-09T16:51:29 <mrtyler> this same approach appears to work fine with influxdb
2017-02-09T16:51:54 <mrtyler> i.e. ansible seems able to run influxdb in a container, using the same ansible service: stanza
2017-02-09T16:52:11 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-02-09T16:52:25 <mrtyler> one thing i notice is that the influxdb package includes: /usr/lib/influxdb/scripts/init.sh
2017-02-09T16:52:31 <mrtyler> while collectd has no similar entity
2017-02-09T16:52:32 <gtirloni> interesting, i\'d expect it to complain that systemd socket is not available
2017-02-09T16:53:31 <mrtyler> i can get you to a repro case for influxdb as well, if you wwant to see that work
2017-02-09T16:54:13 <mrtyler> git@github.com:mrtyler/ansible-role-influxdb but it needs a small change or it will fail in a different way (it needs collectd, which i can\'t provide because i\'m stuck on this other problem for collectd :))
2017-02-09T16:55:14 <gtirloni> ok, let me try molecule with both here
2017-02-09T16:55:36 <mrtyler> ok i can walk you through venv setup or you can install system packages if you prefer
2017-02-09T16:56:01 <mrtyler> check requirements.txt for all the packages you\'ll need, if doing it system-level / by hand
2017-02-09T16:56:41 <gtirloni> ok
2017-02-09T16:56:52 <alanharnum> i highly recommend venv if you\'re doing Python stuff
2017-02-09T16:56:57 <mrtyler> me2
2017-02-09T16:57:08 <alanharnum> very straightforward, hugely valuable
2017-02-09T16:57:13 * alanharnum loves venv
2017-02-09T16:57:14 <mrtyler> but this is just a one off
2017-02-09T16:57:28 <alanharnum> yeah if just a one off may not be needed
2017-02-09T16:57:40 * kasparnet has quit
2017-02-09T16:57:47 * alanharnum was just installing scrapy last night for some stuff and was reminded how smooth the venv experience is
2017-02-09T16:58:16 <mrtyler> alanharnum: fun fact: i actually tried to do system packages for this task using macports. it failed in like a million ways, the last straw being that the macports flake8 package is simply broken and will not run as installed
2017-02-09T16:58:27 <gtirloni> i usually use venv when i\'m coding in python, but for these utilities that i\'m going to use all the time, from everywhere, i just go with the system packages
2017-02-09T16:58:55 <gtirloni> ok, got the same error here. checking it out now...
2017-02-09T16:58:55 <mrtyler> alanharnum: oh, and this was after macports didn\'t have molecule at all, which lead to "sudo pip install"
2017-02-09T16:58:59 <alanharnum> mrtyler: I\'m a homebrew > macports user myself
2017-02-09T16:59:07 <alanharnum> so cannot comment
2017-02-09T16:59:18 <alanharnum> not as in I think brew is necessarily better, but i have literally never used macports
2017-02-09T16:59:24 <mrtyler> alanharnum: yes. several of my friends said the same thing. i think it\'s probably time to move but i didn\'t want to drop my ansible work to do it
2017-02-09T17:00:27 <mrtyler> gtirloni: so you made it to "fatal: [ansible-collectd]: FAILED! => {"changed": false, "failed": true, "msg": "no service or tool found for: collectd"}"
2017-02-09T17:00:30 <mrtyler> ?
2017-02-09T17:00:40 <gtirloni> TASK [ansible-collectd : Enable systemd service] *******************************
2017-02-09T17:00:40 <gtirloni> fatal: [ansible-collectd]: FAILED! => {"changed": false, "failed": true, "msg": "Could not find the requested service collectd: cannot enable"}
2017-02-09T17:01:00 <mrtyler> ah ok you have the version where i set use=systemd in the service: stanza
2017-02-09T17:01:05 <mrtyler> which, as you see, also fails
2017-02-09T17:01:22 <mrtyler> you can comment it out in tasks/deploy.yml to get the error i posted
2017-02-09T17:01:27 <gtirloni> ok
2017-02-09T17:01:49 <mrtyler> btw i also made the collectd deploy.yml look exactely like the influxdb deploy.yml
2017-02-09T17:01:51 * the-t-in-rtf joined the channel
2017-02-09T17:02:07 <mrtyler> i.e. state: restarted instead of state: started, and comment out enabled: yes
2017-02-09T17:02:13 <mrtyler> didn\'t change anything :(
2017-02-09T17:06:59 <gtirloni> yeah, i think that task must be skipped... avtar created a role a while ago called \'facts\' (https://github.com/idi-ops/ansible-facts/blob/master/tasks/always.yml#L34-L44) that added some complementary variables so the \'when\' clause would read better... (\'when: not is_docker\')
2017-02-09T17:07:04 <gtirloni> https://ybin.me/p/d1a8e8ac8a72ea04#ab9JNX7MeCkkXIolS7NAFzB+jlw2lP8QDOpQHx9+vmg=
2017-02-09T17:08:10 <mrtyler> yeah the d-bus error is super annoying because it makes it hard to investigate what systemd inside the container thinks it\'s doing
2017-02-09T17:08:31 <mrtyler> i found some workarounds for that (--run-privileged and a bunch of other crap i guess) but i haven\'t tried to do them yet
2017-02-09T17:08:48 <mrtyler> re: skipping these tasks: i think that seriously blunts the usefulness of testing
2017-02-09T17:08:49 <gtirloni> now, why influxdb doesn\'t have this problem... did you get further than this? https://ybin.me/p/d92d6e1b68a68d47#RZDPZED+HgaK/ZVDSRsT8wG3at3FKQG/DqDcn9FL9tA=
2017-02-09T17:08:57 <mrtyler> and maybe makes molecule worthless
2017-02-09T17:09:14 * javjarfer has quit
2017-02-09T17:09:21 <mrtyler> so i definitely don\'t want to do that
2017-02-09T17:09:26 <mrtyler> plus, as discussed, influxdb appears to work fine
2017-02-09T17:09:39 <mrtyler> making things actually work would be better, i\'m pretty sure ;)
2017-02-09T17:10:12 <mrtyler> gtirloni: re: influxdb: yes, comment out everything (or at least the top stanza) from tasks/configure.yml
2017-02-09T17:10:20 <gtirloni> i think it\'s because this role considers itself to be living in a systemd world.. for running inside a container, it either would delegate starting ccollectd to docker itself or setup supervisor. can molecule run collectd by itself maybe?
2017-02-09T17:10:44 <mrtyler> molecule doesn\'t (shouldn\'t) really do anything on its own. it runs ansible code
2017-02-09T17:11:03 <mrtyler> gtirloni: influxdb also considers itself to be "living in a systemd world" afaict?
2017-02-09T17:12:02 <gtirloni> i don\'t see systemd referenced in the influxdb role, so i think not
2017-02-09T17:12:16 <mrtyler> where do you see it referenced in collectd?
2017-02-09T17:12:36 <gtirloni> the package certainly install the required files if you were to use the systemd unit, but unless you actively try to enable the \'influxdb\' unit and start it.. it\'s just sitting dormant
2017-02-09T17:12:52 <mrtyler> gtirloni: it runs in the container that molecule starts
2017-02-09T17:12:59 <gtirloni> here: https://github.com/mrtyler/ansible-collectd/blob/master/tasks/deploy.yml#L3-L8
2017-02-09T17:13:07 <mrtyler> molecule login -> ps auxwf and you will see it
2017-02-09T17:13:27 <mrtyler> gtirloni: i added use: systemd as an attempt at a workaround. it did not work
2017-02-09T17:13:50 <mrtyler> gtirloni: you wrote the comment that mentions systemd. you are a smart guy but that line is only a comment :)
2017-02-09T17:14:04 <mrtyler> any other references?
2017-02-09T17:14:13 <gtirloni> i think i don\'t understand who is starting the \'influxdb\' process then
2017-02-09T17:14:32 <mrtyler> i agree it\'s hard to suss out with all the layers
2017-02-09T17:14:34 <gtirloni> what comment?
2017-02-09T17:14:40 <mrtyler> - name: Enable systemd service
2017-02-09T17:14:47 <mrtyler> i guess that\'s not a comment
2017-02-09T17:14:49 <gtirloni> it\'s not commented :)
2017-02-09T17:15:05 <mrtyler> the point is that it is arbitrary text that does not inform collectd\'s architecture
2017-02-09T17:15:30 <mrtyler> it *should* be that ansible is causing influxdb to run
2017-02-09T17:15:36 <mrtyler> actually it *must* be that

2017-02-09T10:47:50 <the-t-in-rtf> I usually assume that anyone surprisingly online before 15:00 CET is actually someone\'s pet walking on the keyboard.

2017-02-09T12:52:37 <stegru> hiya
2017-02-09T12:53:11 <stegru> gloob: i was wondering how stable your provisioning scripts where
2017-02-09T12:55:40 <stegru> I started a new box while I went for lunch, so I thought I\'d try your latest scripts
2017-02-09T12:56:32 <gloob> stegru: I\'m jsut fixing a minor problem
2017-02-09T12:56:48 <jhernandez> stegru: he\'s fixing a chicken-egg problem
2017-02-09T12:56:51 <gloob> I think we will have a somehow-stable provisioning gpii-app in minutes
2017-02-09T12:57:00 <stegru> ah ok
2017-02-09T12:57:13 <jhernandez> yes, I was in the middle of trying everything together
2017-02-09T12:58:35 <stegru> mine failed just after updating chrome - i was using the "windows" repo
2017-02-09T12:59:09 <jhernandez> stegru: I\'ve just ran vagrant up in windows and went okay
2017-02-09T13:00:24 <jhernandez> what error are you gettting?
2017-02-09T13:00:29 <stegru> yes, I don\'t think it was the provisioning script that broke
2017-02-09T13:01:11 <stegru> http://pastebin.com/vzLjWXXX
2017-02-09T13:01:53 <jhernandez> I\'ve never seen this before
2017-02-09T13:01:58 <jhernandez> weird
2017-02-09T13:02:42 <stegru> i was using windows master, but copied gloob\'s provisioning directory from his HST branch
2017-02-09T13:02:51 <jhernandez> the thing is that the upgrade finished well and right after that it says "Forcing shutdown" ...
2017-02-09T13:04:26 <jhernandez> stegru, gloob\'s hst is merged in windows/hst-2017 already
2017-02-09T13:04:54 <jhernandez> you can use that branch instead if you want to

2017-02-09T13:08:04 <stegru> oh jhernandez, what version of virtualbox are you using, on linux?
2017-02-09T13:10:04 <jhernandez> stegru: 5.0.18_SUSE r106667
2017-02-09T13:10:22 <jhernandez> it\'s a bit out of date but it works for me
2017-02-09T13:11:03 <stegru> yes, i\'ve been having problems with 5.1 - i\'m back on 5.0.32 and it\'s been ok
2017-02-09T13:11:20 <jhernandez> oh really? what kind of problems?
2017-02-09T13:11:54 <stegru> windows would crash after a few minutes - it wouldn\'t provision
2017-02-09T13:12:14 <jhernandez> mmm
2017-02-09T13:12:32 <jhernandez> does it say that vagrant couldn\'t connect to the box or something similar?
2017-02-09T13:12:57 <stegru> no, windows just crashed
2017-02-09T13:13:01 <jhernandez> okok
2017-02-09T13:13:03 <stegru> blue screen
2017-02-09T13:13:06 <jhernandez> no idea then

2017-02-09T13:23:15 <jhernandez> sweet
2017-02-09T13:23:50 <stegru> gloob: , do you think it would be a good idea to make the provisioning scripts print out the commands as they\'re executed? if it fails then we know what line

2017-02-09T13:37:27 <gloob> you know that you change a file
2017-02-09T13:37:33 <gloob> it\'s under git
2017-02-09T13:37:39 <gloob> and you retrieve another file from internet
2017-02-09T13:37:41 <gloob> with the same name
2017-02-09T13:37:44 <stegru> yes?
2017-02-09T13:37:47 <stegru> i\'ve done that
2017-02-09T13:37:48 <gloob> and destroy all your changes?
2017-02-09T13:37:58 <stegru> oh?
2017-02-09T13:38:11 <gloob> Build.ps1 everywhere xD
2017-02-09T13:38:53 <gloob> OH MAN
2017-02-09T13:38:55 <gloob> I commited it
2017-02-09T13:38:57 <gloob> thanks god
2017-02-09T13:40:42 <stegru> did you know about the "previous versions" feature of windows?
2017-02-09T13:44:29 <gloob> no
2017-02-09T13:44:34 <gloob> how is that
2017-02-09T13:47:05 <stegru> if you right-click on a directory, there\'s something like "previous versions"
2017-02-09T13:47:51 <gloob> interesting
2017-02-09T13:48:08 <stegru> it saved my life a few times
2017-02-09T13:48:27 <gloob> although I\'m in a uncharted space, it\'s the vagrant directory linked with vagrant black magic to the osx guest directory where I was actually editing
2017-02-09T13:49:16 <stegru> thought you where still on windows
2017-02-09T13:49:17 <gloob> oh Restore PRevious version
2017-02-09T13:49:24 <gloob> interesting, yes
2017-02-09T13:49:30 <gloob> from where is this here?
2017-02-09T13:49:37 <gloob> how much levels of restoring you can do?
2017-02-09T13:49:58 <stegru> i don\'t know - i think the older files just go when space is required
2017-02-09T13:50:10 <gloob> stegru: interesting features, thanks
