2017-04-18T18:12:40 <kasparnet> Bosmon: I\'m starting to doubt the sanity of our decision to remove start, configure, etc blocks
2017-04-18T18:13:03 <kasparnet> ... mostly because I suddenly remembered one of the C4A solutions using a special flag when updating
2017-04-18T18:13:31 <kasparnet> a parameter to the .exe file or something
2017-04-18T18:13:54 <kasparnet> and I guess we\'d be unable to handle this without explicit directives
2017-04-18T18:18:49 <kasparnet> it\'d be awkward to express no matter how we do the format

2017-04-18T18:46:01 <kasparnet> Bosmon: I captured some of our earlier discussion here: https://pad.gpii.net/mypads/?/mypads/group/technical-discussions-4g920a3/pad/view/2016-09-06-canopy-work-remaining-5sb4nkz
2017-04-18T18:46:18 <kasparnet> and wrote down the issue that I was blabbing about above down to line 13
2017-04-18T18:46:25 <Bosmon> kasparnet - a SPECIAL FLAG?
2017-04-18T18:46:26 <kasparnet> with a potential solution on line 14
2017-04-18T18:46:42 <kasparnet> Bosmon: yes
2017-04-18T18:46:51 <kasparnet> like "nvda.exe /u"
2017-04-18T18:48:12 <Bosmon> What is on line 14?
2017-04-18T18:48:27 <Bosmon> A blank line?
2017-04-18T18:48:39 <Bosmon> A truly INGENIOUS SOLLUTION, Her KASPARDWITT!
2017-04-18T18:48:53 <kasparnet> haha, thank you
2017-04-18T18:49:08 <kasparnet> yet another sneaky trick from the kasparnet
2017-04-18T18:50:34 <Bosmon> This surely is your sneakiest yet
2017-04-18T18:50:44 <Bosmon> Encoding your potential solution as a blank line
2017-04-18T18:52:05 <Bosmon> You should submit your system to those https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSFuck guys
2017-04-18T18:52:15 <Bosmon> It hugely exceeds anything they have been capable of :)
2017-04-18T18:52:49 <Bosmon> Did you know that undefined could be encoded as [][[]] ? : P
2017-04-18T18:54:33 <kasparnet> hahaha, that\'s absolutely insane
2017-04-18T18:57:34 <Bosmon> Which in turn looks like why it is possible to give the letter "d" such a "compact" encoding: ([][[]]+[])[!+[]+!+[]]
2017-04-18T18:58:45 <kasparnet> here is the potential solution encoded in JSfuck: https://pastebin.com/ZufjG1W2
2017-04-18T18:58:56 <kasparnet> it\'s pretty fascinating that it\'s possible
2017-04-18T19:01:38 <Bosmon> I can\'t get it to decode in any of the encoders I found : P
2017-04-18T19:01:50 <kasparnet> hmm.. sec
2017-04-18T19:04:27 <kasparnet> hmmm... odd, I cant get the decoders working on it either
2017-04-18T19:04:49 <Bosmon> Well, it\'s just as ingenious as your encoding then
2017-04-18T19:04:56 <kasparnet> haha
2017-04-18T19:05:02 <Bosmon> In that it is equally impossible to get back the material which was originally encoded : P
2017-04-18T19:05:17 <kasparnet> hahahaha
2017-04-18T19:07:03 <kasparnet> https://pastebin.com/qPMp369E
2017-04-18T19:07:21 <kasparnet> should run it in your browsers console for the best effect
2017-04-18T19:07:57 <kasparnet> (which isn\'t particularly impressive... it mostly just crashes your browser and overheats the CPU if everything goes according to plan)
2017-04-18T19:08:02 <Bosmon> hahahaha
2017-04-18T19:08:29 <Bosmon> It\'s possible
2017-04-18T19:08:34 <Bosmon> But wrong
2017-04-18T19:08:53 <Bosmon> The behaviour of a settings handler when receiving settings which match the currents state must always be to do nothing
2017-04-18T19:09:08 <Bosmon> So, nice try at completely burning to the ground our settings handler idiom : P
2017-04-18T19:09:10 <Bosmon> Also ingenious
2017-04-18T19:09:27 <kasparnet> thank you
