2017-02-24T14:29:54 <the-t-in-rtf> So, if (like me), you've ever been in a situation where you wanted to collect code coverage but were spawning child processes, apparently there is now a tool that does that.

2017-02-24T14:30:37 <the-t-in-rtf> I assume it overrides child_process somehow, but the upshot is it works when istanbul alone won't

2017-02-24T14:32:36 <the-t-in-rtf> I was relieved to have found it, as I was not happy to be submitting a tool that promises to help promote the use code coverage without being able to report on its own code coverage somehow.

2017-02-24T14:34:28 <the-t-in-rtf> Anyway, that was the last hurdle to overcome before submitting the new gpii-testem library for review.
2017-02-24T14:34:41 <the-t-in-rtf> Just tidying up and reworking the docs before creating the PR.
