2017-04-20T15:02:19 <amatas> gtirloni: do you know if there is any problem with the connection to the IDRC datacenter?
2017-04-20T15:02:39 <amatas> I\'m uploading a file to i-0026 at 70K/s
2017-04-20T15:06:13 <gtirloni> we have not been notified of issues.. i can upload from here at 100-110K/s constant, but that as high as my xDSL uplink will go so I can\'t tell

2017-04-20T15:08:57 <amatas> perhaps we have routing problems between canada-spain
2017-04-20T15:19:10 <gtirloni> it seems okay here, i\'m getting zero packet loss.. does `mtr 205.211.169.10` tell you anything?

2017-04-20T15:27:17 <amatas> nothing odd
2017-04-20T15:27:30 <amatas> about 150ms of latency
2017-04-20T15:28:07 <amatas> but a simply scp goes very slow
2017-04-20T15:30:14 <avtar> fluid-everyone: if you\'re using a windows host to run vagrant you\'ll want to skip the 1.9.3 release https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/issues/8395 vagrant up fails with a "The requested address is not valid in its context. - connect(2) for "0.0.0.0" port" error
2017-04-20T15:30:55 <avtar> there are workarounds listed in the issue thread linked above but it\'s easier to stick with the 1.9.2 release or wait for the upcoming 1.9.4 one

2017-04-20T15:55:22 <alanharnum> cindyli: I updated the sub-task I made for the floeproject site at https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLOE-505 with some information about what I\'ve done
2017-04-20T15:55:31 <alanharnum> do you want to chat about it quickly?
2017-04-20T15:55:38 <cindyli> sure, alanharnum. vidyo?
