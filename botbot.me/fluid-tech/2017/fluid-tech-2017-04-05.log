2017-04-05T15:52:25 <the-t-in-rtf> Has anyone already starting "require"-ing JSON5 files from within node?
2017-04-05T15:52:37 <the-t-in-rtf> I saw in the meeting minutes a while back a mention of this library: https://github.com/json5/json5
2017-04-05T15:53:01 <the-t-in-rtf> I also see this one, which does something very similar in making node\'s require work with JSON5 files: https://github.com/duzun/require-json5
2017-04-05T15:53:08 <the-t-in-rtf> Just wondering if anyone had experience with either.
