2017-11-13T19:08:02 <clown> amatas::  dumb newby question:  does our windows vm for GPII come with Visual Studio installed?
2017-11-13T19:13:34 <clown> avtar, do you know ^ ?
2017-11-13T19:16:27 <gtirloni> *i think* we only install the VS build tools, not the full IDE
2017-11-13T19:26:31 <clown> gtirloni:  thanks.  If it try to start VS, it gives an error, and then offers me to update, so I\'m trying that.  It might be that i will install the full IDE.
2017-11-13T19:27:13 <gtirloni> i hope the 60GiB disk is enough
2017-11-13T19:29:24 <clown> so do I, gtirloni.  before starting the install, I check the VM settings and it said that 22gig were in use.  I guess I\'ll find out "the hard way".
2017-11-13T20:15:05 <avtar> clown: sorry, just noticed your ping now :/
2017-11-13T20:15:25 <avtar> basically what gtirloni said, only the build tools are included
2017-11-13T20:15:26 <clown> no problem.  good morning, avtar!  :-)
2017-11-13T20:16:32 <avtar> you may want to download the visual studio installer on your mac first
2017-11-13T20:16:47 <avtar> in case the vm craps out with storage errors
2017-11-13T20:18:58 <clown> avtari, okay.  that might be faster since it\'s been about half an hour installing from withing the windows VM and it\'s only at about 17%.
2017-11-13T20:19:07 <clown> whoops, I mean avtar
2017-11-13T20:19:49 <clown> BTW I\'m installing the community edition since it\'s noted as "free".  Is that the correct edition (if you know)?
2017-11-13T20:21:05 <avtar> yup that\'s the edition you\'re looking for
2017-11-13T20:22:29 <clown> cool, thanks avtar \xe2\x80\x94 off hand to you have the link for the installer that I download to the mac?
2017-11-13T20:22:40 <clown> If not, I\'ll figure it out.
2017-11-13T20:22:49 <avtar> sorry, not sure about that
2017-11-13T20:26:00 <clown> I think it\'s this:  does it look familiar to you:  https://www.visualstudio.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community&rel=15#
2017-11-13T20:48:32 <avtar> doesn\'t look familiar but that seems like a safe bet
2017-11-13T21:03:56 <clown> hey avtar, I downloaded that .exe installer, copied to to the VM, and launched it.  It\'s be sitting there for half an hour at 0%.  It\'s like it\'s not doing anything.  Any ideas?
2017-11-13T21:06:20 <avtar> is this a new vm or the one where you were previously installing visual studio?
2017-11-13T21:10:08 <avtar> hmm looks like that installer linked above is 1 meg in size
2017-11-13T21:10:23 <avtar> so it\'s probably still trying to download bits before the installation begins
2017-11-13T21:10:37 <avtar> i\'m assuming you\'re hitting a sluggish mirror

2017-11-13T21:13:39 <avtar> this seems like a weird way of providing an offline installer rather than just provide an iso

2017-11-13T21:30:35 <clown> thanka avtar
2017-11-13T21:30:39 <clown> *thanks
2017-11-13T21:31:12 <clown> I think I may have been installing too much, and, with simonjb\'s help, changed the selections.  It\'s going much faster, but still kind of slow.
2017-11-13T21:51:51 * gloob has quit
2017-11-13T21:53:50 <clown> simonjb:  it\'s finished the installation and I\'ve launched the IDE.  So far, so good.  Thanks for you help.
