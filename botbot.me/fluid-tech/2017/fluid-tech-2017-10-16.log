2017-10-16T13:59:29 <the-t-in-rtf1> @Bosmon, you now how we commonly use code like "var fluid = fluid || require("infusion")"?
2017-10-16T13:59:42 <the-t-in-rtf1> Is there an equivalent pattern for fluid.require?
2017-10-16T13:59:59 <the-t-in-rtf1> I am writing a cross-environment component and would prefer to use fluid.require on the node side.
2017-10-16T14:03:34 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-10-16T14:06:17 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf1 - well, one can\'t use fluid to require itself ....
2017-10-16T14:06:22 <Bosmon> So I\'m not sure what could help
2017-10-16T14:07:21 <the-t-in-rtf1> I mean, to require another package
2017-10-16T14:07:32 <the-t-in-rtf1> so, fluid.require("my-package"), but only on the node side.
2017-10-16T14:07:42 <the-t-in-rtf1> I understand about not requiring fluid itself through fluid... ;)
2017-10-16T14:08:01 <the-t-in-rtf1> fluid.require("%my-package"), you get the idea
2017-10-16T14:10:39 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf1 - still not quite sure what the exact question is, but perhaps you are meaning some code like this: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/settingsHandlers/src/settingsHandlerUtilities.js#L19
2017-10-16T14:11:07 <the-t-in-rtf1> ah, yes, that\'s a more generally useful pattern
2017-10-16T14:11:20 <the-t-in-rtf1> I just want something other than having to check for the presence of a global variable.
2017-10-16T14:11:32 <the-t-in-rtf1> thanks, @Bosmon
2017-10-16T14:12:04 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf1 - well, this *is* the checking for the presence of a global variable : P
2017-10-16T14:12:43 <the-t-in-rtf1> ha, yes, but one that is always known
