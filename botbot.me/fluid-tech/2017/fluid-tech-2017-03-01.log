2017-03-01T15:12:57 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - this failure is interestingly different from ones we have had before
2017-03-01T15:13:21 <Bosmon> As you can see from the details of the error message:
2017-03-01T15:13:22 <Bosmon> 15:12:23.880:  ASSERTION FAILED: Error loading infusion - infusion has already been loaded from the path
2017-03-01T15:13:23 <Bosmon> E:\\source\\gits\\infusion-master
2017-03-01T15:13:23 <Bosmon> - please delete the duplicate copy which is found at
2017-03-01T15:13:23 <Bosmon> E:\\source\\gits\\infusion-master\
ode_modules\\infusion\\src\\module
2017-03-01T15:14:04 <the-t-in-rtf> I did try deleting that copy, BTW
2017-03-01T15:14:11 <Bosmon> There is no "copy" there
2017-03-01T15:14:11 <the-t-in-rtf> let me find the error\xe2\x80\xa6
2017-03-01T15:14:25 <Bosmon> Oh I see
2017-03-01T15:14:30 <Bosmon> There is
2017-03-01T15:14:31 <Bosmon> How funny
2017-03-01T15:14:50 <Bosmon> This is a case I never dreamed of
2017-03-01T15:15:04 <Bosmon> An instance of infusion with another instance of infusion as a direct dependency
2017-03-01T15:16:14 <Bosmon> Well, if gpii-testem were fixed up to use fluid.require("infusion") at line 3 of index.js, *AND* the extra copy of infusion were deleted, we\'d get away with it
2017-03-01T15:16:30 <Bosmon> But this is inadequate, given that every package manager will decide to put it there
2017-03-01T15:16:34 <Bosmon> What a bizarre case
2017-03-01T15:16:45 <Bosmon> I mean, fluid.require("%infusion")
2017-03-01T15:17:03 <Bosmon> But of course how would it have loaded infusion
2017-03-01T15:17:07 <Bosmon> If it were just requiring it
2017-03-01T15:17:09 <Bosmon> How hilarious
2017-03-01T15:21:57 <Bosmon> Looks like yarn is still bugged in some ways
2017-03-01T15:22:05 <Bosmon> I deleted the extra infusion, but "yarn install" will not put it back
2017-03-01T15:23:34 <Bosmon> Actually npm install is just the same
2017-03-01T15:23:42 <Bosmon> I guess the package managers are almost as confused by this situation as we are
2017-03-01T15:23:50 <Bosmon> Oh no wait
2017-03-01T15:23:53 <Bosmon> npm install did put it back
2017-03-01T15:27:44 <the-t-in-rtf> but how can fluid.require("infusion") ever work?
2017-03-01T15:27:59 <the-t-in-rtf> I mean, there\'s no fluid to require infusion.

2017-03-01T15:31:01 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - yes, this is what I meant
2017-03-01T15:31:07 <Bosmon> I am just trying to patch the issue now
2017-03-01T15:31:29 <the-t-in-rtf> thanks.
2017-03-01T15:31:46 <Bosmon> Although my brain is bending a bit
2017-03-01T15:31:47 <the-t-in-rtf> If you and @cindyli are OK with what I proposed, I can much more easily make the same change to universal in the mean time.
2017-03-01T15:32:00 <Bosmon> It was hard enough to think of the original approach for auto-deduping
2017-03-01T15:33:05 <Bosmon> It might be easier to axe all of this fragile code and do all of this by fluid.module.preInspect
2017-03-01T15:33:55 <Bosmon> Well
2017-03-01T15:34:09 <Bosmon> Yes
2017-03-01T15:34:12 <Bosmon> In fact we must do that
2017-03-01T15:34:31 <Bosmon> Because the top-level infusion module is *NEVER* considered loadable by the standard node module loader
2017-03-01T15:34:41 <Bosmon> It is only visible to the "preInspect" system
2017-03-01T15:34:52 <Bosmon> ok, this will clear the thicket out a bit
2017-03-01T15:34:57 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - what was what you proposed?
2017-03-01T15:35:20 <Bosmon> I think cindyli was a little confused yesterday in that she interpreted your proposal as planning to get rid of vagrant
2017-03-01T15:35:48 <cindyli> right, Bosmon helped to clarify
2017-03-01T15:37:25 <the-t-in-rtf> Sorry, I proposed using gpii-testem to add cross-environment test coverage to universal.
2017-03-01T15:37:43 <Bosmon> Oh yes
2017-03-01T15:37:46 <Bosmon> Sounds brilliant
2017-03-01T15:38:25 <the-t-in-rtf> It should be a 15 minute process at this point, I figured out most of it with gpii-pouchdb.
2017-03-01T15:39:26 <Bosmon> Running our tests itself seems like a 15 minute process at this point.... given all the long timeouts that we seem to have now
2017-03-01T15:39:33 <Bosmon> I was confused by this last night but I need to try to run again
2017-03-01T15:43:07 <the-t-in-rtf> Oh, I meant 15 minutes until I can push the work in progress off the edge of the cliff
2017-03-01T15:43:15 <the-t-in-rtf> I would go cook or something and come back to see how it went
2017-03-01T15:43:37 <the-t-in-rtf> it\'s a fine strategy for long-running tests
2017-03-01T15:43:48 <the-t-in-rtf> it\'s less good for plumbing

2017-03-01T13:55:18 <Bosmon> What does "npm ls infusion" show in your module tree?

2017-03-01T13:57:35 <Bosmon> But it is actually infusion itself at the top of the tree
2017-03-01T13:57:39 <Bosmon> Right
2017-03-01T13:57:41 <the-t-in-rtf> yes, sorry, that bit was indeed missing.

2017-03-01T13:58:37 <Bosmon> ok
2017-03-01T13:58:41 <Bosmon> This shouldn\'t necessarily be a problem
2017-03-01T13:58:50 <Bosmon> But I imagine we might be running into the same problem we had last month
2017-03-01T13:59:03 <Bosmon> Which is that the require is issued before the initialisation of the infusion module itself is complete
2017-03-01T13:59:09 <Bosmon> Could you check this into a branch for me to test out?
2017-03-01T13:59:29 <the-t-in-rtf> certainly, it\'s already in a branch in prep for submitting a PR
2017-03-01T13:59:31 <the-t-in-rtf> just a sec.

2017-03-01T14:03:56 <the-t-in-rtf> OK, to give you a bit to review, I\'m going to bike home before my afternoon meetings.
2017-03-01T14:04:02 <Bosmon> the-t-in-rtf - cheers
2017-03-01T14:04:25 <Bosmon> In another note, I hear rumours that yarn 0.20 solves our leveldown build problems
2017-03-01T14:04:34 <Bosmon> I don\'t know if you\'ve had a chance to try it out
2017-03-01T14:05:55 <the-t-in-rtf> yes
2017-03-01T14:06:01 <the-t-in-rtf> I was going to mention it in the meeting.
2017-03-01T14:06:32 <the-t-in-rtf> I follow the same ticket, I see people still reporting the problem, but for me it works.
