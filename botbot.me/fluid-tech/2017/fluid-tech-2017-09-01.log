2017-09-01T20:21:34 <cindyli> hi Bosmon, is there a common way in the universal repo for defining mock ajax responses for node tests? like what jquery mockjax does for browser tests?
2017-09-01T20:23:11 <Bosmon> cindyli - I guess you dont mean ajax, but simply an HTTP client
2017-09-01T20:23:18 <Bosmon> cindyli - you can write your own DataSource
2017-09-01T20:25:17 <cindyli> Bosmon: i\'m writing the first pass of the access requester, which will be used by the local flow manager to send requests to the cloud, /access_token endpoint, to get an access token
2017-09-01T20:25:46 <cindyli> writing unit tests for the access requester to make sure it handles different responses correctly
2017-09-01T20:26:30 <cindyli> i don\'t want to start a cloud gpii to give real responses at the moment. this will be covered later by the acceptance tests
2017-09-01T20:27:00 <cindyli> so, i\'d like to define some mock responses from /access_token endpoint
2017-09-01T20:27:48 <cindyli> to pretend the access requester have received a response in different forms
2017-09-01T20:28:53 <cindyli> is there a way to define those mock responses within node tests, Bosmon?
2017-09-01T20:28:58 <Bosmon> cindyli - see above
2017-09-01T20:30:06 <cindyli> Bosmon: write a dataSource that sends back the response?
2017-09-01T20:30:13 <Bosmon> cindyli - y
2017-09-01T20:30:41 <cindyli> is there an example, Bosmon?
2017-09-01T20:35:35 <Bosmon> cindyli - https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/preferencesServer/test/preferencesServerTests.js#L47
2017-09-01T20:37:53 <cindyli> genius! thanks, Bosmon
