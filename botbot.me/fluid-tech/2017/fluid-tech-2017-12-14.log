2017-12-14T16:30:58 <alanharnum> I\'d be curious to hear opinions on my comment here: https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/SJRK-32?focusedCommentId=37826&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-37826 - especially from those (Bosmon, colinclark, the-t-in-rtf, simonjb?) who are more knowledgeable about Kettle\'s whole ecosystem
2017-12-14T16:32:41 <alanharnum> basically, one of our SJRK projects being implemented with Kettle needs to handle a diversity of file uploads - I think the easiest way to handle this is by wrapping Multer in kettle.plainAsyncMiddleware, as we\'ve done for some other standard Express middleware
2017-12-14T16:32:53 <alanharnum> but want to ask if there\'s been prior art to this specific issue for Kettle, etc
2017-12-14T16:33:13 <Bosmon> alanharnum no, sounds good to me
2017-12-14T16:34:41 <colinclark> It looks like you already have some middlewareOptions-esque things in your implemetnation spike, alanharnum
2017-12-14T16:34:46 <colinclark> but you probably have that on your to do list
2017-12-14T16:34:53 <colinclark> It\'s interesting that your issue mentions the Uploader
2017-12-14T16:35:10 * alanharn_ has quit
2017-12-14T16:35:20 <colinclark> I don\'t see any reason why we shouldn\'t explore a bit of refactoring of the Uploader to suit this use case, alanharnum
2017-12-14T16:35:29 <colinclark> it would be a great thing
2017-12-14T16:35:49 <alanharnum> colinclark: forgive my ignorance of the uploader, but does it have any server-side components, or is it just a client-side component?
2017-12-14T16:36:01 <colinclark> It\'s just client-side
2017-12-14T16:36:12 <colinclark> exactly the sort of companion you need for your multer wrapper
2017-12-14T16:37:17 <alanharnum> ok, that\'s what i thought - yeah, we\'ll look into refactoring it and using it with the multer wrapper
2017-12-14T16:37:55 <colinclark> it\'s a bit of a beast now

2017-12-14T17:01:25 <colinclark> mrtyler, ussjoin, amatas: Do we have a venue for our meeting now?
2017-12-14T17:01:39 <ussjoin> colinclark Yes, it\'s Hangouts.
2017-12-14T17:01:43 <colinclark> hangouts!
2017-12-14T17:01:48 <mrtyler> colinclark: on the calendar invite
2017-12-14T17:01:50 <mrtyler> is the link
2017-12-14T17:01:50 <colinclark> ok
2017-12-14T17:02:27 <colinclark> "Firefox is ending support for plugins, so Hangouts won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to support video and phone calls in Firefox until Hangouts is updated to resolve the problem. Google is working on a solution that will be available as soon as possible."
2017-12-14T17:02:40 <colinclark> Are we really sure this is our conferencing tool of choice? ;)
2017-12-14T17:03:23 <ussjoin> I can\'t speak to what\'s wrong with Firefox.
2017-12-14T17:03:56 <colinclark> What\'s wrong with Firefox is Google
2017-12-14T17:04:31 <ussjoin> Not entirely sure that\'s true.
2017-12-14T17:04:35 <ussjoin> Nonetheless, will you be joining us?
2017-12-14T17:04:41 <colinclark> "Requesting to join the video call..."
2017-12-14T17:05:02 <ussjoin> Are you joining from your RtF account?
2017-12-14T17:05:18 <colinclark> why does my RTF account have anything to do with this?

2017-12-14T19:31:31 <alanharnum> Bosmon: following on from earlier questions - does the Kettle testing framework or other testing prior art have support for file uploads? (I believe the answer is no, but want to ask out loud)

2017-12-14T20:01:48 <alanharnum> Bosmon: OK - I\'m thinking it might make sense (parallel to the work we\'re going to do with multer) to add that utility to KettleTestUtils using something like https://www.npmjs.com/package/form-data
2017-12-14T20:01:50 <alanharnum> sound reasonable?
2017-12-14T20:02:26 <Bosmon> alanharnum - yes, looks good
