2017-03-08T12:42:57 <kasparnet> Bosmon, jhernandez: do either of you have any memory of us deciding to remove a ton of "update" entries in the solution registry
2017-03-08T12:43:14 <kasparnet> alternatively, they might never have been added...
2017-03-08T12:43:29 <kasparnet> but currently, I only see a couple of entries in linux.json5
2017-03-08T12:43:38 <kasparnet> which seems like a very low number
2017-03-08T12:45:18 <Bosmon> kasparnet - I think they were never added
2017-03-08T12:45:27 <Bosmon> Since our "update" functionality is utterly untested
2017-03-08T12:45:41 <kasparnet> Bosmon: yeah - except for unit tests
2017-03-08T12:45:54 <kasparnet> but I guess both my work and the soon-to-be-alive-again PCP will both need it
2017-03-08T12:46:07 <kasparnet> .... too many "both" in that sentence
2017-03-08T12:46:09 <Bosmon> The unit tests don\'t actually test anything
2017-03-08T12:46:15 <Bosmon> As the abusive comments next to them explains
2017-03-08T12:46:23 <kasparnet> haha

2017-03-08T13:34:24 <jhernandez> kasparnet, Bosmon: yes, "update" is not being used as far as I know
2017-03-08T13:35:21 <jhernandez> but yes, I guess that we will start using it at some point in the near future for the PCP
2017-03-08T13:49:26 <the-t-in-rtf> @Bosmon, here is an updated coverage report for infusion: http://the-t-in-rtf.github.io/infusion-coverage-20170308/index.html
2017-03-08T13:49:46 <the-t-in-rtf> I am researching a last connection abort and getting it working in Vagrant, but this is probably pretty close to the final result.
2017-03-08T13:50:29 <the-t-in-rtf> We\'re down from ~35 coverage reporting errors to 1 across all browsers, so more code is reported on this time.

2017-03-08T15:28:51 <cindyli> jhernandez: i\'m working on this jira - https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2324 for the web personalization using chrome extensions
2017-03-08T15:29:08 <cindyli> i wonder if this is the chrome extension i should experiment with - https://github.com/GutiX/chrome4cloud
2017-03-08T15:29:13 <cindyli> do you have an idea?
2017-03-08T15:29:29 <cindyli> also, r u the creator of this chrome extension?

2017-03-08T16:03:06 <cindyli> hi jhernandez: we can talk about it in the meeting then
2017-03-08T16:03:13 <jhernandez> I rewrote that extension, the new one is https://github.com/GPII/gpii-chrome-extension
2017-03-08T16:03:15 <jhernandez> yes
2017-03-08T16:03:56 <cindyli> jhernandez: so i should use this pull request https://github.com/GPII/gpii-chrome-extension/pull/1
2017-03-08T16:04:07 <jhernandez> yes
2017-03-08T16:05:12 <cindyli> ok
2017-03-08T16:05:36 <jhernandez> in any case, if you want, we can have a meeting so I can explain to you how the extension works internally and how I apply things to the webs

2017-03-08T16:57:32 <jhernandez> cindyli: here you can see how we apply highContrast https://github.com/javihernandez/gpii-chrome-extension/blob/3540d6d279cf72495f89b0ea9f05c1f018251da2/extension/src/lib/highContrast.js
2017-03-08T16:57:40 <cindyli> super. thanks, jhernandez
2017-03-08T17:00:13 <jhernandez> in this particular case, we have already injected new CSS into the webpage, so we make use of content scripts that apply the changes on the DOM
2017-03-08T17:00:55 <jhernandez> ie, to enable high contrast we execute this content script https://github.com/javihernandez/gpii-chrome-extension/blob/3540d6d279cf72495f89b0ea9f05c1f018251da2/extension/src/content_scripts/highContrastEnable.js
2017-03-08T17:04:02 <cindyli> thanks, jhernandez, will try this setting

2017-03-08T20:14:14 <gtirloni> Jess_: 20
2017-03-08T20:14:36 <Jess_> 20 concurrent connections?
2017-03-08T20:14:45 <gtirloni> yep
2017-03-08T20:15:09 <gtirloni> we can always increase that if needed, provided we have the bandwidth
2017-03-08T20:15:16 <gtirloni> (it\'s not a hard limit)
2017-03-08T20:15:25 <gtirloni> hardcoded, that is..
