2017-09-08T13:43:11 <gtirloni> does anyone know how to authorize an app in github without giving it access to *all orgs* that you belong to? I want to try some app and it needs full admin access, but I don\'t know to give that kind of access to, say, GPII/IDI orgs
2017-09-08T14:06:26 <gtirloni> looks like it\'s done on a per-org basis and it\'s allow=all by default
2017-09-08T14:06:27 <gtirloni> https://help.github.com/articles/disabling-oauth-app-access-restrictions-for-your-organization/
2017-09-08T14:07:26 <gtirloni> I think we should enable the "Third-party application restrictions" for our main orgs
2017-09-08T14:07:52 <gtirloni> then when someone that belongs to the org tries to authorize some app, it\'ll get queued in pending status until someone authorized it manually

2017-09-08T19:12:06 <colinclark> gtirloni, mrtyler: I\'ve updated the GPII wiki Licensing page with what we should be including at the root of each repository and in file headers\xe2\x80\x94there was a bit of drift between that wiki page and what was in the source code
2017-09-08T19:12:35 <mrtyler> thanks colinclark
2017-09-08T19:13:06 <colinclark> primarly the preface that Gio pointed out in his pull request comment, which isn\'t strictly necessary but was advised to us a decade ago on Fluid, just as a way clarifying that the top-level copyright statement was a general one, and can be refined by nested license files or the specific copyright attributions in the file headers itself

2017-09-08T19:14:18 <colinclark> Other projects do an AUTHORS file a generic copyright attribution (e.g. "Copyright the Authors of PROJECT"), but our open source lawyer at the time thought this was a good approach, and I don\'t think there\'s any reason to change until, well, there\'s a reason to change :)
2017-09-08T19:14:29 <colinclark> sorry it was a bit out of date and confusing
2017-09-08T19:16:25 <colinclark> one of these days we should normalize all our repos
2017-09-08T19:17:41 <mrtyler> i was gonna say, this policy definitely has not been applied universally
