2017-04-19T17:01:52 <avtar> basically tagging images with the output of `git rev-parse --short HEAD`
2017-04-19T17:02:22 <gtirloni> https://forums.docker.com/t/is-there-a-max-number-of-tags-that-i-can-push-to-docker-hub-registry/1760/2

2017-04-19T17:02:40 <gtirloni> we should probably \'garbage collect\' old tags
2017-04-19T17:03:24 * cindyli has quit
2017-04-19T17:03:30 <avtar> good catch
2017-04-19T17:04:21 <avtar> i guess even 90 tags would provide a fair bit of breathing room for going back in time to dust off an old preferences server image
2017-04-19T17:10:27 <gtirloni> avtar: agreed. it\'s less of a concern with a private docker registry too. and it\'s also fairly easy to rebuild locally, if one needs to troubleshoot something (git checkout; docker build)
2017-04-19T17:10:28 <gtirloni> mrtyler amatas: quick question, does the next sprint start on the day of the sprint retrospective? or today? or next monday?
2017-04-19T17:11:17 <amatas> I think that the sprint started the last monday
2017-04-19T17:12:17 <gtirloni> oh, i\'m already late :)
2017-04-19T17:13:32 <mrtyler> gtirloni: it looks like the way sandra is running it is:
2017-04-19T17:13:36 <mrtyler> friday: final standup
2017-04-19T17:13:40 <mrtyler> sunday: sprint ends
2017-04-19T17:13:43 <mrtyler> monday: no standup
2017-04-19T17:13:55 <mrtyler> monday: weekly meeting becomes retrospective -> planning for next sprint
2017-04-19T17:14:04 <mrtyler> so sprint starts monday as well
2017-04-19T17:16:26 <gtirloni> ok thx

2017-04-19T19:08:52 <mrtyler> they are pretty weird
2017-04-19T19:09:13 <mrtyler> two are "Failed to connect to the host via ssh: Shared connection to 127.0.0.1 closed."
2017-04-19T19:09:31 <mrtyler> during Add EPEL repository
2017-04-19T19:09:50 <mrtyler> the other is
2017-04-19T19:09:51 <mrtyler> Stderr: VBoxManage: error: Could not find a registered machine with UUID {643ba8c6-28cc-40a7-9654-84e69fffc650}

2017-04-19T19:10:21 <gtirloni> yeah, pretty weird, let me see
2017-04-19T19:11:10 <mrtyler> and obviously none of those are expected outcomes from unpinning versions of packages :)
2017-04-19T19:13:13 <mrtyler> heh, we don\'t have collectd stats for h-0005, where these build
2017-04-19T19:15:00 <mrtyler> because i was wondering if it\'s load induced
2017-04-19T19:15:41 <mrtyler> anyway thx for merging those gio :p
