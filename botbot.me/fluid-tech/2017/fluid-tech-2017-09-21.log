2017-09-21T12:50:17 <simonjb> I got a migraine at about 11:30 and had to take the afternoon off
2017-09-21T12:50:20 * kasparnet joined the channel
2017-09-21T12:51:00 <simonjb> I did start the wiki page before getting sick but haven\'t populated it yet with all my notes

2017-09-21T12:52:09 <simonjb> I will mostly take today off also and work tomorrow
2017-09-21T12:52:39 <simonjb> I will join the Nexus/MyL3/SJRK meeting at 2pm

2017-09-21T13:16:32 <alanharnum> gmoss: let\'s say this afternoon after the meeting
2017-09-21T13:16:46 <gmoss> Okay sounds good

2017-09-21T15:14:06 <alanharnum> hello clown, a question for you as someone who has done accessibility work on Linux - is there an equivalent tool to the Accessibility Inspector on OS X, that lets you graphically examine elements and see what they\'re passing to the Accessibility API?

2017-09-21T15:15:46 <clown> Hello alanharnum.  "Accerciser"

2017-09-21T15:16:25 <alanharnum> thanks clown!
2017-09-21T15:16:31 <alanharnum> https://wiki.gnome.org/action/show/Apps/Accerciser?action=show&redirect=Accerciser
2017-09-21T15:17:22 <clown> alanharnum:  I got https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Accerciser
2017-09-21T15:17:58 <clown> but, I don\'t know how up to date that is.
2017-09-21T15:18:08 * gtirloni has quit
2017-09-21T15:18:39 <jhernandez> clown: it is way outdated
2017-09-21T15:19:01 <clown> jhernandez:  is there a better description elsewhere?
2017-09-21T15:19:10 <jhernandez> no
2017-09-21T15:20:55 <jhernandez> the description is fine, but there are things that aren\'t true anymore, i.e.: pyORBit is not used anymore
2017-09-21T15:23:34 <jhernandez> the plugin tutorial needs to be updated according to the new scenario, i.e.:  we use pygobject
2017-09-21T15:25:09 <jhernandez> since I left Emergya, my efforts in Accerciser have been mostly focused on keeping it working as much as possible as the gnome platform evolves
2017-09-21T15:25:22 <jhernandez> pygobject stuff, wayland, etc
2017-09-21T15:27:24 <jhernandez> as far as I know, there\'s a problem with the ipython plugin due to the last changes on its API, which changes considerably from time to time
2017-09-21T15:27:43 <jhernandez> other than that, it *should* work :)

2017-09-21T17:16:40 <mrtyler> interesting
