2017-02-16T13:02:00 <gloob> stegru: having fun with windows api consistency across versions? haha
2017-02-16T13:02:29 <stegru> heh
2017-02-16T13:03:00 <gloob> JJ is not here, but he was having fun with windows ui mechanization consistency too
2017-02-16T13:03:07 <stegru> they say there\'s fragmentation across linux distros, but windows is worse
2017-02-16T13:03:37 * michelled joined the channel
2017-02-16T13:03:38 <gloob> it is worse because you cannot check into the code mainly
2017-02-16T13:03:51 <gloob> the documentation is scarce
2017-02-16T13:04:00 <stegru> oh yes i know that
2017-02-16T13:04:13 <gloob> it\'s really daunting job
2017-02-16T13:04:41 <stegru> fortunately with me, windows does it so i know it\'s possible, i just have to find out how windows does it
2017-02-16T13:06:56 <gloob> you get it fettled
2017-02-16T13:07:16 * gloob improving is north england accent
2017-02-16T13:09:10 <stegru> i\'ve never heard that one before
2017-02-16T13:09:11 <stegru> haha
2017-02-16T13:10:29 <gloob> you\'re not my marra, then
2017-02-16T13:12:42 <stegru> ah, urban dictionary
2017-02-16T13:13:09 <gloob> maybe I\'m going to deepp
2017-02-16T13:13:21 <gloob> I was using this as reference http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/64-slang-words-phrases-you-3026057
2017-02-16T13:13:40 <gloob> I like this one
2017-02-16T13:13:40 <gloob> Give your \'ead a wobble
2017-02-16T13:14:26 <stegru> yes, my wife says that one
2017-02-16T13:14:35 <stegru> she\'s from liverpool
2017-02-16T13:14:42 <gloob> stegru: and you?
2017-02-16T13:14:51 <gloob> manchester it was?
2017-02-16T13:15:17 <stegru> yes
2017-02-16T13:15:49 <stegru> only about 30 miles apart, but very different accents
2017-02-16T13:15:57 <stegru> to us, at least
2017-02-16T13:15:57 <gloob> I remember because my english teacher, she said because there\'s no uniformity about correct english accent I will teach you manchester accent xD
2017-02-16T13:16:00 <gloob> pretty peculiar
2017-02-16T13:17:04 <stegru> considering it\'s a small area (uk), the accents differ a lot - or is that just because i\'m fine tuned into it
2017-02-16T13:18:14 <gloob> same happens in Spain I guess
2017-02-16T13:19:02 <gloob> I love this sketch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FFRoYhTJQQ

2017-02-16T16:43:56 <amatas> hi gtirloni_ I realized that I don\'t have permissions to merge or assign PRs in the GPII project of Github
2017-02-16T16:44:35 <amatas> I\'ve fixed the name of the tasks in the PR, if everything is fine for you, could you merge it?
2017-02-16T16:47:31 <gtirloni_> amatas: thanks! i don\'t have permission to add you to the correct team (\'ci-and-infrastructure\')
2017-02-16T16:47:35 <gtirloni_> i\'ve merged the PR, thanks again
2017-02-16T16:48:17 <amatas> cool thanks!
2017-02-16T17:01:11 <amatas> thanks again gtirloni_
2017-02-16T17:01:17 <gtirloni_> :)
2017-02-16T17:01:48 <amatas> do you have permissions to add the Jenkins\' credentials to the gpii-app repository?
2017-02-16T17:01:56 <amatas> as you can see here: https://ci.gpii.net/view/All/job/gpii-app-tests/1/console
2017-02-16T17:02:16 <amatas> it seems that Jenkins needs access to the repository
2017-02-16T17:05:39 <gtirloni> let me see
2017-02-16T17:10:13 <amatas> gtirloni, do you have the credentials of gpii-bot user account?
2017-02-16T17:10:45 <gtirloni> amatas: that\'s what i was going to suggest... update the token or create a new one with the gpii-bot account
2017-02-16T17:10:51 <gtirloni> i don\'t have access to it :(
2017-02-16T17:10:59 <gtirloni> i think avtar set it up
2017-02-16T17:11:16 <gtirloni> maybe add \'gpii-bot\' to the ci-and-infrastructure team too
2017-02-16T17:12:00 <gtirloni> fluid-everyone: we need someone with super admin access to the GPII org in github to add \'gpii-bot\' and \'amatas\' to the \'ci-and-infrastructure\' team for the GPII/ci-service repo
2017-02-16T17:12:17 <amatas> gtirloni, jhernandez added gpii-bot to the repo
2017-02-16T17:12:36 <amatas> but, now we need to access as that account to accept the "invitation"
2017-02-16T17:12:47 * gtirloni looks around, don\'t see avtar
2017-02-16T17:12:51 <gtirloni> of course, it\'s thursday
2017-02-16T17:14:48 <gtirloni> i tried to reset the password, but it doesn\'t look like it\'s linked to any account i have access to
2017-02-16T17:15:02 <gtirloni> maybe email avtar? he may check hangouts and reply too
2017-02-16T17:15:11 <amatas> the mails are sent to me :]
2017-02-16T17:15:17 <gtirloni> niiice!
2017-02-16T17:15:45 <gtirloni> oh, i got it now too
2017-02-16T17:15:53 <gtirloni> so you\'re able to proceed? let me know if i can help
2017-02-16T17:16:32 <Bosmon> ok ok

2017-02-16T18:31:58 <jhernandez> Bosmon: quick question
2017-02-16T18:32:16 <jhernandez> I\'m having a problem while running the windows tests from gpii-app
2017-02-16T18:32:25 <jhernandez> in particular with this line https://github.com/GPII/windows/blob/hst-2017/gpii/node_modules/debugLogger/debugLogger.js#L92
2017-02-16T18:33:31 <jhernandez> the problem is that fluid.module.resolvePath is not returning a valid path, just %gpii-windows
2017-02-16T18:33:47 <Bosmon> Perhaps you haven\'t loaded the gpii-windows module yet
2017-02-16T18:34:00 <jhernandez> mmm
2017-02-16T18:34:10 <jhernandez> good point, let me check
2017-02-16T18:35:01 <Bosmon> It\'s registered on this line: https://github.com/GPII/windows/blob/master/index.js#L20
2017-02-16T18:38:34 <jhernandez> Bosmon: yes - problem solved
2017-02-16T18:38:42 <jhernandez> thanks!!
