2017-07-12T14:44:50 <clown> gtirloni:  I tried to add a watcher to a JIRA (GPII-2480), but was told that I didn\'t have permission.  What do I need for such permission?
2017-07-12T14:47:43 <gtirloni> clown: hi, what\'s a watcher? :)
2017-07-12T14:52:47 <gtirloni> clown: do you mean the "Start watching this issue" ?
2017-07-12T14:53:22 <clown> gtirloni:  close.  I am watching the issue since I created it.  But, I want to add another.
2017-07-12T14:53:43 <clown> If I click the "watchers" widget, I get a dialog that allows me to add a name.
2017-07-12T14:53:53 <clown> and "Add watchers" dialog.
2017-07-12T14:54:16 <clown> But, upon confirming my choice, I get an "error" message that says I don\'t have permission to add watchers.
2017-07-12T14:55:04 <clown> does that make sense, gtirloni?
2017-07-12T14:56:03 <clown> btw, cindyli added the person for me \xe2\x80\x94 she has the power!
