2017-06-02T14:25:20 <simonjb> hey kasparnet
2017-06-02T14:25:28 <kasparnet> hey simon
2017-06-02T14:25:31 <kasparnet> simonjb:
2017-06-02T14:26:20 <simonjb> would you happen to know if the GPII App installer at get.gpii.net is using a \'real\' device reporter or the list of installedSolutions.json?
2017-06-02T14:26:49 <simonjb> I\'m setting up a demo machine for Colin for next week
2017-06-02T14:27:11 <simonjb> and I\'m working with Justin_o to see if we can get his new chrome extension work running
2017-06-02T14:27:27 <simonjb> and we need to add a solution to the solutions registry for it
2017-06-02T14:27:42 <simonjb> and we\'re wondering if we also need to update installedSolutions.json
2017-06-02T14:27:46 <simonjb> thanks kasparnet
2017-06-02T14:28:27 <kasparnet> simonjb: yeah, I\'m pretty sure it uses the "installedSolutions.json" file by default
2017-06-02T14:28:40 <kasparnet> pretty sure meaning around 89%
2017-06-02T14:29:05 <simonjb> thanks kasparnet -- who would know for sure? or where would I look to see?
2017-06-02T14:29:15 <simonjb> maybe jhernandez ? ^
2017-06-02T14:29:34 <kasparnet> yeah, very likely jhernandez
2017-06-02T14:30:39 <kasparnet> I\'m not sure where to look for it -- except for the setting of environment variables on install - but having looked at the scripts that generate the installer recently, I dont remember seeing anything related to using a different config than the default one

2017-06-02T14:46:51 <Justin_o> amatas: hello, do you know if the windows installer creates log files?
2017-06-02T14:47:13 <Justin_o> amatas: to be more clear, a GPII instance that was installed via the installer
2017-06-02T14:49:42 <amatas> Justin_o: yes
2017-06-02T14:50:20 * mrtyler joined the channel
2017-06-02T14:50:21 <jhernandez> simonjb: gpii-app\'s hst-2017 branch uses the dynamic device reporter by default
2017-06-02T14:50:23 <jhernandez> ;)
2017-06-02T14:50:31 <amatas> you can find the logs at the "AppRoaming" hidden directory of the user\'s home directory
2017-06-02T14:50:46 <Justin_o> amatas: great thanks
2017-06-02T14:51:12 <simonjb> jhernandez: will the dynamic device reporter know about the chrome extension?
2017-06-02T14:51:42 <amatas> Justin_o: C:\\Users\\*\\AppData\\Roaming\\gpii\\*.txt
2017-06-02T14:51:53 <amatas> that is the correct path
2017-06-02T14:52:14 <Justin_o> amatas: thanks, have it pulled up now
2017-06-02T14:52:36 <jhernandez> simonjb: you need to update the solutions registry to report it as "alwaysInstalled"
2017-06-02T14:54:11 <simonjb> thanks jhernandez
2017-06-02T14:54:20 <jhernandez> but IIRC there was a conflict and that\'s why it\'s disabled
2017-06-02T14:56:10 <simonjb> jhernandez: do you remember the nature of the conflict? was it multiple ATs applying the same setting?
2017-06-02T14:56:27 <simonjb> I see a note to GPII-1998
2017-06-02T14:56:32 <jhernandez> yeah, it\'s a matchmaker thing
2017-06-02T14:57:26 <simonjb> jhernandez: so, do you think it\'s feasible for us to get the extension working?
2017-06-02T14:57:35 <jhernandez> so IIRC, it was exactly the opposite, that a setting wasn\'t being applied because it was being passed to another solution
2017-06-02T14:57:39 <jhernandez> hmmm
2017-06-02T14:57:49 <simonjb> maybe if we had a preference set that avoided that case?
2017-06-02T14:57:53 <jhernandez> yeah
2017-06-02T14:58:24 <jhernandez> if I\'m not wrong, you can use an np set that only uses app specific terms
