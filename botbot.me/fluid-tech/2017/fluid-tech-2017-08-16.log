2017-08-16T15:02:04 <mrtyler> doesn\'t matter to me
2017-08-16T15:02:23 <mrtyler> i\'m trying to get into my skype account
2017-08-16T15:02:31 <mrtyler> microsoft decided i needed to do a bunch of account verification nonsense
2017-08-16T15:04:55 <amatas> I\'m fine with either of two
2017-08-16T15:05:30 <amatas> let\'s try gotomeeting seems to be more stable
2017-08-16T15:05:34 <gtirloni> ok
2017-08-16T15:05:37 <amatas> to avoid audio problems
2017-08-16T15:05:41 <gtirloni> which room?
2017-08-16T15:06:13 <amatas> room 2 if mrtyler can open it

2017-08-16T18:39:39 <alanharnum> Keyboard provides an api for managing a virtual keyboard. The high level api is page.type, which takes raw characters and generates proper keydown, keypress/input, and keyup events on your page.
2017-08-16T18:39:39 <alanharnum> For finer control, you can use keyboard.down, keyboard.up, and keyboard.sendCharacter to manually fire events as if they were generated from a real keyboard."

2017-08-16T19:00:01 <simonjb> ok cindyli: I\'ve updated my notes on \'expired\'
2017-08-16T19:01:05 * alanharnum has quit
2017-08-16T19:03:37 <cindyli> thanks, simonjb. i think storing "timestampExpires" instead of "lifetimeSeconds" is a super good idea. i\'m also looking into how to compare "timestampExpires" with now()
2017-08-16T19:04:40 <simonjb> cindyli: I\'m thinking that we would need to use startkey and endkey -- see my recent comment
2017-08-16T19:05:41 <cindyli> yes, i saw it. i think it might be doable, still need to give a try. the part i\'m not sure about is whether it would work with the string format of timestamp
2017-08-16T19:06:16 <cindyli> the timestamp right now saved in the db is like "Mon May 29 2016 13:54:00 GMT-0400 (EDT)"
2017-08-16T19:06:57 <simonjb> cindyli: http://docs.couchdb.org/en/2.0.0/couchapp/views/collation.html#sorting-by-dates
2017-08-16T19:07:35 <cindyli> right, in order to use key comparison, the format might need to be changed to number of seconds as what\'s returned by Date(). getTime()
2017-08-16T19:07:50 <simonjb> I think we\'d need either a text format that is lexigraphically sortable, or store an integeer
2017-08-16T19:08:00 <simonjb> right
2017-08-16T19:08:24 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-08-16T19:09:22 <simonjb> cindyli: Date.getTime() is probably a good option I think
2017-08-16T19:09:24 <cindyli> i\'m reading couchdb list functions which seem able to do post processing on data returned by couchdb views
2017-08-16T19:09:25 <cindyli> https://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/Formatting_with_Show_and_List#Listing_Views_with_CouchDB_0.10_and_later
2017-08-16T19:10:03 <cindyli> so that we could maintain the human readable strings in documents meanwhile with comparing dates
2017-08-16T19:11:53 <cindyli> well, the more recent couchdb doc shows list functions are for rendering contents tho - http://guide.couchdb.org/draft/transforming.html
2017-08-16T19:18:03 <cindyli> simonjb: "a text format that is lexigraphically sortable" - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4812235/whats-the-best-way-to-store-datetimes-timestamps-in-couchdb#answer-4815878
2017-08-16T19:18:55 <simonjb> cindyli: that seems reasonable to me
2017-08-16T19:20:24 <simonjb> cindyli: I just edited my comment to use "{}" rather than "currentTime +  a day" for endkey
2017-08-16T19:20:54 <cindyli> simonjb: cool. i will replace "expiresIn" with "timestampExpires". If some day each client is able to define the preferred token lifetime, that data can ve saved in the "GPII App Installation Clients" document
2017-08-16T19:21:33 <simonjb> cindyli: yes
2017-08-16T19:21:40 <cindyli> thanks for digging deep into this, simonjb
2017-08-16T19:22:54 <simonjb> cindyli: does this seem better? rather than storing \'expired\'?
2017-08-16T19:23:24 <cindyli> i think it\'s better, simonjb
2017-08-16T19:23:29 <simonjb> ok, cool
2017-08-16T19:24:06 <cindyli> thanks, simonjb
2017-08-16T19:26:30 <simonjb> cindyli: we do add some querying overhead because we now add the time comparison but it\'s constrained to documents of the specified gpii token and client
2017-08-16T19:27:20 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-08-16T19:27:42 <simonjb> and we gain not having to manage the keeping up to date of the expired state in the database
2017-08-16T19:29:43 <simonjb> what\'s interesting compared to SQL querying, is needing to arrange your querying parameters along a single sorted key dimension
2017-08-16T19:29:57 <simonjb> picking keys from a range
2017-08-16T19:30:46 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-08-16T19:30:53 <simonjb> we can\'t do ranged boolean AND queries
2017-08-16T19:31:30 <simonjb> so if we had 2 timestamps we wanted to query against, I can\'t think of a way of doing it
2017-08-16T19:32:13 <simonjb> other than querying against one in a view and then filtering as a secondary step in client code
2017-08-16T19:32:35 <simonjb> is multi-step view querying possible in the couchdb api?
2017-08-16T19:33:03 * avtar joined the channel
2017-08-16T19:35:40 <simonjb> or having 2 views and then calculating the intersection
2017-08-16T19:35:41 <cindyli> simonjb: from what i learnt so far, couchdb seems not supporting querying by multiple-step ranges
2017-08-16T19:35:58 <simonjb> it\'s interesting
2017-08-16T19:36:26 <cindyli> simonjb: the intersection might need to be outside of couchdb
2017-08-16T19:36:31 <simonjb> yes
2017-08-16T19:36:44 <cindyli> i mean the calculation of the intersection
2017-08-16T19:36:53 <simonjb> yes, I think you\'re right
