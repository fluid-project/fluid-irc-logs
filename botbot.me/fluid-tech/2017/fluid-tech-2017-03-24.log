2017-03-24T15:23:14 <mrtyler> is there a way to override values in ansible.cfg from the command line? i haven\'t been able to figure it out
2017-03-24T15:23:35 <mrtyler> specifically: i want to override ansible.cfg:remote_port in the ops repo
2017-03-24T15:24:32 <mrtyler> i tried to workaround it with \'--ssh-extra-args="-p 22" --scp-extra-args="-P 22"\' but that didn\'t work
2017-03-24T15:24:47 <mrtyler> i.e. ansible still tries to use port 7022
2017-03-24T15:25:21 <gtirloni> yeah, i think there isn\'t a formal way to override any configs there. you may or may not have access to some of those settings through env vars (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/14150)
2017-03-24T15:25:47 <gtirloni> http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_configuration.html#environmental-configuration
2017-03-24T15:26:19 <mrtyler> aha, let\'s try ANSIBLE_REMOTE_PORT
2017-03-24T15:30:30 <mrtyler> i think that got it
2017-03-24T15:30:32 <mrtyler> thanks gtirloni  :)
2017-03-24T15:30:36 <gtirloni> yw!
2017-03-24T15:30:43 <mrtyler> fwiw i think --sftp-extra-args is simply broken
2017-03-24T15:31:01 <mrtyler> i specify -P 22 and the debug output still has it contacting 7022
2017-03-24T15:35:25 <gtirloni> hmm maybe "-o Port=22" will work.. i don\'t know if they mean these will be passed directly to the sftp binary or to some library
2017-03-24T15:38:25 <mrtyler> well --extra-ssh-args *does* work
2017-03-24T15:38:33 <mrtyler> so idk
2017-03-24T15:38:51 <mrtyler> i\'ll file an issue against ansible
2017-03-24T15:39:03 <mrtyler> but the ANSIBLE_REMOTE_PORT workaround unblocks me so thanks again for that
2017-03-24T15:39:24 <gtirloni> cool
