2017-07-27T14:27:31 <simonjb> hi there Justin_o, I was wondering if we had any plans to make an infusion dev release to npm any time soon?
2017-07-27T14:28:30 <Justin_o> I think i made one about a week ago, if that's recent enough for you. I'll definitely be making one after Bosmon merges my PRs as well
2017-07-27T14:28:34 <Justin_o> did you need one sooner?
2017-07-27T14:29:20 <simonjb> one from a week ago would be great
2017-07-27T14:29:40 <simonjb> how do I find it? https://www.npmjs.com/package/infusion says 2.0.0 is latest
2017-07-27T14:30:08 <Justin_o> actually looks like someone made one today
2017-07-27T14:30:08 <Justin_o> 3.0.0-dev.20170727T125648Z.47055ca
2017-07-27T14:30:31 <Justin_o> so if you want to see, there is an npm command
2017-07-27T14:30:32 <Justin_o> npm show infusion versions
2017-07-27T14:30:45 <Justin_o> that will show all versions including pre-releases
2017-07-27T14:31:13 <Justin_o> also i think you should have access to create dev releases if you need to. we use the fluid-publish node module for doing that
2017-07-27T14:31:13 <simonjb> awesome, thanks Justin_o
2017-07-27T14:32:05 <Justin_o> np
2017-07-27T14:32:12 <Justin_o> and hope you're feeling better today
2017-07-27T14:42:55 <simonjb> thanks Justin_o, I'm still feeling tired but getting better
2017-07-27T14:43:22 <Bosmon> simonjb - I made one only a few minutes ago
2017-07-27T14:43:37 <Bosmon> Yes, that is the one Justin_o just referenced
2017-07-27T14:44:19 <simonjb> great, thanks Bosmon
