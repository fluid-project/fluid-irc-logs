2017-06-28T18:19:13 <gtirloni> kasparnet: CI has been configured to work with the changes from tony's PR
2017-06-28T18:19:57 <kasparnet> ok, so updating to latest master or something should make it work again? gtirloni
2017-06-28T18:20:03 <gtirloni> he added some details here: https://github.com/the-t-in-rtf/universal/blob/1dc0f9c757f1e456cee8f02a8dfc3b9e2cb7c63d/README.md
2017-06-28T18:20:17 <gtirloni> i'm afraid master is still missing those changes, because they weren't merged
2017-06-28T18:20:43 <gtirloni> everything points to PR#508 being okay.. but cindyli and Justin_o are running more tests (see #fluid-work)
2017-06-28T18:20:54 <kasparnet> ahh ok
2017-06-28T18:21:07 <kasparnet> in that case I wont panic about my pull request failing
2017-06-28T18:21:15 <gtirloni> don't panic :)

2017-06-28T11:13:54 <kasparne_> ok, so I have a question about one of your comments on my pull
2017-06-28T11:14:07 <kasparne_> the functions - which I right now pass as functions
2017-06-28T11:14:16 <kasparne_> so two things:
2017-06-28T11:14:21 * gtirloni joined the channel
2017-06-28T11:14:33 <kasparne_> first of all, it\'s quite convenient to be able to pass them as functions for testing purposes
2017-06-28T11:14:35 <kasparne_> for example
2017-06-28T11:14:56 <kasparne_> https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/513/files#diff-7606bb3507531543555d1f8db64901d8
2017-06-28T11:15:06 <kasparne_> in the lifecycleManagerQueueTests
2017-06-28T11:15:34 * kasparnet has quit
2017-06-28T11:15:49 <kasparne_> I\'m saving a lot of 99% similar functions by being able to generate them simply as functions (via the createCustomTask/promiseWrapFun functions)
2017-06-28T11:16:36 <kasparne_> I agree in the general case I should use strings, and document that strings are preferred
2017-06-28T11:16:56 <kasparne_> but would it be bad karma to allow functions passed directly as well?
2017-06-28T11:19:13 <Bosmon> Well.... there\'s always a place for "pure promise utilities".... at least until the revolution comes
2017-06-28T11:19:31 <Bosmon> It might be a bit awkward to have the functionality mixed
2017-06-28T11:20:04 <Bosmon> I need to review your utilities a bit better
2017-06-28T11:20:53 * the-t-in-rtf has quit
2017-06-28T11:21:55 <Bosmon> I\'d say for your test utilities its ok to just clean them up a bit because they aren\'t really all that general purpose anyway
2017-06-28T11:28:18 <kasparne_> Bosmon: so what does that mean in terms of functions vs. strings?
2017-06-28T11:29:27 <kasparne_> also, is there a way to make infusion _not_ expand stuff
2017-06-28T11:29:35 <kasparne_> as you can see here https://github.com/kaspermarkus/universal/blob/b8bc3b117d8ab39d256a5f4edc22981765914800/gpii/node_modules/lifecycleManager/src/LifecycleManager.js#L102-L104
2017-06-28T11:29:49 <kasparne_> I\'m using IoC to add the tasks to the queue
2017-06-28T11:30:07 <kasparne_> but fluid expands "{that}.processStop" into its function automatically
2017-06-28T11:30:18 <kasparne_> which I dont want if I am to pass a string
2017-06-28T11:35:49 * Justin_o joined the channel
2017-06-28T11:45:40 <Bosmon> Yes, awkward, isn\'t it :)
2017-06-28T11:45:46 <Bosmon> This is somewhat why I made my suggestion #2
2017-06-28T11:46:17 <Bosmon> It\'s probably even helpful here to make a special-purpose rather than a general-purpose mechanism
2017-06-28T11:46:26 <Bosmon> Just to be even clearer about the kinds of things which can appear in the queue
2017-06-28T11:58:08 <kasparne_> yeah
2017-06-28T11:58:11 <kasparne_> that makes sense
2017-06-28T11:58:39 <kasparne_> although that even further pushes my need for being able to provide functions for the tasks
2017-06-28T11:58:42 <kasparne_> for testing purposes
2017-06-28T11:59:16 <kasparne_> .. although I guess maybe I could extend the component or something for the tests
2017-06-28T12:02:13 * the-t-in-rtf joined the channel
2017-06-28T12:12:59 <kasparne_> Bosmon: I\'m still not clear on your opinion on functions vs. strings.. would it be acceptable to allow it to accept functions for testing purposes, or should I try and work around it, using some sort of dark magic
2017-06-28T12:20:07 * michelled joined the channel
2017-06-28T12:42:30 <Bosmon> kasparne_ - "it"?
2017-06-28T12:45:08 <kasparne_> well, I could use dark magic to allow it to only use strings - including for the test cases
2017-06-28T12:45:10 <kasparne_> Bosmon:
2017-06-28T12:45:43 <Bosmon> but which utility?
2017-06-28T12:47:57 <kasparne_> I would use in my dark magic?
2017-06-28T12:48:05 <kasparne_> or which utility I\'m testing?
2017-06-28T12:48:07 <kasparne_> or ...?
2017-06-28T12:48:24 <kasparne_> Bosmon:
2017-06-28T12:48:35 * kasparne_ is so confused
2017-06-28T12:48:40 * kasparne_ is now known as kasparnet
2017-06-28T12:49:05 <Bosmon> Well I dunno, whatever you are talking about :)
2017-06-28T12:49:17 <Bosmon> You said "would it be acceptable to allow it to accept functions for testing purposes"
2017-06-28T12:49:22 <Bosmon> Whatever you are talking about here :)
2017-06-28T12:49:25 <kasparnet> oh
2017-06-28T12:49:26 <kasparnet> i see
2017-06-28T12:49:45 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-06-28T12:50:04 <kasparnet> well, the queue has its items that each have a "func" key
2017-06-28T12:50:11 <kasparnet> the value of that func
2017-06-28T12:50:15 <Bosmon> Oh right, I see
2017-06-28T12:50:49 * cindyli joined the channel
2017-06-28T12:54:04 <Bosmon> Here\'s an idea - why don\'t you just sneakily apply this function
2017-06-28T12:54:05 <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/core/js/FluidIoC.js#L1705
2017-06-28T12:54:35 <Bosmon> It\'ll save you implementing something nasty, and then you can just say "supports any record supported as an Infusion invoker"
2017-06-28T12:54:39 * alanharn_ joined the channel

2017-06-28T15:04:28 <Bosmon> kasparnet - ok, for that I suggest you just set up a special options area with the configuration you want, and mark it as "noexpand" - and then just write an "onCreate" listener which fabricates the methods by hand
2017-06-28T15:04:34 <Bosmon> It\'s a bit clunky but it\'s what the current framework allows
2017-06-28T15:04:42 <Bosmon> This will also let you cut down on the repetition a bit
2017-06-28T15:05:05 <Bosmon> Given each of these involves an "addToQueue" pluss a func plus an {arguments}.0 etc.
