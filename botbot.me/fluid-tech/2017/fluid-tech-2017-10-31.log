2017-10-31T17:33:18 <colinclark> hahaha
2017-10-31T17:33:21 * javjarfer has quit
2017-10-31T17:33:21 <colinclark> well done
2017-10-31T17:33:29 <colinclark> anyway, i\'m stoked to have graphs like this
2017-10-31T17:33:33 <colinclark> very nice, thanks
2017-10-31T17:33:34 <mrtyler> me too!
2017-10-31T17:33:51 <mrtyler> i\'m a relative metrics noob but the field is growing on me
2017-10-31T17:33:57 <mrtyler> i\'ve been reading a lot of charity majors on observability
2017-10-31T17:34:03 <colinclark> oh cool
2017-10-31T17:34:13 <colinclark> i\'ll have to do some reading once this presentation is in order
2017-10-31T17:34:25 <colinclark> in the meantime, i should sneak off to privately panic about it :)
2017-10-31T17:34:29 <mrtyler> fun fact: at my last job, we would sometimes label big cpu spikes and other anomalies after the person who caused them
2017-10-31T17:34:32 <mrtyler> "Mt. Alfredo" :p
2017-10-31T17:34:36 <colinclark> hahaha
2017-10-31T17:34:38 <colinclark> ouch
2017-10-31T17:34:48 <colinclark> these graphs would be great to sonify
2017-10-31T17:34:57 <colinclark> GPII oscillators
2017-10-31T17:35:03 * javjarfer_ has quit
2017-10-31T17:35:04 <mrtyler> there was a project long ago
2017-10-31T17:35:11 <mrtyler> that would turn your firewall logs into birdsong and other sounds
2017-10-31T17:35:19 <ussjoin> https://corte.si/posts/choir/intro/choir.html
2017-10-31T17:35:20 <mrtyler> so normally it\'s just sort of background noise
2017-10-31T17:35:24 <ussjoin> That one, mrtyler?
2017-10-31T17:35:29 <mrtyler> but if someone is attacking you, you hear it
2017-10-31T17:35:32 <ussjoin> I was *just* wishing that it still existed....
2017-10-31T17:35:50 <ussjoin> (Like literally reading this discussion and thinking that, hence I had the link in front of me.)
2017-10-31T17:36:09 <mrtyler> ussjoin: i feel like i heard about it before 2013 but obv it\'s not an entirely unheard-of idea
2017-10-31T17:36:16 * kasparnet joined the channel
2017-10-31T17:36:50 <ussjoin> Fair enough, you might well have. That was the post where I went "doooooooodddd....." and wished I was cool enough to have that running on my logs.
2017-10-31T17:36:51 <mrtyler> aw the demo is broken :(
2017-10-31T17:37:04 <ussjoin> (I do see a startup has https://choir.io/ , but no telling if it\'s at all related...)
2017-10-31T17:37:14 <ussjoin> Yeah, the old choir has been offline since ~2015.
2017-10-31T17:37:17 <mrtyler> yeah i think that\'s what has taken over the demo link
2017-10-31T17:37:26 <mrtyler> this is the header: DELETEGAPPSNOTBEFORE20170102UTC.HTML CHOIR.IO
2017-10-31T17:37:29 <mrtyler> lulz
2017-10-31T17:37:49 <ussjoin> Heh. Yep, saw that too.
2017-10-31T17:38:23 <ussjoin> Anyway, makes me sad. I\'ve toyed with making a replacement, but it\'s gotten stacked behind other more-fun side projects.
2017-10-31T17:38:27 <colinclark> IN STEALTH
2017-10-31T17:38:43 <mrtyler> i feel like if you\'ve announced that you\'re IN STEALTH, you may have missed a memo somewhere
2017-10-31T17:38:59 <colinclark> man, these startup people have spent too much time playing Splinter Cell or something
2017-10-31T17:39:01 <ussjoin> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPre1TtvTqk re: stealth
2017-10-31T17:39:11 <mrtyler> reminds me of a joke from a philosophy of language class: "hey! what are you doing over there?!" "oh, just lurking."
2017-10-31T17:40:01 <mrtyler> as a man, i do identify with feeling like an autistic 12 year-old
2017-10-31T17:40:05 <mrtyler> ;)
2017-10-31T17:40:45 <colinclark> hahaha :)
2017-10-31T17:41:00 <mrtyler> colinclark: anyway, gl on your surprise keynote. i\'m sure you\'ll do great. :) and enjoy colorado
2017-10-31T17:41:07 <mrtyler> it\'s gon\' be cold :) :)
2017-10-31T17:41:10 <colinclark> mini-keynote
2017-10-31T17:41:15 <colinclark> fortunately i\'m the mini keynote :)
2017-10-31T17:41:21 <colinclark> i haven\'t even seen a forecast
2017-10-31T17:41:24 <ussjoin> colinclark What are you keynoting?
2017-10-31T17:41:31 <ussjoin> Are you a Thought Leader?
2017-10-31T17:41:36 <colinclark> mini keynoting
2017-10-31T17:41:40 <mrtyler> lol
2017-10-31T17:41:42 <colinclark> no, not a thoughtleader
2017-10-31T17:41:43 <ussjoin> Are you a Mini Thought Leader?
2017-10-31T17:41:47 <mrtyler> haha
2017-10-31T17:41:50 <colinclark> but I AM a TECHNOLOGY FUTURIST
2017-10-31T17:41:54 <ussjoin> Thought Sergeant?
2017-10-31T17:42:09 <ussjoin> So you and Ray Kurzweil are competitors?
2017-10-31T17:42:16 <mrtyler> i\'m trying to decide if a Mini Thought Leader is a little person who is also a thought leader, or a thought leader who specializes in minutiae
2017-10-31T17:42:40 <mrtyler> "i am australia\'
2017-10-31T17:42:48 <mrtyler> s #1 expert in phytoplankton"
2017-10-31T17:42:52 <colinclark> hahaha
2017-10-31T17:43:04 <ussjoin> I think the latter. He can lead the conversation around, say, transient coloration for popover ads.
2017-10-31T17:43:16 <colinclark> I\'m speaking at the Coleman Institute\'s conference on cognitive disabilities
2017-10-31T17:43:21 <mrtyler> that would be one heck of a keynote!
2017-10-31T17:43:32 <mrtyler> "mini keynote" --colin clark
2017-10-31T17:43:51 <ussjoin> colinclark Neat!
2017-10-31T17:44:13 <colinclark> I\'m going to talk about techniques for designing with people, rather than "for" them
2017-10-31T17:44:19 <colinclark> and maybe a bit about embodied learning
2017-10-31T17:44:34 <colinclark> and perhaps just the tiniest bit on inclusion and machine learning
2017-10-31T17:44:45 <colinclark> possibly I\'ll just talk about the weather
2017-10-31T17:45:13 <mrtyler> i was wrong. weather actually looks p nice for you next week
2017-10-31T17:45:18 <ussjoin> I\'m loving https://www.colemaninstitute.org/inclusive-conference-presentation-guidelines/ .
2017-10-31T17:45:19 <mrtyler> bozeman is cold tho :D
2017-10-31T17:46:07 <colinclark> it\'s really good, ussjoin
2017-10-31T17:47:01 <colinclark> anyway, with that, I\'d better hit the road and get prepped
2017-10-31T17:47:10 <colinclark> send me a text if those spikes come back :P
2017-10-31T17:47:34 <mrtyler> i will, once i have alertmanager set up ;)

2017-10-31T11:52:47 <kasparnet> hey
2017-10-31T11:52:59 <kasparnet> how was your weekend, Bosmon
2017-10-31T11:54:00 <kasparnet> and yeah, a 3 minute latency on answering from me... pretty impressive - i know!
2017-10-31T12:07:57 <kasparnet> Bosmon, gotta go for lunch but will be back in ~30
2017-10-31T12:14:27 <Bosmon> Ok
2017-10-31T12:14:34 <Bosmon> I am here : P
2017-10-31T12:30:02 * Justin_o joined the channel
2017-10-31T12:33:46 <kasparnet> hey again Bosmon
2017-10-31T12:34:07 <kasparnet> I\'m looking at the tests for the PCP channel
2017-10-31T12:34:19 <kasparnet> where I have added the preference change functionality to the framework
2017-10-31T12:34:47 <Bosmon> kasparnet - awesome
2017-10-31T12:35:22 <kasparnet> but for some reason the gpii.pcpChannel.modelChangeListener isn\'t triggering
2017-10-31T12:35:45 <kasparnet> there isn\'t some requirement to the "depth" of the changes
2017-10-31T12:35:55 <kasparnet> that they have to be at the top level or something like that
2017-10-31T12:36:13 <Bosmon> No
2017-10-31T12:36:18 <Bosmon> Is your code checked in?
2017-10-31T12:37:04 <kasparnet> nope
2017-10-31T12:37:09 <kasparnet> gimme a sec
2017-10-31T12:41:07 <kasparnet> Bosmon, https://github.com/kaspermarkus/universal/tree/GPII-2655
2017-10-31T12:41:33 <kasparnet> Bosmon, so the update functionality,etc., seems to be working just fine
2017-10-31T12:41:45 <Bosmon> kasparnet - brilliant!
2017-10-31T12:41:51 <kasparnet> it\'s the triggering of the modelChangeListener on the pcpChannel that wont function
2017-10-31T12:41:54 <Bosmon> May as well talk in fluid-work so the Astea folks can hear
2017-10-31T12:43:30 <kasparnet> sure

2017-10-31T14:55:41 <mrtyler> it is a start at least :)
2017-10-31T14:56:15 <amatas> I wonder if its possible to use the hostname (or something more descriptive master-xx,node-xx) of the vm instead of the IP address
2017-10-31T14:56:23 <amatas> sure it is!
2017-10-31T14:56:35 <mrtyler> yeah that was bugging me too :)

2017-10-31T16:59:04 <amatas> I\'m waiting for a drop of the used memory in the case of the flowmanager
2017-10-31T16:59:25 <mrtyler> sounds like a question for a node developer :)
2017-10-31T17:01:01 <mrtyler> one caution btw
2017-10-31T17:01:07 <mrtyler> make sure you\'re looking at the y-axis
2017-10-31T17:01:22 <mrtyler> sometimes a graph looks crazy, and then you realize it\'s just the cpu bouncing between 0.02 and 0.03 utilization
2017-10-31T17:01:41 <mrtyler> flowmanager seems to be... doing a little more than that however

2017-10-31T17:22:01 <colinclark> are you thinking we might have a memory leak, amatas?
2017-10-31T17:24:47 <amatas> colinclark: don\'t know, something happened and the memory dropped from 75 megs to 48
2017-10-31T17:25:19 <colinclark> curious
2017-10-31T17:25:32 <amatas> perhaps is some kind of garbage collector?
2017-10-31T17:26:56 <mrtyler> colinclark: did you see the graph we\'re talking about?
2017-10-31T17:27:00 <mrtyler> http://grafana.dev-tyler.gpii.net/dashboard/db/pods?orgId=1&var-namespace=All&var-pod=flowmanager-c94b5ff89-z6pjq&var-container=All
2017-10-31T17:27:15 <colinclark> yup i\'m just looking at that one
2017-10-31T17:27:15 <mrtyler> i don\'t think either of us knows anything other than the graph looks pretty funny :)
2017-10-31T17:27:24 <colinclark> it\'s pretty funny
2017-10-31T17:27:35 <mrtyler> aren\'t metrics fun? ;)
2017-10-31T17:27:35 <colinclark> and I was looking at it a little while ago, thinking, wow, it looks like it\'s leaking
2017-10-31T17:27:41 <colinclark> that gradual build up
2017-10-31T17:27:50 <mrtyler> i had the same thought
2017-10-31T17:27:54 <colinclark> the sawtooths probably being GC, but the angle was slightly on the rise
2017-10-31T17:28:02 <mrtyler> yeah between 0100-0400
2017-10-31T17:28:13 <mrtyler> altho now it has fallen back to ~48MB
2017-10-31T17:28:19 <colinclark> very fascinating
2017-10-31T17:28:20 <mrtyler> so maybe it is gc after all
2017-10-31T17:28:31 <mrtyler> note that there is *nothing* happening on this cluster since i spun it up last night
2017-10-31T17:28:35 <colinclark> V8 may have some thresholds at which it runs more aggressive GC
2017-10-31T17:28:48 <mrtyler> right, something like that is plausible
2017-10-31T17:28:54 <colinclark> nothing happening, meaning we don\'t expect to have received any requests?
2017-10-31T17:29:14 <mrtyler> right
2017-10-31T17:29:20 <colinclark> if my memory serves me, the CBFM might well be incorrectly ticking a very expensive clock
2017-10-31T17:29:21 <mrtyler> and also that i wasn\'t doing anyything else to the cluster either
2017-10-31T17:29:25 <colinclark> but I don\'t know
2017-10-31T17:29:35 <colinclark> there was, in Cloud4All the concept of "Context awareness"
2017-10-31T17:29:35 <mrtyler> no deployments or other activities
2017-10-31T17:29:39 * javjarfer_ joined the channel
2017-10-31T17:29:56 <colinclark> and I believe one aspect of this is that the Flow Manager may have a time event that fires
2017-10-31T17:30:08 <mrtyler> interesting
2017-10-31T17:30:09 <colinclark> could be ticking away and slowly accumulating small amounts of garbage, I don\'t know
2017-10-31T17:30:17 <colinclark> it shouldn\'t be set up in the production configuration of the CBFM
2017-10-31T17:30:24 <colinclark> which I assume jhernandez will notice if it is
2017-10-31T17:30:29 <colinclark> I could just be inventing this, for the record :)
2017-10-31T17:30:36 <colinclark> you\'d see it in your logs, I imagine, if it was there
2017-10-31T17:31:02 <colinclark> i\'ll enjoy watching this graph over the course of the afternoon
2017-10-31T17:31:04 <mrtyler> fwiw, all 6 of the running flowmanager pods have a similar looking memory profile
2017-10-31T17:31:07 <colinclark> you can see it\'s growing a tiny bit again
2017-10-31T17:31:10 <mrtyler> so i don\'t think it\'s, say, an isolated anomaly :)
2017-10-31T17:31:33 <colinclark> yup
2017-10-31T17:31:41 <colinclark> that big CPU spike does correspond with the reduction of memory
2017-10-31T17:31:43 <mrtyler> here\'s a very slightly different shape: http://grafana.dev-tyler.gpii.net/dashboard/db/pods?orgId=1&from=now-24h&to=now&var-namespace=All&var-pod=flowmanager-c94b5ff89-2j9kq&var-container=All
2017-10-31T17:31:54 <mrtyler> tell-tale sign of garbage collection
2017-10-31T17:31:58 <mrtyler> cpu spike -> memory reduction
2017-10-31T17:32:07 <mrtyler> ah however!
2017-10-31T17:32:10 <mrtyler> you have to watch the axes
2017-10-31T17:32:11 <colinclark> Bosmon: You might find these graphs interesting to look at some time :)
2017-10-31T17:32:18 <mrtyler> how big is that "big spike" really?
2017-10-31T17:32:22 <colinclark> it\'s HUGE
2017-10-31T17:32:28 <colinclark> look how point it looks!
2017-10-31T17:32:31 <colinclark> pointy
2017-10-31T17:32:34 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-10-31T17:32:35 <mrtyler> haha
2017-10-31T17:32:39 <amatas> :D
2017-10-31T17:32:40 <colinclark> scary and dangerous, that one
2017-10-31T17:32:49 <mrtyler> as an outdoorsman, i have to point out that prominence != elevation ;)
2017-10-31T17:32:55 <colinclark> hahaha
2017-10-31T17:32:59 <colinclark> it\'s like Space Needle of CPU usage
