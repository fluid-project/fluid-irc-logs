b'2017-01-26T14:49:41 <Bosmon> And then it is our job to execute it
2017-01-26T14:49:53 <Bosmon> That\'s why we have made so much of our review process :)
2017-01-26T14:50:21 <kasparnet> ok ok
2017-01-26T14:51:11 <kasparnet> Next question: If they DONT write stuff like that in their configure block, how do we know which blocks to run on login?
2017-01-26T14:51:18 <kasparnet> which settingshandler blocks, that is?
2017-01-26T14:51:54 <kasparnet> In the case of JAWS in the pad - how would we know to actually run the "settings.launchHandler" - unless we allow for a "start" and "stop" block where stuff like this is defined?
2017-01-26T14:53:06 <Bosmon> But remember that the effect of this, when run in "configure" would be a noop
2017-01-26T14:53:39 <Bosmon> Because, RECALL, that since this behaves like a setting, the effect of setting a setting to its existing value should be nothing
2017-01-26T14:53:51 <Bosmon> If the process is already running, and it should be running, then nothing will be done
2017-01-26T14:54:04 <Bosmon> And this should be the answer to your latest question too
2017-01-26T14:55:29 <Bosmon> I mean - isn\'t it the case that all settingsHandler blocks run on all actions?
2017-01-26T14:55:37 <Bosmon> I guess we still need some kind of "actions"
2017-01-26T14:55:40 <Bosmon> Did we lost those entirely?
2017-01-26T14:58:16 <kasparnet> Bosmon: the way it works right now is based on whatever is in the "configure", "restore", "start", "stop" and "update" blocks
2017-01-26T14:58:38 <kasparnet> so in terms of configure and restore, one can tell the system which settings blocks to run
2017-01-26T14:59:11 <kasparnet> and from "update" you can reference the "start" and "stop" blocks
2017-01-26T14:59:53 <kasparnet> well, I guess actually that all blocks can reference "settings.XYZ" as it is implemented now

2017-01-26T15:52:09 <Bosmon> Well, I think we plan to keep the blocks around, just in case there are "arbitrary actions" which need to happen in them
2017-01-26T15:52:20 <Bosmon> It\'s just the all the launching actions will be converted into settings.XYZ blocks
2017-01-26T15:52:36 <Bosmon> So perhaps in practice there will be no change in logic to the lifecycleManager
2017-01-26T15:52:55 <Bosmon> This will be a fix that affects the matchmaker and solutions entries, and creation of new settingsHandlers

2017-01-26T10:21:40 <kasparnet> hi Bosmon
2017-01-26T10:33:35 <Bosmon> kasparnet
2017-01-26T10:39:44 <kasparnet> ...only 6 minutes latency on my response, that\'s progress
2017-01-26T10:40:08 <kasparnet> so I\'m confusing myself a bit with the "launch" settingshandler block
2017-01-26T10:40:17 <kasparnet> we have the description here: https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-1235
2017-01-26T10:40:58 <kasparnet> and here: https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-1230
2017-01-26T10:42:00 <kasparnet> but it seems to me the relationship between the "launch" settingsHandlers ("launchHandler" from hereon) and the "start" "stop" and "update" blocks is a bit weird
2017-01-26T10:42:41 <kasparnet> if the behaviour of how to launch, stop, update and check an application (isRunning) is already defined in their respective blocks
2017-01-26T10:42:53 <kasparnet> I\'m not sure I see a need for an explicit launchHandler
2017-01-26T10:43:02 <kasparnet> as opposed to just something built into the framework
2017-01-26T10:43:05 <kasparnet> Bosmon: ^
2017-01-26T10:43:19 <kasparnet> since the job of the launchhandler would always be the same
2017-01-26T10:44:17 <kasparnet> ie. if we\'re running a "start" block, use a combination of the information in "start" and "isRunning" to get the application running and ensure that it IS actually running
2017-01-26T10:44:40 <kasparnet> and same thing with the "stop" block (stop and check/retry)
2017-01-26T10:45:15 <Bosmon> Well sure, but you recall that our current organisation of activities in the solutions registry is fucked up :)
2017-01-26T10:45:26 <Bosmon> There\'s no good basing our solution to the problem around what it does
2017-01-26T10:45:58 <Bosmon> You recall the end goal here - which is to be able to encode as a setting - whether a solution should be launched or not
2017-01-26T10:46:38 <Bosmon> So I\'m not quite sure what you mean by "an explicit launchHandler"
2017-01-26T10:46:38 <kasparnet> yeah, ok
2017-01-26T10:47:12 <kasparnet> well, so actually having every single entry in the solution registry explicitly have a block in their "settingshandlers" section
2017-01-26T10:47:14 <Bosmon> But certainly, what we require is something with the API of a settingsHandler, that encodes the action of launching and stopping
2017-01-26T10:47:41 <Bosmon> Such that when it receives a particular settings boolean "true" it causes launching, and when it receives "false" to cause stopping
2017-01-26T10:47:45 <kasparnet> yes, I agree that it\'s sensible to have that
2017-01-26T10:47:50 <Bosmon> But you\'re right that there would essentially be just a single one of these per OS
2017-01-26T10:47:54 <Bosmon> "mostly speaking"
2017-01-26T10:48:05 <Bosmon> Unless certain solutions required something special, which several on Windows actually do
2017-01-26T10:48:14 <kasparnet> like what?
2017-01-26T10:48:25 <Bosmon> Like the brilliant ones recently written by stegru :)
2017-01-26T10:48:26 <kasparnet> I mean, aren\'t their special needs encoded in the solutions registry already?
2017-01-26T10:48:33 <Bosmon> Yes they are
2017-01-26T10:48:34 <kasparnet> damn stegru
2017-01-26T10:48:39 <Bosmon> But they are encoded WRONGLY!
2017-01-26T10:48:41 <stegru> huh?
2017-01-26T10:48:42 <kasparnet> with his fancy windows code that actually works
2017-01-26T10:49:12 <kasparnet> hehe
2017-01-26T10:49:31 * kasparnet is browsing stegru\'s latest pulls
2017-01-26T10:49:59 <Bosmon> kasparnet - here\'s an example: https://github.com/GPII/windows/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/registeredAT/registeredAT.js#L76
2017-01-26T10:50:36 <Bosmon> Which we now encode in these stupid "start/stop" blocks
2017-01-26T10:50:38 <Bosmon> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L765
2017-01-26T10:50:53 <Bosmon> So the point of this revolution is that start/stop and isRunning will all die
2017-01-26T10:51:16 <Bosmon> And anything that was encoded in them will instead be encoded as settings
2017-01-26T10:52:06 <Bosmon> Interestingly I see that stegru doesn\'t actually have an explicit "isRunning" for this solution, instead relying on the impl of enableRegisteredAT to take up any slop
2017-01-26T10:52:22 <Bosmon> Well
2017-01-26T10:52:27 <Bosmon> It seems that no solutions have isRunning
2017-01-26T10:52:45 <Bosmon> Which makes me think that GPII-1230 is a bit "out of time"
2017-01-26T10:53:04 <Bosmon> That is, that it is time to axe "isRunning" before we have ever supported it : P
2017-01-26T10:53:40 <kasparnet> yeah - the isRunning is still in a pull request
2017-01-26T10:53:44 <Bosmon> ok
2017-01-26T10:53:47 <Bosmon> Good place for it :)
2017-01-26T10:54:54 <kasparnet> but... Killing the start/stop blocks, where should all the information about how to start and stop stuff go, such as: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L572-L583
2017-01-26T10:55:15 <kasparnet> where it\'s not a simple case of the same function retrieving a true or false parameter
2017-01-26T10:55:17 <Bosmon> kasparnet - it should go into "options" for the "launch settingsHandler"
2017-01-26T11:01:26 <kasparnet> Bosmon: I take it you dont mean like this: https://pad.gpii.net/p/2017-01-26-matchmaker-launch-handlers-jq54ni6
2017-01-26T11:02:47 <Bosmon> I guess a little bit like that
2017-01-26T11:03:41 <Bosmon> It\'s fascinating that the process we launch for JAWS isn\'t the same as the one we kill
2017-01-26T11:03:43 <kasparnet> but if that\'s the case, why have that information inside the settingshandler? Just because it\'s prettier?
2017-01-26T11:04:05 <Bosmon> kasparnet - I can refer you to the conversation we had with Sandrer etc. ONLY THE DAY BEFORE!
2017-01-26T11:04:21 <Bosmon> Where we explained that the journaller cannot restore the running state of an application because ITS RUNNING STATE IS NOT A SETTING
2017-01-26T11:04:30 * gtirloni joined the channel
2017-01-26T11:05:09 <stegru> i think it depends
2017-01-26T11:05:33 <Bosmon> So stegru\'s "enableRegisteredAT" function already in effect behaves like a settingsHandler
2017-01-26T11:06:05 <Bosmon> It\'s just that i) we encode the way to launch it in the funny way (start/stop) and ii) it has no corresponding way of reading whether the solution is running or not
2017-01-26T11:06:13 <kasparnet> Bosmon: well - but surely it would be the job of "gpii.launchHandlers.default" (in my example) to make the thing behave like a setting
2017-01-26T11:06:23 <kasparnet> and not the stuff inside "start" and "stop"
2017-01-26T11:06:28 <Bosmon> So in practice we\'d want to write an extra bit to take care of ii) and then wrap the thing in an API that agrees with the settingsHandler block
2017-01-26T11:06:35 <Bosmon> kasparnet - yes, it would
2017-01-26T11:06:56 <Bosmon> But the point is that we would axe the special blocks "start" and "stop" and all the associated code in the lifecycleManager that executes them
2017-01-26T11:07:07 <Bosmon> And instead rely on the standard "applySettings" loop
2017-01-26T11:07:58 <Bosmon> And the decision about whether things should be started or not is then signalled by the matchmaker by spitting out a boolean setting that sits in amongst all the other settings
2017-01-26T11:08:48 <kasparnet> yeah, ok - i guess it makes sense
2017-01-26T11:09:04 <kasparnet> :)
2017-01-26T11:09:09 <Bosmon> kasparnet - awesome!
2017-01-26T11:09:15 <Bosmon> Maybe I can go back to bed for another 2 hours then :)

2017-01-26T14:39:35 <Bosmon> Hi there Kasperent
2017-01-26T14:40:39 <kasparnet> hey Bosmon
2017-01-26T14:40:52 <Bosmon> What do you mean by "A separate block behaving like a settings handler"
2017-01-26T14:40:56 <Bosmon> Surely they *are* settings handlers :)
2017-01-26T14:41:21 <kasparnet> well... yes and no :)
2017-01-26T14:41:33 <kasparnet> settingshandlers take settings from the user NP sets as inputs
2017-01-26T14:41:51 <kasparnet> whereas the launchandlers takes a single boolean argument from the system
2017-01-26T14:42:08 <Bosmon> Well, hold it right there!
2017-01-26T14:42:15 <kasparnet> damnit
2017-01-26T14:42:24 <Bosmon> Aren\'t you making a false distinction between "the system" and "the user NP sets"
2017-01-26T14:42:24 <kasparnet> I should have thought more before saying that
2017-01-26T14:42:30 <kasparnet> :)
2017-01-26T14:42:34 <Bosmon> Surely both of them simply take input from the end of the matchmaking process
2017-01-26T14:42:40 <kasparnet> yeah
2017-01-26T14:42:54 <Bosmon> And the new, adjusted matchamaking process is going to fabricate extra settings
2017-01-26T14:43:00 <Bosmon> Corresponding to all the old "isRunning" states
2017-01-26T14:43:12 <kasparnet> yeah
2017-01-26T14:43:24 <kasparnet> that makes sense
2017-01-26T14:44:14 <kasparnet> but my point from question on L2 was more in terms of whether we need to put them in seperate sections in the solutions registry
2017-01-26T14:44:16 <kasparnet> separate*
2017-01-26T14:44:32 <Bosmon> separate sections in the solutions registry.........
2017-01-26T14:44:35 <Bosmon> Separate how?
2017-01-26T14:44:38 <kasparnet> since we allow the user to reference stuff from the "configure" and "restore" blocks
2017-01-26T14:44:48 <kasparnet> or rather, they can reference settingshandler blocks
2017-01-26T14:44:49 <Bosmon> Yeah
2017-01-26T14:44:57 <Bosmon> Well, these *are* settingsHandler blocks
2017-01-26T14:45:01 <Bosmon> As we continue to insist : P
2017-01-26T14:45:41 <kasparnet> so what happens if a user references a "i\'ll launch and application" style settingshandler block from within configure/restore
2017-01-26T14:47:05 <Bosmon> I can\'t see how there need be any difference
2017-01-26T14:47:09 <Bosmon> But perhaps I\'m missing something
2017-01-26T14:47:37 <Bosmon> From the point of view of the solutions registry, the settingsHandlers which correspond to "former launches" should be treated identically
2017-01-26T14:47:42 <Bosmon> Since that is the whole point of this rewrite
2017-01-26T14:48:56 <kasparnet> ok - so looking in the configure block for JAWS in the pad
2017-01-26T14:49:06 <kasparnet> what do we do if the user writes something like that?
2017-01-26T14:49:18 <Bosmon> WE LET THEM DO IT
2017-01-26T14:49:25 <kasparnet> WHHHHAAAAATTTTTT??????
2017-01-26T14:49:32 <Bosmon> Well how are we going to prevent them :)
2017-01-26T14:49:38 <Bosmon> They could write any old rubbish in a solutions entry
