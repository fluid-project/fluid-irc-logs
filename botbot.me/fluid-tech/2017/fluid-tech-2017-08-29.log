2017-08-29T14:19:58 <gtirloni> clown: could you try adding \'ok to test\' again in that gpii/linux PR?

2017-08-29T14:38:07 <clown> that is, your "ok to test" triggered it.

2017-08-29T14:38:22 <clown> not mine :-(
2017-08-29T14:39:32 <gtirloni> let\'s keep an eye on this... i\'ll reconfigure all jobs. if next time your \'ok to test\' doesn\'t work, please let me know
2017-08-29T14:39:52 <gtirloni> sorry about this.. /me looks disapprovingly at jenkins
2017-08-29T14:45:35 <clown> okay gtirloni, will do.  Thanks for triggering the jobs. /me says "tsk tsk" in jenkins direction.
2017-08-29T14:45:42 <gtirloni> :)
