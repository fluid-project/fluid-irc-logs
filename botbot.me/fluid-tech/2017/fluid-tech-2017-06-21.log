2017-06-21T15:46:37 <mrtyler> gtirloni: i took a crack at our entries in the planning spreadsheet
2017-06-21T15:46:57 <mrtyler> please add your comments, and/or we can talk about this more next week
2017-06-21T15:47:35 <mrtyler> btw i did the reliability too because even tho it says "TBD" until they hire a contractor, i\'m sure we are the most knowledgeable about that topic
2017-06-21T15:48:53 <gtirloni> cool, thanks. i\'ll take a look later today

2017-06-21T16:56:05 <gtirloni> added a bunch of comments in the gist too
2017-06-21T16:57:05 <gtirloni> but overall the vagrant.yml file seemed pretty simple (maybe all those tedious docker commands could be in a high-level abstraction provided by the vmenv plugin but I\'d avoid increasing the complexity right now... too many moving parts to change as is)
