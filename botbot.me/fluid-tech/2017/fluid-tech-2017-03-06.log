2017-03-06T15:16:38 <cindyli> alanharnum: do you have a second for a chart authoring graph question?
2017-03-06T15:17:00 <alanharnum> cindyli: sure, should I hop on Vidyo?
2017-03-06T15:17:06 <cindyli> yes, please, alanharnum
2017-03-06T15:17:49 <alanharnum> cindyli: my room is open
2017-03-06T15:23:23 <simonjb> cindyli: alanharnum\'s computer crashed
2017-03-06T15:23:32 <simonjb> he will be back
2017-03-06T15:23:41 <cindyli> thanks for letting me know, simonjb

2017-03-06T16:09:46 <cindyli> alanharnum: the place i found for the area opacity is at https://github.com/fluid-project/chartAuthoring/blob/master/src/js/lineChartTimeSeriesArea.js#L98
2017-03-06T16:10:09 <cindyli> but changing it doesn\'t affect the opacity. am i looking at the right place, alanharnum?
2017-03-06T16:51:39 <alanharnum> cindyli: having a look now...
2017-03-06T16:51:55 <cindyli> thanks, alanharnum
2017-03-06T16:56:07 <alanharnum> cindyli - it is possible the opacity is being overridden by CSS. opacity can be set on the SVG element itself (that\'s what https://github.com/fluid-project/chartAuthoring/blob/master/src/js/lineChartTimeSeriesArea.js#L98 does), but it will be overridden if there\'s a style sheet
2017-03-06T16:56:18 <alanharnum> which there is for the front end demo you\'re working with
2017-03-06T16:56:31 <cindyli> ok, i will check, thanks, alanharnum

2017-03-06T16:57:09 <cindyli> cool. thanks, alanharnum
2017-03-06T16:57:27 <alanharnum> your best bet is probably to make a specific class for the CI metrics so you can override the "default" CSS

2017-03-06T18:01:56 <amatas> alanharnum, mrtyler, it seems that Avtar and Gio are missing today, what do you think about moving the ops meeting to other day?
2017-03-06T18:05:38 <mrtyler> decision: we\'ll reschedule. i\'ll make a doodle and email it
2017-03-06T18:20:53 <cindyli> alanharnum: when using floe.chartAuthoring.lineChart.timeSeriesMultiDataSet to draw multiple lines for multiple data sets on one chart, from what i read, all lines are drawn with the same color, which is the first array element defined at options.lineOptions.colors.
2017-03-06T18:21:17 <cindyli> it cannot draw lines in different colors for different data sets, is that right?
2017-03-06T18:24:26 <alanharnum> cindyli: by default it will draw a different color line for each data set - let me find the relevant line in the code
2017-03-06T18:24:45 <cindyli> thanks
2017-03-06T18:25:07 <alanharnum> cindyli: https://github.com/fluid-project/chartAuthoring/blob/master/src/js/lineChartTimeSeriesLine.js#L104

2017-03-06T18:26:16 <alanharnum> cindyli: within chartAuthoring itself on the lineChart tests, if you remove interpolation: "step" and the area grade in the test grade definition, you\'ll see it draws multiple coloured lines
2017-03-06T18:26:46 <cindyli> alanharnum: i\'m using interpolation: "step"
2017-03-06T18:27:32 <alanharnum> cindyli: sorry - that shouldn\'t matter. if you remove the fill area you should see that it draws each line in a different color.
2017-03-06T18:27:45 <alanharnum> if this is within the dashboard it\'s possible that CSS is overriding this
2017-03-06T18:27:50 <cindyli> yes, i removed the area grade, all lines are in the same color
2017-03-06T18:27:56 <alanharnum> let me take a look
2017-03-06T18:27:59 <cindyli> checking css..
2017-03-06T18:29:03 <alanharnum> cindyli: https://github.com/cindyli/qi-dashboard-frontend-demo/blob/master/demos/src/css/qi-frontend-panels.css#L59
2017-03-06T18:30:01 <cindyli> yay! thanks, that makes the difference, alanharnum
2017-03-06T18:30:26 <alanharnum> since this has come up twice, I wonder where the best place to put some comments / documentation about visual styling of the chartAuthoring elements is - I think it is confusing to have it configurable on the component like this, but overridden by CSS
2017-03-06T18:30:39 <alanharnum> but it\'s necessary to do some things on the component for logic like having dynamically generated colour scales
2017-03-06T18:30:48 <cindyli> agree
2017-03-06T18:30:59 <alanharnum> or to have that option
2017-03-06T18:48:37 <alanharnum> cindyli: https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLOE-499
2017-03-06T18:49:09 <cindyli> thanks for creating a jira for it, alanharnum
2017-03-06T18:49:36 <alanharnum> no problem - if i can\'t make it easier for you to use right now i can at least document the issue so it can be addressed later
