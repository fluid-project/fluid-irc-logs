2017-08-02T13:48:20 <Justin_o> colinclark, Bosmon: so that onboundary event issue, turned out to be a bug in my code... but it's worth noting that there are voices that may not support it
2017-08-02T13:49:39 <Bosmon> Justin_o - cool - sounds like those are voices which we need not support for our first version of the tool :)
2017-08-02T13:49:56 <colinclark> phew, good news Justin_o
2017-08-02T13:50:14 <Justin_o> Bosmon: seems like the default ones are supporting it on my machine. I'm trying to update my windows vm now to try it out there

2017-08-02T14:23:44 <amatas> hi avtar
2017-08-02T14:23:57 <avtar> i just saw your jira comment about gitlab ee licensing
2017-08-02T14:24:18 <avtar> that fubaring is on me
2017-08-02T14:25:06 <avtar> i created an account for myself in a brain haze, then realized that we were going to use a shared account, deleted mine, and then pinged for the shared credentials
2017-08-02T14:25:38 <avtar> i didn't think gitlab still counts deleted accounts as active users
2017-08-02T14:26:05 <amatas> well I also hope so
2017-08-02T14:27:25 <avtar> sorry about the mess :(
2017-08-02T14:27:37 <amatas> no worries
