2017-03-02T15:42:46 <mrtyler_> gtirloni: amatas: my vidyo room is open (i think)
2017-03-02T15:43:05 <amatas> ok
2017-03-02T15:43:11 <mrtyler_> we haven\'t really discussed how to approach this but a quick question: to both of you have access to a deck of playing cards? :)
2017-03-02T15:43:17 <mrtyler_> do both of you*
2017-03-02T15:43:44 <amatas> pocker cards are ok?
2017-03-02T15:44:21 <mrtyler_> poker? yes
2017-03-02T15:44:30 <amatas> https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=artarmin.android.scrum.poker&hl=es
2017-03-02T15:44:35 <mrtyler_> anything with numbers. i\'m going to suggest that we play
2017-03-02T15:44:38 <mrtyler_> yeah you got it :)
2017-03-02T15:45:13 <mrtyler_> have you done planning poker before? if so, did you find it useful?
2017-03-02T15:46:18 <amatas> yes, in my last job we used that app in our mobile phones to estimate the effort of the tasks
2017-03-02T15:46:33 <amatas> yes I find it useful
2017-03-02T15:47:21 <amatas> overall when someone say a number too high or too low than the rest, and it\'s because there is another point of view of the task
2017-03-02T15:47:33 <mrtyler_> yes
2017-03-02T15:47:46 <mrtyler_> so i\'m going to suggest we try planning poker here
2017-03-02T15:49:05 <gtirloni> i have never worked with tshirt sizing, poker planning or using cards for that so i\'m a newbie in all that
2017-03-02T15:49:15 <mrtyler_> great we\'ll teach you :)
2017-03-02T15:50:08 <gtirloni> ok. i\'m joining the room in a moment
2017-03-02T15:50:29 <mrtyler_> np, we\'re early

2017-03-02T16:33:42 <stegru> yo
2017-03-02T16:33:51 <stegru> I forgot what I wanted, jhernandez
2017-03-02T16:34:00 <stegru> oh! yes..
2017-03-02T16:35:02 <stegru> what would be the best way to fix those unit tests, in terms of using git... shall I take your branch then push it to you, or what?
2017-03-02T16:35:16 <stegru> i\'m crap at this
2017-03-02T16:35:21 <jhernandez> haha
2017-03-02T16:35:25 <jhernandez> don\'t worry
2017-03-02T16:35:30 <stegru> i\'m not :)
2017-03-02T16:35:37 <jhernandez> xDDD
2017-03-02T16:37:35 <jhernandez> okay, you can push your changes into your windows repo
2017-03-02T16:39:04 <jhernandez> and then, you can make my gpii-app/pull/8 depending on your windows branch
2017-03-02T16:40:05 <jhernandez> you can reproduce the problem by running the tests with vagrant\'s winrm plugin
2017-03-02T16:41:35 <jhernandez> this is, running vagrant winrm -c "do.ps1 -c \'npm test\'"

2017-03-02T16:44:40 <stegru> oh
2017-03-02T16:45:04 <stegru> yes that\'s ok jhernandez thanks
2017-03-02T16:46:02 <jhernandez> stegru: yw :)

2017-03-02T20:49:29 <alanharnum> https://blog.docker.com/2017/03/docker-enterprise-edition/ - "Today we are announcing Docker Enterprise Edition (EE), a new version of the Docker platform optimized for business-critical deployments... For consistency, we are also renaming the free Docker products to Docker Community Edition (CE) and adopting a new lifecycle and time-based versioning scheme for both Docker EE and CE. Today\xe2\x80\x99s Docker CE and EE 17.03 re
2017-03-02T20:49:29 <alanharnum> lease is the first to use the new scheme."
2017-03-02T20:52:31 <mrtyler_> what\'s next, Docker Beans?
2017-03-02T20:52:50 <mrtyler_> Docker Servlet Pages?
2017-03-02T20:53:33 <alanharnum> hahahaha
2017-03-02T21:39:45 <gtirloni> their EE version will have 1 year of support.. that\'s not exactly "LTS" in my book, but given they can\'t seem to release versions that won\'t completely break everything, I think even 1 year might be too much for them
2017-03-02T21:41:01 <gtirloni> EE Basic also has less feature than CE + Docker Hub (missing image security scanning -- which they can\'t really make EE-only because CoreOS/Quay is offering that too)
2017-03-02T21:42:16 <gtirloni> looking forward to see how they will play this game. they must be getting pressured for more revenue (the CE/EE split always existed, right? but it seems that wasn\'t making them much money.. otherwise, why change?)
2017-03-02T22:27:17 <mrtyler_> gtirloni: are you still here?
2017-03-02T22:27:30 <mrtyler_> i have a quick (hopefully) ansible question
2017-03-02T22:27:35 <gtirloni> mrtyler_: hi!
2017-03-02T22:27:58 <mrtyler_> i was hoping to have this in a more digestible form but i wanted to catch you before you go off to play with cats or w/e
2017-03-02T22:28:34 <mrtyler_> i\'m trying to match some json \'"foo": "bar"\' in a playbook but i\'m having trouble with the quoting
2017-03-02T22:28:58 <mrtyler_> my nebulous question is: how do i go about debugging this?
2017-03-02T22:29:15 <mrtyler_> i know about debug: msg: but it\'s crude, obviously. is there a debugger or some kind of trace mode or some trick i should know about?
2017-03-02T22:29:52 <mrtyler_> if you don\'t have anything short and simple, that\'s fine, i\'ll just bang on it some more
2017-03-02T22:30:08 <gtirloni> not that i know of... it\'s very limited in debugging capabilities. if you want to share a code snippet i can take a look
2017-03-02T22:30:34 <mrtyler_> let\'s see if i can highlight a useful part
2017-03-02T22:30:36 <gtirloni> (they seem to have spent some time focusing on improving the error messages, but those are still far from explaining the whole story sometimes)
2017-03-02T22:32:53 <mrtyler_> https://gist.github.com/mrtyler/25218e61e1b0eec06d0b58accf4ba3af#file-configure-yml-L22-L23
2017-03-02T22:33:46 <mrtyler_> i\'ve tried quite a few variants of quotes and double quotes and backslashes
2017-03-02T22:34:11 <mrtyler_> which is fine, i\'ve literally been solving this kind of problem for my entire career
2017-03-02T22:34:23 <gtirloni> hehehe
2017-03-02T22:34:27 <mrtyler_> it would just be nice if i could see what ansible thinks things look like
2017-03-02T22:34:45 <mrtyler_> i think my workaround might be "just use shell: ... | grep"
2017-03-02T22:35:04 <gtirloni> i think you may try this:   \'{{ influxdb_datasource|to_json }} not in {{ datasources.json }}"
2017-03-02T22:35:25 <mrtyler_> uh that\'s unbalanced
2017-03-02T22:35:31 <mrtyler_> i guess last one is \'
2017-03-02T22:35:32 <gtirloni> the ansible vs. jinja2 interaction isn\'t always clear
2017-03-02T22:35:50 <mrtyler_> right, the extra layer
2017-03-02T22:35:59 <gtirloni> maybe you\'ll need to quote the first variable "\'{{ influxdb_datasource|to_json }}\' but not the second one.. it\'s hard to say with the filter
2017-03-02T22:36:10 <mrtyler_> right
2017-03-02T22:36:12 <gtirloni> yeah, last one would be \', sorry
2017-03-02T22:36:13 <mrtyler_> well i\'ll play with it
2017-03-02T22:37:05 <gtirloni> also, ansible doesn\'t let you use 100% of jinja2.. so things like {% %} probably won\'t work.. they would let you do more elaborated tests
2017-03-02T22:37:30 <gtirloni> but i\'m thinking .. putting datasources.json in between {{ }} might fix it
2017-03-02T22:38:01 <mrtyler_> heh, here\'s the first awesome error message
2017-03-02T22:38:03 <gtirloni> or even something like this: "\'{{  influxdb_datasource|to_json }}\' not in \'{{ datasources.json }}\'"
2017-03-02T22:38:04 <mrtyler_> The conditional check \'{{ influxdb_datasource|to_json }} not in {{ datasources.json }}\' failed. The error was: Unexpected templating type error occurred on ({{ influxdb_datasource|to_json }} not in {{ datasources.json }}): Undefined is not JSON serializable
2017-03-02T22:38:27 <mrtyler_> i think that\'s an improvement actually
2017-03-02T22:38:47 <gtirloni> yeah, does influxdb_datasource has anything? here the debug thing would help
2017-03-02T22:39:01 <mrtyler_> oh right, that\'s from an earlier thing
2017-03-02T22:39:06 <mrtyler_> see this is why i wanted to have this cleaned up first
2017-03-02T22:39:11 <mrtyler_> anyway, thanks for the ideas
2017-03-02T22:39:31 <mrtyler_> i think i\'m on a better track now :)
2017-03-02T22:39:53 <mrtyler_> this is also the last problem to solve, i think
2017-03-02T22:40:29 <gtirloni> cool :)
