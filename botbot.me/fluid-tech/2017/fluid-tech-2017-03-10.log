2017-03-10T16:55:49 <alanharnum> ^ colinclark as well, ifinterested
2017-03-10T16:57:11 <colinclark> i\'m certainly interested
2017-03-10T16:57:15 <colinclark> i have pretty bad wifi here at the moment
2017-03-10T16:57:51 <simonjb> alanharnum, colinclark: I need to grab some lunch, but otherwise am available
2017-03-10T16:58:10 <alanharnum> simonjb colinclark: OK, why don\'t we aim for like 1:00?
2017-03-10T16:58:18 <simonjb> good for me
2017-03-10T16:58:32 <colinclark> I will probably be at dinner then :)
2017-03-10T16:58:59 <colinclark> but if you want to go ahead without me, that\'s totally cool
2017-03-10T16:59:13 <alanharnum> colinclark: you can check out the repo https://github.com/waharnum/sensorPlayer
2017-03-10T16:59:35 <alanharnum> I actually vaguely learned how to use flocking!
2017-03-10T17:00:48 <simonjb> I can grab something quickly if we want to chat sooner
2017-03-10T17:00:57 * alanharnum now sort of understands sine waveforms, the "Hello, World!" of sound synthesis
2017-03-10T17:01:24 <alanharnum> if anyone else is as ignorant of what audio synthesis terms actually mean, I found this introduction very helpful: http://beausievers.com/synth/synthbasics/#basicwaveforms
2017-03-10T17:01:31 <simonjb> I\'ll go get food now in case...
2017-03-10T17:02:53 <colinclark> that\'s awesome, alanharnum :)
2017-03-10T17:04:35 <colinclark> Here, alanharnum, you should use "0.2.0-dev.20170206T221943Z.fb09a52": https://github.com/waharnum/sensorPlayer/blob/master/package.json#L5
2017-03-10T17:04:52 <colinclark> for a bit more stability :)
2017-03-10T17:06:12 * kasparnet has quit
2017-03-10T17:06:55 <colinclark> interesting approach for sonifying the sensors
2017-03-10T17:07:41 <alanharnum> colinclark: it\'s basically the easiest thing to get working
2017-03-10T17:07:48 <alanharnum> i\'m not wedded to it conceptually
2017-03-10T17:08:15 <colinclark> Here, I\'d recommnd you go ahead and use Bergson for scheduling changes: https://github.com/waharnum/sensorPlayer/blob/master/src/sensorPlayer.js#L140-L156
2017-03-10T17:08:32 <colinclark> funny things happen when you try to schedule stuff with setTimeout or setInterval
2017-03-10T17:08:45 <colinclark> https://github.com/colinbdclark/bergson
2017-03-10T17:09:06 <colinclark> the-t-in-rtf and will be proud of me for having comprehensive documentation and unit tests for Bergson
2017-03-10T17:09:38 <alanharnum> yeah, I rolled the gradual tone change behaviour really fast this morning while thinking "colinclark will tell me to refactor this to use Bergson" :)
2017-03-10T17:09:42 <colinclark> hahaha
2017-03-10T17:09:46 <colinclark> sorry :(
2017-03-10T17:09:56 <colinclark> I\'m too predictable
2017-03-10T17:09:57 <colinclark> I *think*, alanharnum, that you\'ll be able to to remove all this code
2017-03-10T17:09:58 <colinclark> and just boil it down to some JSON :)
2017-03-10T17:10:03 <colinclark> but we\'ll see
2017-03-10T17:10:46 <alanharnum> no the advice is corrext
2017-03-10T17:10:55 <alanharnum> corrext = xtra correct
2017-03-10T17:11:02 <alanharnum> this was a really fast spike
2017-03-10T17:11:08 <alanharnum> yeah I was reading about filters this morning
2017-03-10T17:11:15 <colinclark> Totally
2017-03-10T17:11:26 <alanharnum> and thinking "I can probably do the gradual tone using a filter or similar"
2017-03-10T17:11:47 <colinclark> yes, you might be able to
2017-03-10T17:12:17 <colinclark> my impression is that, without thinking through it very clearly, you\'ll probably want to use more unit generators and less manual scheduling of value changes
2017-03-10T17:12:40 <alanharnum> and a number of the things being done can probably be done using transform specs instead
2017-03-10T17:12:52 <alanharnum> converting the sensor range into frequency range, FE
2017-03-10T17:12:56 * kasparnet joined the channel
2017-03-10T17:13:10 <colinclark> I\'m excited you\'re working on this
2017-03-10T17:13:19 <colinclark> I only wish we had Signaletic now
2017-03-10T17:13:36 <colinclark> but we\'ll get there
2017-03-10T17:14:35 <alanharnum> this may be a chance to think about what Signaletic should provide in terms of features
2017-03-10T17:15:03 <alanharnum> the ascending/descending frequency sensor sonification case turns out (at least code-wise) to be conceptually pretty simple
2017-03-10T17:15:11 <alanharnum> especially with the model-based synths flocking provides
2017-03-10T17:15:42 <colinclark> My hope is that Signaletic will provide what you might see as NO FEATURES :)
2017-03-10T17:15:59 <colinclark> It seems to me that there\'s a lot here in terms of scaling and normalizing data
2017-03-10T17:16:07 <colinclark> all of which needs to eventually be declarative
2017-03-10T17:16:18 <colinclark> and which would belong properly in a layer above Signaletic
2017-03-10T17:16:34 <colinclark> or beside, I suppose :)
2017-03-10T17:16:51 <alanharnum> yeah I think all this could be done in JSON, possibly with out of the box Infusion transforms
2017-03-10T17:16:58 <colinclark> yep, it probably could
2017-03-10T17:17:16 <colinclark> at some point it might risk performance issues today, which is why Signaletic, despite offering no features, will help a lot
2017-03-10T17:17:31 <colinclark> since garbage pressure on the main thread won\'t threaten your beautiful sine waves
2017-03-10T17:18:23 <colinclark> anyway, I\'ll clone your repository and contemplate it some more this evening
2017-03-10T17:19:53 <simonjb> alanharnum, colinclark, I\'m back with food and can meet any time
2017-03-10T17:19:53 * kasparnet has quit
2017-03-10T17:21:47 <colinclark> i could meet now, before going for dinner
2017-03-10T17:21:53 <colinclark> if it\'s convenient for you, alanharnum
2017-03-10T17:22:13 <alanharnum> colinclark: let\'s chat quick - it would be good to think about next steps to make this work with the Nexus
2017-03-10T17:22:43 <alanharnum> fwiw i can happily throw all this code away - it\'s definitely a spike mostly aimed at increasing my own understanding / thinking about the sensor synthesis
2017-03-10T17:22:54 <alanharnum> opened my room
