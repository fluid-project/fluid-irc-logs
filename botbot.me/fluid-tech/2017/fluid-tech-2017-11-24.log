2017-11-24T18:09:28 <alanharnum> from "the future is here, just not widely distributed" (at least in potential vaporware form): http://www.youbionic.com/store/double-hand
2017-11-24T18:16:19 <gmoss> alanharnum: i think potential vaporware is right, but still a neat project :) I wonder what the use-case of a double-hand would be. A few other things that come to mind: Is the grasping control of each hand controlled by a single finger? in which case, is it capable only of a single motion? is there haptic feedback to the controlling finger (I have my doubts on this one)?
2017-11-24T18:16:58 <alanharnum> gmoss: it looks like it basically "mirrors" your single hand motions
2017-11-24T18:17:21 <alanharnum> there\'s a number of videos on http://www.youbionic.com/new-page/

2017-11-24T18:23:05 <gmoss> oh yes thank you, that\'s what I was looking for. Their youtube page has no publicly listed videos, despite being linked on their website. the "shadow mode" demonstration seems to be the same motions as the "hand flex sensor control" demonstration, except that the user happens to do the things that the mechanical hand will be doing, so it looks snazzy
2017-11-24T18:23:40 <gmoss> full disclosure: I am a skeptic and a cynic. all the same, this is very neat stuff!
