2017-09-05T16:27:11 <michelled> hi Bosmon, I\'m still having issues with getting those tests to run :(
2017-09-05T16:27:33 <michelled> I merged in your branch and implemented the promise we talked about
2017-09-05T16:27:43 <Bosmon> Hi there michelled
2017-09-05T16:29:55 <Bosmon> Looks like it is still the same failure: 07:20:05.183:  Test case listener has not responded after 5000ms - at sequence pos 2 of 11 sequence element {
2017-09-05T16:29:55 <Bosmon> "event": "{that gpii.app.menu}.events.onCreate",
2017-09-05T16:30:57 <Bosmon> https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/pull/17/files#diff-bd9c9dcd314f2d7df52935b3a6a4d504R91 - you probably can\'t invoke console.log this way
2017-09-05T16:31:02 <Bosmon> On most architectures it is "this-ist"
2017-09-05T16:31:10 <Bosmon> Although this isn\'t your problem
2017-09-05T16:32:55 <Bosmon> I imagine your problem is that app.on("ready") has exactly the same problem that you do: https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/pull/17/files#diff-bd9c9dcd314f2d7df52935b3a6a4d504R137
2017-09-05T16:33:57 <Bosmon> Also, if this ever did start up as desired, you would trigger a further failure by attempting to resolve the promise twice
2017-09-05T16:34:57 <Bosmon> So perhaps you are just being saved from a fatal global exception by the fact that app.on("ready") only ever fires once anyway
2017-09-05T16:35:38 <Bosmon> The point of the promise is that not only must the promise have the same globality as the app, its firer must as well
2017-09-05T16:36:13 <Bosmon> You must call gpii.app.appReady.resolve at most once in the entire session

2017-09-05T16:58:45 <michelled> I\'m not understanding. I think \'resolve\' is only happening once but the \'then\' on the promise would happen twice when I run both sets of tests.
2017-09-05T16:59:33 <michelled> also, would this explain why the tests hang even when I only have one set of the tests running? The code I committed has only the production config tests enabled.
2017-09-05T17:08:48 <michelled> Bosmon: when you say that the console.log won\'t work - do you mean it would print at the wrong time? Because I\'m certainly seeing those log messages printed to the console
2017-09-05T17:16:35 <Bosmon> michelled - ok, I guess the electron console is nonstandard
2017-09-05T17:16:42 <Bosmon> It wouldn\'t surprise me, so much is wonky in that environment
2017-09-05T17:17:31 <Bosmon> michelled - yes, I think we can explain why the tests hang in all environments, in that you are simply always missing the ready event
2017-09-05T17:17:38 <Bosmon> It fires once per session, and I think you always miss it
2017-09-05T17:17:39 <colinclark> It used to be so much more non-standard in older versions, back when they had a consolidated console for both the Chromium side and the Node.js process
2017-09-05T17:17:46 <colinclark> very wonky back then
2017-09-05T17:18:01 <Bosmon> Hey there colinclark - welcome back :)
