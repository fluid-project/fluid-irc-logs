2017-01-31T20:04:16 <gtirloni> i think this is the biggest discussion i\'ve ever seen on monorepo  vs. multiple repos -- https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/24343
2017-01-31T20:22:20 <gloob> who wins?
2017-01-31T20:34:08 <gtirloni> still undecided!
2017-01-31T20:37:58 <gloob> we should use labels in github
2017-01-31T20:38:10 <gloob> love this one https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/labels/team%2Fux%20%28deprecated%20-%20do%20not%20use%29
2017-01-31T20:38:55 * kasparne_ joined the channel
2017-01-31T20:39:54 <gtirloni> i\'m trying to remember why that is so
2017-01-31T20:40:03 <gtirloni> i think github moves from teams to roles, or vice-versa
2017-01-31T20:40:33 <gtirloni> and there was a mapping in place.. and when they went to roles (or teams), there was a cleanup of old/deprecated names.. and i\'m guessing they updated the labels too
2017-01-31T20:40:46 <gtirloni> i think that was it. or not.

2017-01-31T20:43:30 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-01-31T20:44:02 <gloob> well, I love the label text
2017-01-31T20:44:03 <gloob> that one
2017-01-31T20:44:35 <gloob> well, I have 12 electrons process in my windows 10 machine
2017-01-31T20:44:49 <gloob> gg: how to detect I\'m running electron
2017-01-31T20:45:47 <colinclark> gloob: The GPII app you mean?
2017-01-31T20:45:51 <gloob> yes
2017-01-31T20:45:55 <colinclark> If so, I believe stegru has done this work
2017-01-31T20:46:07 <gloob> do you know the reference of that?
2017-01-31T20:46:18 <stegru> it\'s half done
2017-01-31T20:46:27 <colinclark> "is doing"
2017-01-31T20:46:29 <gloob> ah ok, work in progredd
2017-01-31T20:46:30 <gloob> sure
2017-01-31T20:46:31 <gloob> sure
2017-01-31T20:46:32 <colinclark> that\'s what I meant :P
2017-01-31T20:46:32 <colinclark> :)
2017-01-31T20:46:37 <gloob> stegru: which issue is?
2017-01-31T20:47:02 <stegru> 2235
2017-01-31T20:48:07 <stegru> oh wait, i think you\'re talking about something different
2017-01-31T20:48:43 <gloob> although you can create threads in electron, vscode have several instances
2017-01-31T20:49:07 <gloob> stegru: it\'s related
2017-01-31T20:49:15 <gloob> stegru: but, yes it is not exactly the same
2017-01-31T20:49:30 <gloob> probably gpii-app should know about their own existence too
2017-01-31T20:49:46 <gloob> I currently don\'t know if we can share the implementation
2017-01-31T20:49:48 <gloob> hope so!
2017-01-31T20:50:26 <stegru> for the gpii-app, would this be enough? if (gpii.app) { eletron } else { not election }
2017-01-31T20:50:46 <gloob> what is gpii.app?
2017-01-31T20:51:09 <gloob> is_process_running(gpii-app)?
2017-01-31T20:51:16 <stegru> it\'s something that the electron app defines
2017-01-31T20:51:31 <gloob> a flag somewhere?
2017-01-31T20:51:47 <stegru> no, it\'s the namespace used by the app
2017-01-31T20:51:54 <stegru> in app.js
2017-01-31T20:52:00 <gloob> ah, I see
2017-01-31T20:52:19 <gloob> well, the problem it is that I\'m launching a isolated .exe binary
2017-01-31T20:52:40 <gloob> with their own node and universal and gpii-windows and half of the npm libraries of internet
2017-01-31T20:53:07 <stegru> ok
2017-01-31T20:53:28 <stegru> can\'t you inspect process.argv[0]?
2017-01-31T20:53:34 <gloob> sure, probably
2017-01-31T20:53:48 <gloob> something like am_I_running?
2017-01-31T20:54:14 <gloob> if yes, exit
2017-01-31T20:54:34 <stegru> sorry, i\'m not sure what you want
2017-01-31T20:54:37 <gloob> I will add additional information in the issue
2017-01-31T20:54:41 <stegru> ok
2017-01-31T20:54:44 <gloob> because it seems like two in one
2017-01-31T20:55:21 <gloob> stegru: vale?
2017-01-31T20:56:01 <stegru> at the moment, the code for 2235 just performs the checks.. there still needs to be something (in the electron app) that calls it and presents a message like "already running", or just die
2017-01-31T20:57:43 <gloob> ok, I can do that
2017-01-31T20:57:50 <gloob> tomorrow
2017-01-31T20:57:52 <stegru> go on, then
