2017-01-25T12:04:56 <gloob> kasparnet: hi, you around?
2017-01-25T12:17:08 <kasparnet> hey gloob
2017-01-25T12:43:56 <gloob> kasparnet: hi, I was checking some preferences against the mm and find that if I mix common term with application specific terms, the system doesn\'t add the app specific terms, in example https://github.com/gloob/gpii-settings/blob/master/AT-Tools/JAWS/preferences/JAWS-PrefSet_A.json
2017-01-25T12:44:13 <gloob> it seems it only applies the common terms, maybe I need to declare a block for the commons terms?
2017-01-25T12:44:42 <gloob> I didn\'t trace it yet, I wanted to check with you if you know something about, before start tracing it
2017-01-25T13:00:51 <kasparnet> hi gloob
2017-01-25T13:01:08 <kasparnet> it should indeed mix them - with the application specific terms being prioritized
2017-01-25T13:02:50 * kasparnet is looking for examples
2017-01-25T13:09:18 <kasparnet> gloob: ... hmmm, I\'m actually not able to find any tests that are checking it - though I feel I must be looking in the wrong places, since I was quite sure that it\'s implemented and tested
2017-01-25T13:12:58 <gloob> kasparnet: so, that json should work?
2017-01-25T13:13:03 <gloob> is it the syntax ok?
2017-01-25T13:15:07 <kasparnet> yeah, it looks correct
2017-01-25T13:15:29 <gloob> kasparnet: ok, so I will trace it to provide more information then, thanks!
2017-01-25T13:15:31 <kasparnet> perhaps to double check, try removing the common terms from the NP set
2017-01-25T13:15:42 <kasparnet> and see if the application specific settings are applied
2017-01-25T13:15:43 <gloob> kasparnet: yes, I will
2017-01-25T13:16:04 <gloob> kasparnet: and if they are not applied? where to check
2017-01-25T13:16:26 <kasparnet> first in the solutions registry
2017-01-25T13:16:36 <kasparnet> they should be listed in the solutions registry
2017-01-25T13:17:27 <kasparnet> (this doesn\'t always apply --- but since JAWS has its settings spread across two files, they need to be explicitly stated at the relevant settingshandler for the system to know where to write the settings)
2017-01-25T13:19:33 <kasparnet> gloob: so either here: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L17-L24
2017-01-25T13:19:51 <kasparnet> or here: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L159-L189
2017-01-25T13:20:12 <gloob> ok, that two file are on my radar there days :D
2017-01-25T13:20:33 <gloob> files, these
2017-01-25T13:20:38 <kasparnet> :D
2017-01-25T13:20:46 <kasparnet> yeah - so I just looked through the solutions registry
2017-01-25T13:21:05 <kasparnet> and it turns out none of the three settings you have in the NP set are listed there
2017-01-25T13:21:24 <kasparnet> so to get things to working, you need to add the setting name in the relevant section
2017-01-25T13:21:46 <kasparnet> (you dont need capabilities transformations or anything - just need it to be listed under supportedSettings)
2017-01-25T13:21:54 <kasparnet> and then things should work as expected
2017-01-25T13:23:12 <gloob> ah, you mean the app-specific ones?
2017-01-25T13:23:30 <gloob> so there\'s some kind of whitelisting
2017-01-25T13:26:19 <stegru> gloob, the "supportedSettings" block is used when there\'s is more than 1 "configuration" block in a solution. it\'s used to tell it which configuration block the option is in
2017-01-25T13:27:30 * Justin_o joined the channel
2017-01-25T13:29:41 <gloob> so they are exclusive
2017-01-25T13:29:55 <stegru> https://github.com/stegru/universal/blob/GPII-2052/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L346
2017-01-25T13:30:04 <gloob> or is in one block or in another, there isn\'t a competition
2017-01-25T13:30:19 <stegru> er
2017-01-25T13:30:40 <stegru> it\'s in the block you say it is
2017-01-25T13:31:15 <gloob> stegru: yes, that\'s about SR/SH
2017-01-25T13:31:22 <gloob> stegru: I\'m talking about a preferences definition
2017-01-25T13:31:59 <gloob> I mean, what happens if I define same term with a common-term and a specific-app term
2017-01-25T13:32:11 <stegru> ok, i don\'t know
2017-01-25T13:32:19 <gloob> and I whitelisted them int he SR/SH file
2017-01-25T13:32:32 <gloob> the last to be processed win? both are applied?
2017-01-25T13:33:05 <stegru> i don\'t know
2017-01-25T13:44:25 <kasparnet> gloob: the application term should take priority
2017-01-25T13:48:59 <kasparnet> ie. common term A that translates into application specific A1 will be used, unless the application specific setting A1 is specified in the preferences set

2017-01-25T15:18:23 <gtirloni> amatas: i got it today when running it on i-0037
2017-01-25T15:18:48 <gtirloni> i substituted the async wait for a pause (50sec) just so i could continue, but it looks like a bug in ansible
2017-01-25T15:24:13 * cindyli joined the channel
2017-01-25T15:28:54 <amatas> let me see
2017-01-25T15:30:11 <amatas> I didn\'t see this issue before
2017-01-25T15:31:21 <amatas> which task of the jenkins-master role throws that error?

2017-01-25T15:45:11 <gtirloni> colinclark amatas: sandra just sent an email saying she created a doc to collect topics for the f2f "next week" ... :) it\'s still on feb 20-23, right? or is this another f2f i\'m not aware of?
2017-01-25T15:45:23 <colinclark> hahaha
2017-01-25T15:45:57 <colinclark> I think she\'s probably just enthusiastic about the meetings
2017-01-25T15:46:01 <colinclark> and wishing they were sooner
2017-01-25T15:46:04 <gtirloni> hehe ok, i panic for a second
2017-01-25T15:46:14 <colinclark> So one thing I will encourage...
2017-01-25T15:46:27 <colinclark> and have talked to Sandra about this
2017-01-25T15:46:29 <colinclark> is much more time for paired working sessions
2017-01-25T15:47:06 <colinclark> less agenda items, more opportunity to actually work through specific issues in front of a laptop
2017-01-25T15:47:22 <gtirloni> nice +1
2017-01-25T15:49:10 <colinclark> so let\'s aim for maybe 3 hours of architectural discussion per day, max
2017-01-25T15:49:16 <colinclark> and actual work sessions the rest of the time
2017-01-25T15:49:19 <colinclark> we can be flexible
2017-01-25T15:52:01 <gtirloni> ok, sonds good

2017-01-25T16:59:08 <gtirloni> amatas: i\'ve deployed i-0037/38/39 from scratch using the jenkins-master/node roles and the deploy_app_jenkins.yml playbook... however, the last piece missing is the ca.crt file, should i generate a new one one my machine and push it to the ops repo?
2017-01-25T17:00:07 <gtirloni> amatas: https://github.com/inclusive-design/ops/blob/master/ansible/deploy_app_jenkins.yml#L26-L34
2017-01-25T17:05:45 <amatas> gtirloni, I think that you can use the crts that are in the LBs
2017-01-25T17:06:09 <amatas> search the cert that the domain ci.gpii.net is using and copy to the nodes. I should work
2017-01-25T17:06:31 <amatas> It will throw a warning though
2017-01-25T17:07:19 <gtirloni> ok thanks

2017-01-25T22:58:40 <avtar> hey mrtyler
2017-01-25T23:01:39 <avtar> i\'m looking at that report now
2017-01-25T23:01:49 <avtar> this is quite the stroll down memory lane
2017-01-25T23:05:37 <avtar> i believe what we did was refer to the throughput average from tsung reports, used that to derive estimates for the scenarios listed in the report, and came up with a dollar figure with the help of the aws cost calculator
2017-01-25T23:12:47 <avtar> i know you\'re thinking http://i.imgur.com/AfnKtkU.jpg and you would be right
