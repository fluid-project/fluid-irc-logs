2017-04-10T17:47:06 <gtirloni> cindyli: hi! what version of php do you use for achecker locally?
2017-04-10T17:47:30 <cindyli> gtirloni: 5.6.2
2017-04-10T17:48:12 <gtirloni> ok thanks. i might updated the server to that version then. the php process has been deadlocking and it seems to be an issue with php itself
2017-04-10T17:48:19 <gtirloni> s/updated/update/
2017-04-10T17:50:01 <cindyli> gtirloni: what's the issue? and what version of php has this issue?
2017-04-10T17:50:32 <gtirloni> 100% cpu utilization, it's happening on php 5.4.16
2017-04-10T17:50:45 <gtirloni> i have collected a bunch of debugging info, if you want to see it
2017-04-10T17:51:49 <gtirloni> the processes sit there doing nothing but using 100% cpu. they don't interact with disk, network, etc.. I got the stack trace and it all seems to point a function named php_error_cb in php

2017-04-10T19:40:23 <gtirloni> amatas: how long have those win* boxes been buildong on h-0005? :)
2017-04-10T19:43:13 <amatas> hey gtirloni, not much 2 or 3 hours each. The windows 7 for 32bits are the most problematic, I don't know why the keep stuck at the final step.
2017-04-10T19:43:38 <amatas> I'm trying to reproduce that issue at my local machine.
2017-04-10T19:44:05 * michelled joined the channel
2017-04-10T19:44:18 <amatas> Anyway I'm planning to release the other vms once they pass the tests
2017-04-10T19:46:41 <gtirloni> oh ok, i thought they had been there for days
