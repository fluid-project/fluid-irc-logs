b'2017-08-22T14:34:17 <gloob> a pluggable architecture of things
2017-08-22T14:34:33 <gloob> and a framework to easily define new listener or THINGS
2017-08-22T14:34:42 <gloob> do we have that?
2017-08-22T14:34:48 <stegru> yeh, I said to myself i need to start capturing the requirements
2017-08-22T14:35:02 <stegru> that\'s as far as i got :)
2017-08-22T14:35:10 <gloob> ok, I see
2017-08-22T14:35:53 <gloob> stegru: umhhh, https://github.com/stegru/gpii-windows-8/tree/master/GPIIWindows8 this is not decompiled
2017-08-22T14:35:57 <gloob> which is the difference
2017-08-22T14:36:00 <stegru> but yes, there needs to be something like a "ListenerHandler"
2017-08-22T14:36:20 <stegru> that code is the original, but not the same version
2017-08-22T14:36:25 <gloob> https://github.com/sgithens/gpii-windows-8/tree/master/GPIIWindows8
2017-08-22T14:36:28 <gloob> this one I mean
2017-08-22T14:37:37 <stegru> if you look in Program.cs, it contains LGS related stuff
2017-08-22T14:37:56 <gloob> aha ok
2017-08-22T14:44:05 <gloob> stegru: thank you very much, sir
2017-08-22T14:44:32 <stegru> de nada

2017-08-22T15:43:02 <javjarfer> hi kasparnet! Could you help me to trace something weird?
2017-08-22T15:44:18 <kasparnet> javjarfer: I can try :)
2017-08-22T15:45:23 <javjarfer> thanks! well, do you remember the issue I told you about trying to use a non-installed solution and resulting into a call to a non-related one?
2017-08-22T15:46:16 <kasparnet> yes

2017-08-22T15:56:39 <javjarfer> If I don\'t register the application, it activates the magnifier
2017-08-22T15:57:06 <javjarfer> if I register it, it actives it correctly (by register I mean, in the installedsolutions file)

2017-08-22T15:58:22 <kasparnet> I\'m not sure I follow, javjarfer
2017-08-22T15:58:47 <kasparnet> so if you add your new solution to installed solutions, it will be launched
2017-08-22T15:58:52 <kasparnet> else the magnifier is launched
2017-08-22T15:58:55 <kasparnet> is that correct?
2017-08-22T15:58:58 <javjarfer> yes, it\'s
2017-08-22T16:02:22 <javjarfer> now I think it... the other time was the narrator...
2017-08-22T16:02:41 * alanharnum has quit
2017-08-22T16:05:26 <kasparnet> it must be a preference in the preferences set that matches your new application
2017-08-22T16:05:32 <kasparnet> else it doesn\'t make any sense
2017-08-22T16:05:34 <kasparnet> :)
2017-08-22T16:06:49 <javjarfer> okay, I will advice when this commits are up, and pass you the line to remove, with a gist or something like that to test
2017-08-22T16:07:23 <javjarfer> so you can see it better... xD because it\'s clearly opaque without more data
2017-08-22T16:07:49 <gtirloni> agreed, it\'s kasper\'s fault <surprise surprise>

2017-08-22T16:55:14 <gtirloni> clown: because of line #94 here: https://pad.gpii.net/mypads/?/mypads/group/architecture-meetings-94p29xe/pad/view/arch-2017-08-09-v964ns3
2017-08-22T16:55:28 <gtirloni> GPII-2515 - CI has been changed to use the new `npm run test` commands - PR review is blocking (https://github.com/GPII/linux/pull/94)
2017-08-22T16:57:30 <clown> gtirloni:  okay thanks.  I vote for for reverting unless the pull 94 is going to be merged in the next little while...

2017-08-22T09:33:11 <kasparnet> hey javjarfer
2017-08-22T09:36:47 <javjarfer> hey! I'm tracing something about the SR and sure you will know better from where this comes
2017-08-22T09:37:03 <javjarfer> do you know, which module resolves env variables placed in SR?
2017-08-22T09:38:29 <javjarfer> like for example %systemroot% which can be found in the highcontrast setting use from the SPISETTINGHANDLER
2017-08-22T09:39:54 <javjarfer> it's interesting because if you can resolve those paths in the SR you can let the user specify 'relative' paths from the preferences, using environment variables
2017-08-22T09:41:02 <javjarfer> without that, it's very difficult than a user could specify any data, in a relative 'cross-system' way
2017-08-22T09:53:49 <kasparnet> sorry - didn't see your response
2017-08-22T09:53:51 <kasparnet> reading it now
2017-08-22T10:10:25 <javjarfer> kasparnet, np! I was tracing it yet xD
2017-08-22T10:11:31 <kasparnet> might be here https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/lifecycleManager/src/LifecycleManager.js#L353 javjarfer
2017-08-22T10:11:37 <kasparnet> hye bosmon, btw
2017-08-22T10:11:40 <kasparnet> I'm back
2017-08-22T10:12:10 <Bosmon> javjarfer - that is correct, yes
2017-08-22T10:19:28 <javjarfer> thanks you both, great, so if I understand well, resolvers are only applied to the actual SR but not user preferences, so this resolution, doesn't apply to what they can set
2017-08-22T10:20:31 <Bosmon> Well any preference values are interpolated by that point anyway
2017-08-22T10:20:59 <Bosmon> What value do you want to store in a user preference?
2017-08-22T10:21:25 <javjarfer> so, any expression like this ${{environment}.WINDIR}, would be resolved if used in a preference?
2017-08-22T10:22:01 <Bosmon> Wouldn't it, kasparnet?
2017-08-22T10:22:22 <javjarfer> I tried to resolve %homedrive%homepath% that is the 'typical way' to resolve the homepath in windows, but could be that I didn't use the right syntax
2017-08-22T10:22:50 <javjarfer> but I saw the %systemroot% actually resolved in the SR, so I couldn't guess, which one was the rule
2017-08-22T10:23:07 <Bosmon> javjarfer - no, the framework doesn't do Windows shell interpolation, that would be nonportable
2017-08-22T10:23:12 <Bosmon> WHere is %systemroot in the SR?
2017-08-22T10:23:42 <Bosmon> Oh, I see
2017-08-22T10:23:50 <Bosmon> Those are values written into the registry on behalf of a solution
2017-08-22T10:23:57 <Bosmon> The OS interprets those directly, not us
2017-08-22T10:26:04 <javjarfer> okay, I see, it's because it's an actual resolution of the setting handler
2017-08-22T10:28:53 <javjarfer> okay, so the actual value available for resolution are the values in process.env no?
2017-08-22T10:29:30 <Bosmon> There is also the WINDOWS REGISTRY RESOLVER
2017-08-22T10:29:32 <Bosmon> But you can write your own
2017-08-22T10:29:48 <Bosmon> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L575
2017-08-22T10:29:55 <Bosmon> Look at this one, for example
2017-08-22T10:39:51 <javjarfer> Bosmon, that is great, I have seeing it too, I will check how to implement one, but with having access to process.env will be enough for now I think! Thanks you!
2017-08-22T10:40:52 <kasparnet> Bosmon, javjarfer: sorry for missing the conversation (again)
2017-08-22T10:42:06 <javjarfer> kasparnet, np! I think Bosmon I have all doubts solved, I'm going to try to implement this, but I think I have all I need
2017-08-22T10:42:16 <kasparnet> cool

2017-08-22T11:01:47 <stegru> javjarfer: %SystemRoot% is resolved by windows when the value is read from the registry (if the type is something like REG_SZ_EXPAND)
2017-08-22T11:02:04 <stegru> or, it's resolved by cmd.exe - depending on where you're seeing it
2017-08-22T11:02:28 <stegru> eg: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/solutions/win32.json5#L2344
2017-08-22T11:08:30 <stegru> thanks kasparne_, i knew you could do it! (2535)
2017-08-22T11:08:50 <kasparne_> :D
2017-08-22T11:08:51 <javjarfer> stegru, thanks, it's actually resolved in the setting handler then no?
2017-08-22T11:09:40 <stegru> sort of.. it's resolved by RegGetValue
2017-08-22T11:13:52 <stegru> actually, it depends.. what line are you looking at, where it already works?
2017-08-22T11:15:47 <stegru> the %variable% things are stored like that, and the thing that uses the value (the system) does the expanding
2017-08-22T11:16:38 <stegru> that's true for all the occurences of %SystemRoot%, that i can see
2017-08-22T11:17:00 <stegru> in the win32.json, javjarfer
2017-08-22T11:19:25 <javjarfer> so are not resolved by the shell (CMD)? they are resolved by RegGetValue? But it doesn't take place in a actual 'resolver' as we were talking before no? The resolution comes once the string has been passed to the actual setting handler, in this case, the SpiSettingHandler
2017-08-22T11:21:01 <stegru> or cmd, depends on how/where this value is used
2017-08-22T11:21:38 <stegru> it doesn't take place in GPII
2017-08-22T11:22:17 <stegru> if it's a gpii.launch.exec, then cmd will resolve it
2017-08-22T11:27:45 <javjarfer> okay, then it's how I was thinking, thanks you!

2017-08-22T14:26:02 <stegru> i would have tidied up the de-compiled code, but i'd rather spend that time on writing the node.js version
