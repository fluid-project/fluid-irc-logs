2017-02-27T17:19:40 <gtirloni> mrtyler_: is it okay if we skip this week\'s infra meeting? alfredo is away, colin is stuck at meetings and.. we had the f2f last week :)
2017-02-27T17:20:55 <mrtyler_> gtirloni: fine with me, but i think sandra was expecting us to start on t-shirt sizing the gpii-2009 tickets
2017-02-27T17:21:08 <mrtyler_> so i guess you should check with her
2017-02-27T17:21:49 <gtirloni> got it. we\'d need alfredo anyway, maybe we can reschedule just you, alfredo and I later this week. i\'ll talk to sandra
2017-02-27T17:22:18 <mrtyler_> not sure if colin and avtar want to participate
2017-02-27T17:22:54 <gtirloni> right, yeah.. that\'d be better
2017-02-27T17:22:55 <mrtyler_> sandra just said that he\'s out mon-tue and leaves for europe thurs
2017-02-27T17:23:00 <mrtyler_> he = colin
2017-02-27T17:23:04 <mrtyler_> fyi
2017-02-27T17:23:06 <avtar1> mrtyler_:  i can\'t this week unfortunately
2017-02-27T17:23:30 <mrtyler_> avtar1: how much do you care about participating in the sizing exercise?
2017-02-27T17:25:01 <avtar1> i can be there if required but p4a demo tasks are a higher priority for me at the moment
2017-02-27T17:26:07 <mrtyler_> avtar1: i just mean in theory, how much do you care
2017-02-27T17:26:14 <mrtyler_> as it may affect when we try to schedule such a meeting
2017-02-27T17:26:21 <mrtyler_> i\'m not trying to compete with p4a priorities
2017-02-27T17:26:36 <mrtyler_> (maybe sandra wants to compete, but that\'s her deal ;))
2017-02-27T17:30:30 <mrtyler_> gtirloni: you\'re in toronto for the rest of the week, right?

2017-02-27T20:24:39 <javjarfer> hi stegru! Are you available for a couple of questions?
2017-02-27T20:25:05 <stegru> hi, yes I am
2017-02-27T20:28:17 <javjarfer> Hi! thanks you, I wanted to ask you about the Windows 10 to Windows 7 morphing, because Sandra and Bosmon, said me to contact with you, because you have experience with this.
2017-02-27T20:29:07 <stegru> they\'ve lied to you, because I don\'t know what is meant by that
2017-02-27T20:29:53 <stegru> can you explain what is meant by it?
2017-02-27T20:30:41 <javjarfer> stegru, hahaha, of course! Here you have the JIRA issue and a document of the actual research
2017-02-27T20:31:10 <javjarfer> Actual research: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EsOsgUPSdVoTdojGmZtu8dAS12rx1tJIov1vAkCMN2w/edit#
2017-02-27T20:31:23 <javjarfer> JIRA Issue: https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2300
2017-02-27T20:32:34 <stegru> ah yes ok
2017-02-27T20:32:46 <javjarfer> Do you have any idea of how to address the current problem detailed in the Google Docs document? At the "Current Problem" section
2017-02-27T20:36:21 <stegru> about the trademark?
2017-02-27T20:36:34 <javjarfer> yes
2017-02-27T20:36:48 <stegru> well, don\'t use the logo
2017-02-27T20:41:54 <javjarfer> well, yes, sure. But the point is to have the appearance of Windows 7, will be a little difficult without the logo

2017-02-27T20:46:17 <stegru_> sorry javjarfer, just changed computer
2017-02-27T20:46:43 <stegru_> well, i think this is more of a legal issue than a technical one
2017-02-27T20:47:09 <javjarfer> stegru_, yes, of course.
2017-02-27T20:48:41 <stegru_> where is the logo for? the desktop background?
2017-02-27T20:49:09 <javjarfer> stegru_, mainly for the menu tray icon
2017-02-27T20:51:18 <stegru_> ok, i\'ll see if i can find the logo embedded in an executable in windows 10
2017-02-27T20:52:16 <javjarfer> stegru_, that would be great. Thanks you! (I\'m going to switch computer for a second, sorry)
