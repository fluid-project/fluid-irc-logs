2017-01-24T15:59:58 <colinclark> gtirloni: I think you\'ll have to send it
2017-01-24T16:00:02 <colinclark> since it\'s your room
2017-01-24T16:00:06 <gtirloni> sure, one sec
2017-01-24T16:00:23 <colinclark> I suppose we could switch to Gotomeeting
2017-01-24T16:00:23 <gtirloni> https://conf.inclusivedesign.ca/flex.html?roomdirect.html&key=GChjxgbH2f
2017-01-24T16:00:28 <colinclark> it\'s just so, well, organized :P
2017-01-24T16:00:49 <colinclark> alternatively, it perhaps wouldn\'t hurt to have a dedicate ops room on Vidyo
2017-01-24T16:00:52 <colinclark> so we can drift in and out as necessary
2017-01-24T16:01:22 <gtirloni> i\'m fine with either one. i agree a dedicated ops room would be better (in both cases)

2017-01-24T18:57:47 <mrtyler> colinclark: looks like you\'re embroiled in conversation and it\'s lunch time for me anyway, but do you have time later to talk more about aws costing estimates?
2017-01-24T18:58:00 <mrtyler> gtirloni: you\'re welcome to join as well but since you just spend a couple hours with me i figured you could use a break :)
2017-01-24T18:58:24 <colinclark> mrtyler: amazingly i\'m embroiled in two conversations
2017-01-24T18:58:29 <colinclark> today is booked
2017-01-24T18:58:30 <colinclark> but tomorrow, yes
2017-01-24T18:58:31 <mrtyler> the goal is to provide sandra with more clarity about potential costs so she can deal with funding/budgeting/gregg/eugene
2017-01-24T18:58:34 <mrtyler> ok tmrw it is
2017-01-24T19:07:37 <colinclark> mrtyler: Yeah, that makes sense
2017-01-24T19:07:42 <colinclark> and I\'m happy to chat
2017-01-24T19:07:45 <colinclark> just checking my calendar
2017-01-24T19:07:50 <mrtyler> np
2017-01-24T19:08:05 <mrtyler> and not urgent. i think i can give sandra somewhat better intel even without talking to you
2017-01-24T19:08:10 <mrtyler> but it would be better after talking :)
2017-01-24T19:08:23 * stegru_ has quit
2017-01-24T19:08:27 <mrtyler> also tmrw is good as i\'m trying to sneak out and ski thursday if the weather cooperates
2017-01-24T19:08:32 <colinclark> Looks like I\'ve got 1-1:30 pm EDT tomorrow or 4 pm EDT
2017-01-24T19:08:36 <colinclark> or 9 am EDT, but that\'s early for you
2017-01-24T19:08:43 <colinclark> and for me :)
2017-01-24T19:08:45 <mrtyler> haha
2017-01-24T19:09:09 <mrtyler> those other times look ok modulo when all the meetings are tmrw
2017-01-24T19:09:20 <mrtyler> i feel like 1300-1330 is in one of those meetings
2017-01-24T19:09:29 <mrtyler> but 1600 est should be good
2017-01-24T19:09:33 <mrtyler> fyi you\'re not in daylight time anymore :p
2017-01-24T19:10:05 <mrtyler> (everyone gets this wrong. i just harp on it because i am a timezone dork)
2017-01-24T19:12:32 <mrtyler> alanharnum: i\'ll eschew the daily inquiry about FDS and instead share that we talked a bit about docker container CI etc. in the devops meeting this morning
2017-01-24T19:13:04 <mrtyler> i think gio expects the container CI to be up and running, which contradicts what you said in your email, so there\'s a disconnect there that is probably worth sorting out
2017-01-24T19:13:43 <mrtyler> there was nothing super actionable out of the discussion except, i guess, for my claim that this is a common problem, related to other common problems i see in the infrastructure, and that i am paying attention to it
2017-01-24T19:14:03 <mrtyler> but no tickets, no timeline, no committments or anything
2017-01-24T19:14:38 <mrtyler> maybe action items have fallen/will fall out of your work to get the FDS container back to life
2017-01-24T19:14:52 <colinclark> ack, mrtyler
2017-01-24T19:14:53 <colinclark> EST
2017-01-24T19:15:03 <colinclark> i wish it was EDT
2017-01-24T19:15:05 <mrtyler> i\'m happy to discuss and help
2017-01-24T19:15:20 <mrtyler> colinclark: but then 0900 eastern would be even earlier!
2017-01-24T19:15:21 <colinclark> i think alanharnum is actually off sick today, mrtyler
2017-01-24T19:15:27 <mrtyler> womp
2017-01-24T19:15:27 <colinclark> despite amazingly being here in spirit
2017-01-24T19:15:51 <mrtyler> maybe my words will give his immune system the boost it needs
2017-01-24T19:16:02 <colinclark> ok, let\'s do 1600 EST, mrtyler
2017-01-24T19:16:15 <mrtyler> it is plausible that too much docker containerization has suppressed his white blood cell count
2017-01-24T19:16:27 <mrtyler> colinclark: cool, thx
2017-01-24T19:16:48 <colinclark> what do you think we need to do next, mrtyler, to get to the point where we have tickets, timeline and committments?
2017-01-24T19:16:54 <colinclark> and gtirloni, too ^
2017-01-24T19:16:56 * avtar joined the channel
2017-01-24T19:17:09 <gtirloni> sorry, catching up, one sec
2017-01-24T19:17:11 * michelled joined the channel
2017-01-24T19:17:27 <mrtyler> colinclark: 1. decide that\'s the next most important thing to work on 2. sit down and brainstorm 3. brainstorming -> planning session
2017-01-24T19:18:23 <colinclark> ok
2017-01-24T19:18:33 <mrtyler> colinclark: calendar invite sent if you want it
2017-01-24T19:18:35 <colinclark> and relative to everything else on your plate, is #1 reasonable to assert?
2017-01-24T19:18:36 <colinclark> thanks
2017-01-24T19:18:59 <mrtyler> colinclark: it is not the next thing i personally want to tackle
2017-01-24T19:19:03 <colinclark> ha
2017-01-24T19:19:05 <colinclark> yes
2017-01-24T19:19:21 <mrtyler> i don\'t think i need to drive that project tactically
2017-01-24T19:19:42 <mrtyler> i would prefer to observe and advise and provide strategic guidance
2017-01-24T19:19:57 <mrtyler> but i do what y\'all pay me to do so that\'s all up for discussion :)
2017-01-24T19:20:02 <gtirloni> which project? sorry, i got lost between aws costs and gpii container ci/cd
2017-01-24T19:20:12 * cindyli joined the channel
2017-01-24T19:20:15 <mrtyler> gtirloni: all of this is about gpii container ci
2017-01-24T19:20:36 <mrtyler> gtirloni: altho if you want to join colin and i tomorrow at 1600 EST to talk about aws costs, you definitely can
2017-01-24T19:20:41 <colinclark> mrtyler: seems reasonable
2017-01-24T19:21:21 <gtirloni> ok got it
2017-01-24T19:21:59 <mrtyler> gtirloni: threw you on the invite just in case
2017-01-24T19:22:11 <mrtyler> gtirloni: also i\'m planning to watch that vault webinar tomorrow

2017-01-24T19:30:33 <gtirloni> cool, thanks!
2017-01-24T19:30:57 * simonjb joined the channel
2017-01-24T19:32:40 <gtirloni> the buzz with vault and kubernetes is because k8s stores secrets inside etcd (distributed consensus-based key-value store).. the argument is: if someone gets hold of the etcd database, you\'re already screwed because that\'s the source of truth for k8s (and an attacker could very well get root on all your machine by exploiting that).. so the secrets are "relatively" safe there as it\'s in your best interest to keep the etcd nodes safe and
2017-01-24T19:32:41 <gtirloni> secure. but vault adds at-rest encryption and other nice stuff that covers other corner cases.. however, last i checked, the integration with k8s was 100%
