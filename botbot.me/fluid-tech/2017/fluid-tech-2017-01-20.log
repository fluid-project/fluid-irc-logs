2017-01-20T15:46:14 <mrtyler> amatas: i doubt i know enough to be helpful but are you still looking at gio\'s h3-pocalypse?
2017-01-20T15:46:30 <mrtyler> no alanharnum yet or is he out today?
2017-01-20T15:51:49 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-01-20T16:21:20 <amatas> hi mrtyler!, I\'m not able to make any progress on that
2017-01-20T16:21:44 <amatas> mainly because the VMs definitions don\'t match with the VM disks images that are in the system
2017-01-20T16:22:03 <mrtyler> right i was confused by the grep you posted vs the contents of the libvirt dir
2017-01-20T16:22:26 <mrtyler> i have no context so i\'m not going to dive in and start moving stuff around
2017-01-20T16:22:27 <amatas> I\'m not aware of the state of h-0003 so I\'d like to avoid screwing up more things
2017-01-20T16:22:31 <mrtyler> guess we\'ll wait for gio and monday
2017-01-20T16:22:37 <mrtyler> right
2017-01-20T16:22:54 <amatas> anyway if you need help, ping me
2017-01-20T16:23:03 <mrtyler> just wanted to make sure there wasn\'t anything i could be helping with
2017-01-20T16:23:14 <mrtyler> amatas: do you know anything about our grafana setup?
2017-01-20T16:23:19 <mrtyler> or grafana/influxdb/collectd in general?
2017-01-20T16:23:22 <amatas> no, sorry
2017-01-20T16:23:24 <mrtyler> ok :)
2017-01-20T16:23:35 <mrtyler> do you know where alan is?
2017-01-20T16:24:14 <amatas> well, he is connected, alanharnum, are you around?
2017-01-20T16:24:21 <alanharnum> yus
2017-01-20T16:24:28 <mrtyler> oh you\'re here now, neat
2017-01-20T16:24:50 <mrtyler> alanharnum: just wanted to check in on our migration thing. you weren\'t in irc when i looked before
2017-01-20T16:25:03 <amatas> glad to see how people meet on friday :D
2017-01-20T16:25:06 <mrtyler> haha
2017-01-20T16:25:23 <alanharnum> mrtyler: i\'m writing up a summary now - remember what I said about "this will be 45 minutes, or it will be 10 hours"?
2017-01-20T16:25:27 <alanharnum> it was, not surprisingly, the latter
2017-01-20T16:25:31 <mrtyler> :(
2017-01-20T16:26:19 <alanharnum> it will amaze us all to hear that when you have three rapidly-evolving technologies (Docker, Ansible and GPII) in the mix, drift happens if you don\'t really look at things for a year!
2017-01-20T16:27:04 <alanharnum> however, i am proceeding in the spirit of blameless post-mortems to try and sum up the issues i\'ve uncovered
2017-01-20T16:28:09 <amatas> that would be a great topic for the next ops meeting
2017-01-20T16:31:04 <alanharnum> none of it is insurmountable or all that complex
2017-01-20T16:33:59 <mrtyler> amatas: just to catch you up on some casual chats i had yesterday, i think it is a Significant Problem that we don\'t run ansible on our infrastructure all the time
2017-01-20T16:34:12 <mrtyler> to minimize drift and otherewise catch problems quickly
2017-01-20T16:34:28 <mrtyler> i\'m not sure what the action item is yet, but i\'ve been reading more about ansible
2017-01-20T16:34:33 <Tabs16> hello everyone
2017-01-20T16:34:42 <mrtyler> i\'ve seen at least one suggestion that "ansible -C" all the time is a good method to at least notice drift
2017-01-20T16:35:00 <mrtyler> we\'d have to pair it with some kind of notification system (hopefully not email or ephemeral irc robotics)
2017-01-20T16:35:15 <mrtyler> i suspect there is tooling for this problem but haven\'t looked yet
2017-01-20T16:35:23 <mrtyler> some kind of ansible dashboard or something
2017-01-20T16:35:35 <amatas> ansible tower I guess
2017-01-20T16:35:54 <mrtyler> oh right :\\
2017-01-20T16:35:58 <mrtyler> how much does that thing cost?
2017-01-20T16:36:06 <amatas> I don\'t know
2017-01-20T16:36:22 <mrtyler> probably more than a raspi ;)
2017-01-20T16:36:28 <amatas> haha
2017-01-20T16:36:37 <mrtyler> hi Tabs16
2017-01-20T16:37:19 <Tabs16> hey mrtyler
2017-01-20T16:38:01 <Tabs16> I am acquainted with js and node.js .Can you suggest me some projects to work on? Moreover,I am a gsoc aspirant.
2017-01-20T16:42:07 <mrtyler> hi Tabs16. i can\'t really help you with that except to say:
2017-01-20T16:42:21 <mrtyler> 1. #fluid-work is probably a better channel for this kind of question. there are more people who work on Fluid there
2017-01-20T16:42:26 <mrtyler> 2. i think this is the relevant link: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Google+Summer+of+Code+2016+with+the+Fluid+Project
2017-01-20T16:42:33 <mrtyler> good luck and have fun :)
2017-01-20T16:44:59 <amatas> mrtyler, I think that we are able to recreate all the infrastructure using our ansible roles. But also I guess that we need a plan to avoid situations like h3 host
2017-01-20T16:45:31 <mrtyler> amatas: we\'ll never know if we can recreate it unless we\'re trying to recreate it all the time :)
2017-01-20T16:45:53 <amatas> anyway Gio have a lot to say here
2017-01-20T16:45:53 <mrtyler> i don\'t think the h3 problems this mornign are related to ansible drift, but it\'s hard to say without knowing more about exactly what gio did and what went wrong
2017-01-20T16:46:38 <mrtyler> i\'m sure he does :)
2017-01-20T16:47:14 <Tabs16> thanks mrtyler
2017-01-20T16:47:20 <mrtyler> wow the $13 toaster i bought from target this week suuuuuuuux
2017-01-20T16:47:35 <mrtyler> Tabs16: np :)
