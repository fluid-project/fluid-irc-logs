2017-03-27T14:27:48 <gtirloni> alanharnum amatas: ansible has a debugger, who\'d have known: http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks_debugger.html
2017-03-27T14:27:52 <gtirloni> and it works pretty well
2017-03-27T14:28:15 <alanharnum> gtirloni: the Ansible developers, presumably
2017-03-27T14:28:15 <amatas> O_O
2017-03-27T14:28:36 <gtirloni> alanharnum: fair point
2017-03-27T14:28:55 <amatas> I knew the "debug" command but I wasn\'t aware of this
2017-03-27T14:29:07 <alanharnum> gtirloni: documentation vs. implementation, the eternal open source gap :p
2017-03-27T14:29:24 <alanharnum> it\'s a pretty recent feature, def good to know about
2017-03-27T14:29:43 <alanharnum> debugging why things are going wrong w/Ansible has always pretty bad, this looks like a good addition
2017-03-27T14:29:49 <alanharnum> thanks gtirloni!
2017-03-27T14:30:15 <gtirloni> yeah, ansible 2.1 was released in May 2016 with this new debugger. I see the docs showed up in December
2017-03-27T14:30:25 <alanharnum> haha
2017-03-27T14:30:33 <alanharnum> yeah that sounds about right :(
2017-03-27T14:30:57 <gtirloni> well, no more insane printf debugging with the debug module now :)
