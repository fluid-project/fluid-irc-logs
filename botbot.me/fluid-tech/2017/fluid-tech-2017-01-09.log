b'2017-01-09T19:48:13 <colinclark> hey amatas
2017-01-09T19:48:16 <colinclark> just thought of another question for you
2017-01-09T19:48:45 <colinclark> For one of my open source projects, I have the need to automatically run Node.js and Testem browser-based tests in two different types of VMs
2017-01-09T19:48:49 <colinclark> one Linux, one Windows
2017-01-09T19:49:05 <colinclark> is your new stuff in shape that I could try it out with this project?

2017-01-09T15:02:31 <gtirloni> colinclark: we usually use my room, it\'s unlocked

2017-01-09T15:03:19 <colinclark> can you pass a room invite on to mrtyler, gtirloni?

2017-01-09T15:57:39 <gtirloni> amatas, do you remember what was the website that had all our names and timezones?
2017-01-09T15:57:44 <gtirloni> gloob, ^
2017-01-09T15:58:26 <mrtyler> oh i know what that is
2017-01-09T15:59:11 <mrtyler> i just couldn\'t remember off the top of my head
2017-01-09T15:59:14 <mrtyler> also now i can\'t find it :p
2017-01-09T15:59:24 <mrtyler> oh wait here:
2017-01-09T15:59:29 <mrtyler> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EDYhWYipUluzG6K8S-W4clsAGInm2RdjkpKq9Lw_dhE/edit
2017-01-09T15:59:37 <amatas> mmm, I use a gnome plugin for that :D
2017-01-09T15:59:45 <amatas> let me check my bookmarks
2017-01-09T15:59:47 <mrtyler> oh i lied that doesn\'t have timezones T.T
2017-01-09T16:00:02 <mrtyler> i lied again. it does, but no gmt offsets. savagery
2017-01-09T16:00:07 <gtirloni> https://timezone.io/team/gpii
2017-01-09T16:00:29 <amatas> that is!
2017-01-09T16:00:39 <mrtyler> gtirloni++
2017-01-09T16:00:44 <mrtyler> that is handy. how do i add myself?
2017-01-09T16:00:55 <gtirloni> good question,i think gloob has to invite you
2017-01-09T16:01:04 * mrtyler Creates An Account... maybe
2017-01-09T16:02:13 <gtirloni> amatas, i switched to gnome3 recently, which plugin do you use?
2017-01-09T16:02:25 <mrtyler> i made an account but maybe gloob needs to add me to the gpii group
2017-01-09T16:02:54 <amatas> gtirloni, the app "clocks" add each timezone in the notification bar
2017-01-09T16:03:53 <gtirloni> amatas, cool, thanks
2017-01-09T16:04:52 <amatas> yw
2017-01-09T16:05:31 <mrtyler> heh, my mac affiliate doesn\'t open for another hour
2017-01-09T16:07:07 <mrtyler> the good news is i fixed growl (it was tmux\'s fault) but then realized i don\'t need growl anymore and upgraded to terminal-notifier
2017-01-09T16:15:14 <gloob> timezone.io
2017-01-09T16:15:21 <gloob> /gpii
2017-01-09T16:15:52 <gloob> https://timezone.io/team/gpii
2017-01-09T16:16:11 <gloob> growl for what?
2017-01-09T16:16:18 <gloob> connecting irssi maybe?
2017-01-09T16:16:28 <gloob> I have a fancy setup
2017-01-09T16:16:40 <gloob> mosh + tmux + irssi in one end
2017-01-09T16:16:57 <gloob> iterm2 + osx in the other
2017-01-09T16:17:09 <gloob> I think that you dont need growl anymore in osx
2017-01-09T16:17:10 <mrtyler> gloob: yeah exactly that. irssi runs in tmux and uses growl-notify to ding me
2017-01-09T16:17:21 <gloob> because they implement that stupid notification thing
2017-01-09T16:17:29 <gloob> aha
2017-01-09T16:17:34 <mrtyler> gloob: correct, it was from an older configuration when i couldn\'t move up to mission control or whatever apple calls the new notification framework
2017-01-09T16:17:42 <gloob> well, I am happier in a async configuration :D
2017-01-09T16:18:03 <mrtyler> just cuz it notifies you doesn\'t mean you ahve to pay attention :)
2017-01-09T16:18:15 <gloob> notification is the root of all evilness
2017-01-09T16:18:24 <gloob> ions*
2017-01-09T16:18:27 <gloob> are
2017-01-09T16:18:32 <gloob> and all that grammar things xD
2017-01-09T16:18:42 <mrtyler> yelp used irc a ton, including for coordinating oncall incident response, so sometimes you need the synch
2017-01-09T16:18:48 <gloob> so you have 1.0.0
2017-01-09T16:18:50 <gloob> ?
2017-01-09T16:18:54 <gloob> I DIDNT YET
2017-01-09T16:19:01 <gloob> I\'m waiting for the moment
2017-01-09T16:19:36 <gloob> https://timezone.io/join/7b3e10dca096216a
2017-01-09T16:19:47 <gloob> mrtyler: join USSSSSSSSSSS
2017-01-09T16:19:51 <mrtyler> gloob++ looks like i\'m in
2017-01-09T16:20:02 <mrtyler> adding a new column and making everyone do more math
2017-01-09T16:20:10 <gloob> OH A NEW ONE
2017-01-09T16:20:22 <gloob> to the west :(
2017-01-09T16:20:32 <gloob> afu
2017-01-09T16:20:48 <mrtyler> it\'s ok, i\'m just timeshifting eastward
2017-01-09T16:21:05 <mrtyler> e.g. standup before sunup ;)
2017-01-09T16:21:08 <gloob> great for us, the poor guys in the north of africa
2017-01-09T16:21:09 <mrtyler> (winter months only)
2017-01-09T16:21:45 <gloob> colinclark: you missed the meeting MAN
2017-01-09T16:22:01 <mrtyler> just noticed i\'m further north than toronto
2017-01-09T16:22:05 <colinclark> you mean the meeting I\'m sitting in now, gloob?
2017-01-09T16:22:08 <colinclark> :P
2017-01-09T16:22:15 <gloob> nono, you know which one
2017-01-09T16:22:21 <gloob> AH
2017-01-09T16:22:23 <gloob> you are here
2017-01-09T16:22:24 <colinclark> hahaha
2017-01-09T16:22:41 <gloob> well, your absence was noticed
2017-01-09T16:22:44 <colinclark> lovely!
2017-01-09T16:22:47 <gloob> ALMOST
2017-01-09T16:22:49 <colinclark> it\'s always nice to be missed
2017-01-09T16:23:08 * michelled1 joined the channel
2017-01-09T16:23:12 <colinclark> but I figured it was more important to hang out with gtirloni and mrtyler and amatas
2017-01-09T16:23:27 <gloob> colinclark: you are my light in the darkness
2017-01-09T16:23:30 <mrtyler> in your face, gloob
2017-01-09T16:23:34 <colinclark> shucks
2017-01-09T16:23:55 <gloob> mrtyler: absolutely
2017-01-09T16:27:16 <amatas> colinclark, indeed, I needed to ensure that everbody survived to xmas
2017-01-09T16:27:23 <colinclark> :)

2017-01-09T19:16:29 <gtirloni> amatas, regarding https://github.com/idi-ops/ansible-nginx-reverse/pull/11, i understand the chances are mostly to the endpoints.conf.j2 file, right? are the files in the tests/ dir something I should be trying to run here?
2017-01-09T19:18:20 <mrtyler> TIL trello came from fog creek

2017-01-09T19:33:07 * clown joined the channel
2017-01-09T19:38:35 <amatas> gtirloni, yes, the changes are in endpoints.conf.j2 The files in tests/ are only used at testing
2017-01-09T19:40:05 <gtirloni> i\'m trying to think of a testing strategy for this PR :)
2017-01-09T19:40:40 <gtirloni> i think i\'ll create some LB VM\'s from scratch and apply this role using our global definitions.. sounds good?
2017-01-09T19:41:29 <amatas> gtirloni, this playbook https://github.com/amatas/ansible-nginx-reverse/blob/letsencrypt/tests/test-playbook.yml#L122-L123
2017-01-09T19:41:56 <amatas> creates multiple configuration files and then compare with the tests files of the repository
2017-01-09T19:42:45 <amatas> you only have to run the playbook in a docker container or VM to check that the role is creating the nginx config files right
2017-01-09T19:42:53 <gtirloni> cool, thanks
