2017-03-22T09:38:22 <the-t-in-rtf1> Looks like you can mix documents ala CouchDB, but also graphs of relationships.
2017-03-22T09:38:40 <the-t-in-rtf1> And they have a structured query language.
2017-03-22T09:38:57 <the-t-in-rtf1> Mango fits our way of working pretty well, but the hybrid graph/document db aspect is interesting.
2017-03-22T09:39:32 <the-t-in-rtf1> is also supports just storing key/values, but we don\'t have to tell anyone that.

2017-03-22T16:20:16 <gtirloni> amatas mrtyler: is it okay to add a new sub-ticket to GPII-2010 to: research how to collect logs from local file on windows? or is it better to track this some other way?
2017-03-22T16:20:41 <mrtyler> seems reasonable
2017-03-22T16:21:58 <amatas> sounds good for me as well
2017-03-22T16:23:13 <gtirloni> thanks
2017-03-22T16:29:52 <gtirloni> GPII-2346
2017-03-22T16:30:07 <gtirloni> btw, is it next Monday when we do the "sprint planning"?

2017-03-22T16:41:13 <gtirloni> amatas: are you upgrading your local instance? https://about.gitlab.com/2017/03/22/gitlab-9-0-released/
2017-03-22T16:41:34 <amatas> gtirloni, I\'ve upgraded to the latest of 8.X
2017-03-22T16:41:51 <amatas> as I use a docker container https://github.com/sameersbn/docker-gitlab
2017-03-22T16:42:04 <gtirloni> nice!
2017-03-22T16:42:41 <amatas> but I\'m looking forward to use the new version. I\'ll wait to at least .1 release though
2017-03-22T16:45:23 <gtirloni> that\'s a safe approach, we\'re not running out of headaches in many other areas so saving an additional one seems good :)
