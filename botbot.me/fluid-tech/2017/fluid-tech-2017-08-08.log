2017-08-08T15:16:21 <colinclark> mrtyler: I shared a Google doc with you regarding our approach to deploying and upgrading the GPII cloud infrastructure
2017-08-08T15:16:29 <colinclark> Can you have a look and add anything you think is interesting before I send it off?
2017-08-08T15:16:54 <mrtyler> colinclark: yes. it looked good after a skim, going to review it again shortly
2017-08-08T15:17:34 <colinclark> thanks very much, mrtyler!
2017-08-08T15:33:39 <mrtyler> colinclark: lgtm
2017-08-08T15:33:45 <colinclark> thanks so much
2017-08-08T15:33:48 <mrtyler> i have some smaller technical nits
2017-08-08T15:33:52 <colinclark> your edits were great
2017-08-08T15:34:03 <mrtyler> but if i understand the purpose of this document correctly, i don\'t think they matter much right now
2017-08-08T15:34:09 <colinclark> yes
2017-08-08T15:34:12 <mrtyler> if my understanding is incorrect, lmk
2017-08-08T15:34:14 <mrtyler> ok :)
2017-08-08T15:34:17 <colinclark> but I\'m happy to talk about them
2017-08-08T15:34:42 <mrtyler> i noted a couple of them already :)
2017-08-08T15:34:45 <colinclark> but this is a high-level reminder for a few questions that seems to keep cropping up whenever gtirloni sends his maintenance notices :)
2017-08-08T15:34:52 <mrtyler> another would be: you mention SLAs twice but i\'m not aware of any documented SLAs
2017-08-08T15:34:58 <colinclark> ah, very good point
2017-08-08T15:35:03 <colinclark> we should not that we need to develop them
2017-08-08T15:35:05 <colinclark> I\'ll write something
2017-08-08T15:35:11 <mrtyler> sounds good
2017-08-08T15:35:48 <mrtyler> fwiw i talked about this with gloob, who dug up some SLA numbers from some old document
2017-08-08T15:36:05 <colinclark> aha
2017-08-08T15:36:07 <colinclark> interesting
2017-08-08T15:36:13 <mrtyler> anyway, probably not needed for this update for gregg
2017-08-08T15:37:01 <mrtyler> i\'ve been thinking about blue/green deployments and kubernetes upgrades. i\'m glad you mentioned them and mentioned that those features are further along the development timeline :)
2017-08-08T15:37:13 <colinclark> cool
2017-08-08T15:37:17 <mrtyler> anyway, thx for writing this up
2017-08-08T15:38:13 <colinclark> no problem!
2017-08-08T15:38:20 <colinclark> thanks for your excellent feedback
2017-08-08T15:42:50 <mrtyler> colinclark: no idea what this means or if it matters but fyi the email you just sent to gregg, gmail says this about it:
2017-08-08T15:42:53 <mrtyler> Clark, Colin <cclark@ocadu.ca>
2017-08-08T15:42:55 <mrtyler> The certificate is not trusted. Sender info
2017-08-08T15:43:44 <colinclark> sweet
2017-08-08T15:43:54 <mrtyler> i guess you have some self-signed cert associated with this account
2017-08-08T15:44:20 <colinclark> I love Exchange :P
2017-08-08T15:44:28 <mrtyler> haha
2017-08-08T15:44:39 <colinclark> Are you using Mac Mail, mrtyler?
2017-08-08T15:44:48 <mrtyler> no, gmail in browser
2017-08-08T15:46:23 <colinclark> ok, interesting
2017-08-08T15:46:34 <colinclark> looks like there is a "Turn off digital signing" button in mail
2017-08-08T15:46:59 <colinclark> since I don\'t have any kind of certificate that I\'m aware of, who knows what it was doing
2017-08-08T15:47:01 <colinclark> but it\'s now off
2017-08-08T15:47:03 <colinclark> thanks for letting me know
2017-08-08T15:47:08 <mrtyler> heh np
2017-08-08T15:47:46 <mrtyler> i feel like if you wanted secure email you\'d use gpg like a civilized human :)
2017-08-08T15:49:38 <colinclark> yeah, exactly
