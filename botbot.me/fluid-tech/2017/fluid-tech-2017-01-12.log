2017-01-12T16:17:40 <simonjb> alanharnum: this morning I added some notes to the workshop wiki page on CHIP GPIO and on lighting an LED
2017-01-12T16:17:52 <alanharnum> thanks simonjb!
2017-01-12T16:17:58 <alanharnum> really excited for this workshop

2017-01-12T16:46:11 <gloob> simonjb: what are you doing with the chips?
2017-01-12T16:46:21 <gloob> I have one, here, in front of me, blinking
2017-01-12T16:48:25 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-01-12T16:48:47 <stegru> me too, gloob, but i have no use for it.
2017-01-12T16:49:48 <amatas> stegru, gloob : octoprint ATM
2017-01-12T16:50:40 <simonjb> gloob: I\'ve been using them for the Nexus, so far in 2 capacities: (1) to host a standalone Nexus with its own ad-hoc wifi network and (2) to wirelessly connect a braille display to the Nexus
2017-01-12T16:51:22 <amatas> also I built a small wifi router using the "two" interfaces that it has, but I didn\'t achieve a good transfer rate since the two interfaces shares the same hardware device.
2017-01-12T16:52:08 <simonjb> amatas: what rate were you getting?
2017-01-12T16:52:26 <amatas> 1 or 2 mb/seg
2017-01-12T16:53:40 <simonjb> thanks amatas, good to know -- I\'ve not tried that yet but was definitely thinking of it 1 or 2 mb/s isn\'t super fast of course but for many use cases it is certainly adequate
2017-01-12T16:54:31 <gloob> simonjb: so much power for the braille display, no? an esp-8266 seems better option maybe?
2017-01-12T16:55:02 <gloob> amatas: which two interfaces?
2017-01-12T16:55:17 <simonjb> gloob: wlan0 and wlan1
2017-01-12T16:56:43 <simonjb> gloob: yes an esp-8266 would definitely be an option but with the CHIP, I can use the Linux drivers for the display
2017-01-12T16:56:57 <gloob> but they are hw separated?
2017-01-12T16:57:16 <gloob> the c.h.i.p. specifications page is not the best on the world
2017-01-12T16:57:31 <amatas> gloob, no, it\'s the same realtek device that reports two interfaces
2017-01-12T16:58:09 <gloob> so you cannot use different channel? or let the hw do channel hopping or what?
2017-01-12T16:58:11 <amatas> for example you only can set one wireless channel to work
2017-01-12T16:58:34 <gloob> simonjb: sounds really interesting!
2017-01-12T16:58:35 <amatas> if you set the channel in one interface, you can\'t change in the second one
2017-01-12T16:58:51 <stegru> what\'s the point in that?
2017-01-12T17:18:09 * clown joined the channel
2017-01-12T17:28:23 <gloob> stegru: to have two interfaces :D
2017-01-12T17:29:59 <stegru> gloob: but you can only use one at a time?
2017-01-12T17:31:26 <amatas> stegru, it is possible to use both at the same time with some limitations
2017-01-12T17:31:39 <gloob> stegru: same channel, you can do that with the linux kernel, right?

2017-01-12T21:01:37 <gtirloni> looks like we\'re safe from this issue by using centos and selinux
