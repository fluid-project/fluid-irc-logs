2017-01-16T15:02:08 <colinclark> hi gtirloni_, be there in a sec
2017-01-16T15:02:14 <colinclark> just finished my last meeting
2017-01-16T15:04:15 * michelled1 joined the channel

2017-01-16T15:15:13 <gtirloni_> added a link to the pad directory here: https://wiki.gpii.net/w/Weekly_Infrastructure_Meeting_Notes (the same as is done for Architecture meetings)

2017-01-16T15:41:57 <gtirloni_> amatas: when avtar and I were looking at how to run many OSes and bitness versions, we found this: https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-build  (it\'s supposed to read travis\' yml and create a shell script that will do the coordination). just sharing in case it gives you some insights for the vagrant plugin
2017-01-16T15:57:56 * Caren joined the channel
2017-01-16T16:07:50 <amatas> oh, thanks gtirloni_
2017-01-16T16:19:51 * mrtyler joined the channel
2017-01-16T16:46:05 <gtirloni_> mrtyler: hi! not sure if you have found this yet but one of the major ways of spinning up a kubernetes cluster on AWS has been \'kops\', which can spit out a Terraform configuration (https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/blob/master/docs/terraform.md) instead of going ahead and deploying the AWS-level components itself. there is some competition among the various k8s lifecycle tools with \'kubeadm\' being the latest sanctioned container (and it
2017-01-16T16:46:06 <gtirloni_> might be more cloud-agnostic in that regard but I think it doesn\'t support HA setups yet, which should be fine for us)
2017-01-16T16:46:33 <mrtyler> gtirloni_: yup i\'ve seen kops
2017-01-16T16:46:39 <mrtyler> and kubeadm
2017-01-16T16:46:45 <gtirloni_> cpp;
2017-01-16T16:46:47 <gtirloni_> cool
2017-01-16T16:46:51 <mrtyler> and yeah, there are a few ways to do terraform->k8s
2017-01-16T16:47:01 <mrtyler> yet another reason to start using terraform :)
2017-01-16T16:51:51 <mrtyler> colinclark: some bumper music before the next meeting: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v79GeSoBnqY
2017-01-16T16:52:05 <colinclark> oh man
2017-01-16T16:52:08 <colinclark> I\'m a huge Fela fan
2017-01-16T16:52:15 <colinclark> but Ebo is new to me
2017-01-16T16:52:16 <colinclark> thanks!
2017-01-16T16:52:24 <mrtyler> o7
2017-01-16T16:52:35 <mrtyler> i should listen to more fela
2017-01-16T16:52:43 <mrtyler> and also this guy

2017-01-16T18:54:34 <colinclark> hey michelled, you know a bit about Electron, right?
2017-01-16T18:56:08 <michelled> colinclark: a bit :)
2017-01-16T18:56:10 <michelled> what\'s up?
2017-01-16T18:56:28 <colinclark> When you have a spare moment, can you do a quick code review of this? https://github.com/colinbdclark/infusion-electron/pull/9
2017-01-16T18:56:45 <colinclark> The caveat, of course, is that this library currently contains no tests, nor demos/examples :P
2017-01-16T18:56:49 <colinclark> (don\'t tell the-t-in-rtf)
2017-01-16T18:57:09 <colinclark> This is one of these "aspirational repositories"
2017-01-16T18:57:18 <colinclark> one which I\'m hoping to contribute to the Fluid Project some day
2017-01-16T18:57:25 <michelled> sounds good
2017-01-16T18:57:26 <colinclark> but of course I will be painfully rejected without some tests
2017-01-16T18:57:36 <colinclark> but at least I\'m trying to do as much in the way of quality practices as possible
2017-01-16T18:57:53 <colinclark> so I figure you\'d be good to do a code review if you have time
2017-01-16T18:57:57 <colinclark> obviously not a priority

2017-01-16T19:16:49 <colinclark> simonjb, Bosmon: So one idea I had for a GSoC project was to build a viable, cross-platform audio backend for Node.js
2017-01-16T19:17:28 <colinclark> which will inevitably be useful for some of the Nexus/IoT-related projects we\'re thinking of, for example having a Nexified sonification engine running on a CHIP or Pi or whatever
2017-01-16T19:17:42 <colinclark> the problem, of course, is that I\'m a terrible, dangerous C++ coder
2017-01-16T19:17:57 <colinclark> would you two be willing to support me in the code review for such a GSoC project?
2017-01-16T19:18:14 <colinclark> assuming I was the primary point of contact so that you\'d have few distractions?
2017-01-16T19:20:05 <Bosmon> colinclark - sure... I\'m willing to look over stuff : P
2017-01-16T19:20:19 <Bosmon> I can\'t claim to be anything other than a terrible, dangerous C++ coder myself
2017-01-16T19:45:48 * stegru has quit
2017-01-16T19:57:53 <colinclark> hahaha
2017-01-16T19:58:01 <simonjb> colinclark: yes, I\'m happy to help out
2017-01-16T20:00:39 <simonjb> colinclark: I\'m just testing the conductivity sensor with some salt water and it looks like it\'s working just fine
2017-01-16T20:01:27 <simonjb> I also tested the USB boards again and I think one of them is faulty
2017-01-16T20:02:06 <simonjb> I will contact the seller and figure out an exchange
2017-01-16T20:56:38 <colinclark> glad to hear the conductivity sensor works
2017-01-16T20:56:45 <colinclark> and that sucks about the BNC-USB board
2017-01-16T20:56:53 <colinclark> hopefuly the vendor is good about processing an exchange
