2017-07-21T18:57:20 <simonjb> hi there cindyli, can I ask you a fluid ioc testing question?
2017-07-21T18:57:32 <cindyli> sure, simonjb
2017-07-21T18:58:34 <simonjb> awesome
2017-07-21T18:59:13 <simonjb> do you know if it\'s possible to reset the state of a fluid.test.testCaseHolder during a test sequence?
2017-07-21T18:59:46 <simonjb> I have multiple tests within a fluid.test.testCaseHolder and the state is persisting between them
2017-07-21T19:00:14 <simonjb> I could use multiple fluid.test.testCaseHolders but wondering if I can use a single one
2017-07-21T19:01:08 <cindyli> checking...
2017-07-21T19:01:26 <simonjb> https://github.com/simonbates/co-occurrence-engine/blob/master/tests/CoOccurrenceEngineTests.js
2017-07-21T19:02:05 <simonjb> the state of "{componentRoot}" persists between tests
2017-07-21T19:02:59 <simonjb> that file above has a single test
2017-07-21T19:03:29 <simonjb> I\'m adding a second test sequence but want componentRoot to be reset for the second test sequence
2017-07-21T19:03:39 * javjarfer joined the channel
2017-07-21T19:07:21 <cindyli> simonjb: all tests defined within one test case holder points to the same instantiated tested components. it\'s kind of making sense to have state being persisted. if you wanna reuse one test holder, I think what you could try is to manually reset tested components in between test sequence, such as destroy and wait for the recreation of test components before starting the next test sequence
2017-07-21T19:08:08 * alanharnum has quit
2017-07-21T19:08:12 <cindyli> but i wonder it might need some special handling to ensure the next test sequence only starts when the recreation is done
2017-07-21T19:08:14 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-07-21T19:08:30 <simonjb> thanks cindyli, I started doing the resetting myself but it\'s a bit of a hassle
2017-07-21T19:08:43 <cindyli> i can imagine ;)
2017-07-21T19:08:47 <simonjb> I think I\'ll use a separate testCaseHolder
2017-07-21T19:08:51 <simonjb> thanks very much!
2017-07-21T19:09:04 * javjarfer has quit
2017-07-21T19:09:13 <cindyli> ok. cool. anytime
2017-07-21T19:13:35 <michelled> simonjb: have you implemented using multiple testcaseholders?
2017-07-21T19:13:52 <simonjb> not yet michelled
2017-07-21T19:14:52 <michelled> do you happen to know of anywhere that is doing that successfully? my attempts are so far resulting in errors
2017-07-21T19:15:09 <simonjb> ah :(
2017-07-21T19:17:24 <simonjb> michelled, cindyli, I think want I actually need in my case is separate testEnvironments
2017-07-21T19:19:15 <cindyli> simonjb: if tests components were created as siblings of test case holder within testEnvironments, that might be the case
2017-07-21T19:20:12 <simonjb> cindyli: can you expand on "that might be the case"
2017-07-21T19:20:33 <cindyli> meaning using separate testEnvironments
2017-07-21T19:20:42 <cindyli> might be what you need
2017-07-21T19:20:51 <simonjb> ok, yeah, I\'m thinking
2017-07-21T19:23:07 <cindyli> simonjb: i\'m thinking if you could do something similar like the test case holder for using pouchDB. the pouchdb gets reset in between each test sequence, within the same test case holder, this is how it waits for the pouchdb cleanup completes before starting the next test sequence: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/testing/src/PouchTestCaseHolder.js#L91

2017-07-21T19:38:48 <simonjb> cindyli, michelled: I got the multiple testEnvironments working
2017-07-21T19:39:01 <cindyli> yay, congrats
2017-07-21T19:39:42 <simonjb> I made a base testEnvironment and then extended that for the separate test sequences
2017-07-21T19:41:14 <michelled> simonjb: within a single testcaseholder?
2017-07-21T19:41:29 <simonjb> michelled: no, completely separate
2017-07-21T19:41:42 <simonjb> let me commit the code...
2017-07-21T19:45:33 <simonjb> michelled, cindyli: https://github.com/simonbates/co-occurrence-engine/blob/master/tests/CoOccurrenceEngineTests.js
2017-07-21T19:47:30 <cindyli> simonjb: quite neat, not much duplication
