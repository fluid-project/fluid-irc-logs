2017-09-27T16:40:46 <gtirloni_> cindyli: i changed the preferences config file parameters, could you try again?
2017-09-27T16:41:49 <cindyli> gtirloni_: where did you change? wondering what's to pull
2017-09-27T16:42:07 <gtirloni_> the preferences ansible role itself, it should pull automatically by vagrant up
2017-09-27T16:42:12 <cindyli> ah ok
2017-09-27T16:43:04 <cindyli> saw your change. that should work. trying...

2017-09-27T18:00:58 <simonjb> gtirloni_: thanks very much for sending the email about Docker
2017-09-27T18:02:11 <simonjb> so maybe on a Windows host, the best way is: vagrant up a linux box, and then run docker containers inside linux?
2017-09-27T18:03:11 <mrtyler> i believe that is a common pattern simonjb
2017-09-27T18:03:32 <mrtyler> maybe one of our windows developers has a different approach?
2017-09-27T18:04:09 <mrtyler> i realized the other day i've barely touched a windows box in >5 years. feels pretty good :)
2017-09-27T18:04:34 <mrtyler> (ofc the three years before that i spent a lot of time supporting visual studio 2005, so i guess i earned my escape)
2017-09-27T18:04:44 <simonjb> :)
2017-09-27T18:05:35 <gtirloni_> simonjb: seems like the quickest way. the only issue is if you want to expose some port to the host system (if you want to connect your browser to something running on the inside), then you'd have to edit Vagrantfile and expose that port.. and when running the container, do the same
2017-09-27T18:06:09 <gtirloni_> maybe we should add ports 9081/9082 to that vagrantfile by default
2017-09-27T18:06:31 <gtirloni_> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/Vagrantfile#L50-L51
2017-09-27T18:07:04 <gtirloni_> just duplicate that line, put 9081 or 9082 for all parameters there and run the containers inside (as in the email)
2017-09-27T18:08:16 * cindyli joined the channel
2017-09-27T18:08:54 <simonjb> gtirloni: hopefully we can meet soon and it would be awesome to sketch out the landscape: local dev, automated tests, CI, production deployment; and to figure out how to best support each case and to have maxiumu reuse
2017-09-27T18:09:22 <simonjb> I know this is something we have put a lot of work into
2017-09-27T18:09:27 <mrtyler> cindyli: if that ^ is what the meeting will be about, i'd like to attend
2017-09-27T18:09:52 <simonjb> but for me I'm feeling a little lost regarding the different technologies and approaches we are using
2017-09-27T18:10:04 <gtirloni> we should write down some use cases / stories of how people envision working with it all
2017-09-27T18:10:48 * the-t-in-rtf joined the channel
2017-09-27T18:10:54 <gtirloni> agreed, we have lots of different solutions (created at the time to solve particular needs, not representative of the average workflow or something we could commit to support fully)... i'm in favor of trimming as well :)
2017-09-27T18:11:11 <cindyli> sure, mrtyler
2017-09-27T18:12:46 <simonjb> we can maybe start with a summary of the current state of things
2017-09-27T18:13:46 <simonjb> I hope to not cause the need for lots of new work
2017-09-27T18:14:33 <simonjb> hopefully the stuff is all there and I just don't understand how it all fits together
2017-09-27T18:15:02 <simonjb> but will be really good to meet
