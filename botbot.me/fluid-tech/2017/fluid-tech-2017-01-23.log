2017-01-23T16:22:33 <mrtyler> good morning friends
2017-01-23T16:22:50 <mrtyler> no alanharnum...
2017-01-23T16:23:01 <mrtyler> gtirloni: i have a few things to discuss with you :)
2017-01-23T16:23:11 <mrtyler> amatas: i also have a thing or two to discuss with you :)
2017-01-23T16:23:36 <mrtyler> friday's slightly terrifying finding: https://www.terraform.io/docs/state/remote/index.html
2017-01-23T16:24:07 <mrtyler> the good news is i did terraform my first t2.micro in aws!
2017-01-23T16:27:39 <gtirloni> mrtyler: good morning, how does 10:30 your time work for you?
2017-01-23T16:28:07 <mrtyler> gtirloni: isn't that in the middle of the other meeting...?
2017-01-23T16:28:12 <mrtyler> apcp core team
2017-01-23T16:28:32 <mrtyler> otherwise that's fine for me
2017-01-23T16:29:43 <gtirloni> i wasn't aware of that meeting.. but any time for the next 4 hours works for me
2017-01-23T16:30:18 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-01-23T16:30:49 <mrtyler> gtirloni: interesting. i guess you're not apcp enough to come to it :)
2017-01-23T16:31:24 <mrtyler> gtirloni: ok that's fine. we can talk for a half hour now or i'll just ping you after the apcp meeting is over
2017-01-23T16:31:44 <mrtyler> actually first: i guess i need the admin password for ops@?
2017-01-23T16:31:51 <mrtyler> also should i be on ops-commits@?
2017-01-23T16:31:58 <mrtyler> or ops-notifications@?
2017-01-23T16:35:11 <mrtyler> i'll let you chew on that while i get some breakfast ;)
2017-01-23T16:36:25 <mrtyler> alanharnum: any update on container fun?
2017-01-23T16:39:10 <alanharnum> mrtyler: I made some progress locally on Friday morning and think I've got the GPII universal-based ones building again - I need to talk to someone more knowledgeable about GPII at this point (probably cindyli) to make sure the authentication configuration is working before working on the FDS service
2017-01-23T16:39:26 <alanharnum> had to switch off Friday afternoon to do some demo preparation, but will be back to it today
2017-01-23T16:39:41 <mrtyler> alanharnum: ok thx. lmk if i can help
2017-01-23T16:39:52 <alanharnum> mrtyler: will do - thanks
2017-01-23T16:39:56 <mrtyler> i didn't realize we had any auth at all. that's an exciting step
2017-01-23T16:40:50 <mrtyler> alanharnum: fyi i'm planning to go ahead with my plan which is 1. finish terraform aws tutorial. 2. practice checkpoint/restore with kvm. 3. start trying to terraform things on h-0004
2017-01-23T16:41:04 <mrtyler> will probably take a day or two but lmk if any of that makes you uncomfortable
2017-01-23T16:41:14 * clown_afk joined the channel
2017-01-23T16:41:48 <alanharnum> mrtyler: let me know when you start working on h-004, basically; I am hoping to have the service redeployable by tomorrow
2017-01-23T16:42:05 <mrtyler> will do; sounds good
2017-01-23T16:42:28 * clown joined the channel
2017-01-23T16:42:40 <mrtyler> also if i get with gio to fix up some other things i've found, that may delay my messing with h4 even further
2017-01-23T16:44:27 * cindyli joined the channel
2017-01-23T16:46:57 <gtirloni> mrtyler: sorry, quick meeting here. after the apcp meeting works for me.
2017-01-23T16:46:57 <gtirloni> mrtyler: password for ops@.. you can use the mailman's global one for all lists (i'll send it to you)
2017-01-23T16:46:57 <gtirloni> mrtyler: ops-commits gets updates from github and ops-notifications from uptimerobot/jenkins (good candidate to have split gpii-specific lists)
2017-01-23T16:58:30 <mrtyler> thx gio
