b'2017-06-07T14:39:39 <amatas> today the gitlab-ci runner of the h-0005 runs the tests of gpii-universal, gpii-windows, gpii-linux, gpii-nexus, vagrant build boxes..
2017-06-07T14:39:44 <mrtyler> but there are also multiple [[runners]] stanzas in /etc/gitlab-runner/config.toml
2017-06-07T14:39:47 <amatas> the gpii-* only for tests of gitlab-ci
2017-06-07T14:40:14 <amatas> https://gitlab.com/GPII-test
2017-06-07T14:40:17 <mrtyler> i think that situation will persist regardless of how i do the automation
2017-06-07T14:40:59 <amatas> if I remember well they are limited to 5 stanzas
2017-06-07T14:41:24 <mrtyler> that would be pretty annoying if true
2017-06-07T14:41:43 <amatas> what is annoying?
2017-06-07T14:42:01 <mrtyler> limiting to 5 stanzas
2017-06-07T14:42:13 <amatas> why?
2017-06-07T14:42:37 <mrtyler> because that\'s a pointless and arbitrary limitation?
2017-06-07T14:43:43 <amatas> it isn\'t arbitrary: https://gitlab.com/amatas/packer-win/pipelines/8366714
2017-06-07T14:44:04 <mrtyler> i don\'t understand what this link is supposed to teach me
2017-06-07T14:44:13 <amatas> I set that limitation to build each stage of the vms at the same time, leaving one stanza for other tests
2017-06-07T14:44:25 <mrtyler> we are talking about different things
2017-06-07T14:44:37 <mrtyler> you are talking about the limit on concurrent builds i guess?
2017-06-07T14:44:46 <amatas> yes
2017-06-07T14:44:55 <mrtyler> i\'m talking about the number of projects a gitlab-runner is registered to
2017-06-07T14:44:56 <amatas> I\'m talking about the concurrent builds
2017-06-07T14:45:05 * michelled has quit
2017-06-07T14:45:31 <mrtyler> yeah i already answered that
2017-06-07T14:45:39 <mrtyler> [07.08:36:01] <        mrtyler> | it\'s a single gitlab-runner per build node, so afaict any limits on number of builds would apply
2017-06-07T14:45:42 <mrtyler> [07.08:36:06] <        mrtyler> | regardless of number of projects configured
2017-06-07T14:46:02 <mrtyler> my understanding could be wrong but that\'s my read
2017-06-07T14:46:35 <amatas> ok, wait a sec, one single gitlab-runner can be registered to multiple projects I didn\'t know that
2017-06-07T14:46:54 <mrtyler> our single gitlab-runner builds all the projects today, right?
2017-06-07T14:47:23 <amatas> yes, but it\'s registered only one time, I see at each project the same runner-id
2017-06-07T14:48:19 <mrtyler> the distinct runner-ids (like gpii-terraform-live) still resolve to the same gitlab-runner process on the build node
2017-06-07T14:48:20 <amatas> and in your terraform repositories I see different runner-ids which made me understand multiple gitlab-ci-runners
2017-06-07T14:48:31 <mrtyler> so my expectation is that they\'re all treated as a single gitlab-runner, but that could be incorrect
2017-06-07T14:48:32 <amatas> ok
2017-06-07T14:49:13 <mrtyler> anyway i guess your point is you think that if we have distinct registrations, the concurrent limits will be multiplied by the number of registrations?
2017-06-07T14:49:25 <mrtyler> and then we would overwhelm the build node
2017-06-07T14:50:02 <amatas> yes, that is my concern
2017-06-07T14:50:21 <mrtyler> i guess we\'d have to test it
2017-06-07T14:50:37 <mrtyler> but since your solution is to just have one registration, not really relevant today
2017-06-07T14:52:39 <amatas> I proposed that solution because my concern about the lost of the control of the number of concurrent builds
2017-06-07T14:53:25 <mrtyler> aha
2017-06-07T14:53:41 <mrtyler> so let\'s say i\'m right and the concurrent build limit is "global" for all registrations using a single gitlab-runner
2017-06-07T14:53:44 <mrtyler> (i\'ll test this to make sure)
2017-06-07T14:53:52 <mrtyler> can we talk about an automation strategy?
2017-06-07T14:54:22 <amatas> I can do so
2017-06-07T14:54:23 <mrtyler> or do you prefer manual configuration for each repo
2017-06-07T14:54:26 <amatas> we* can do so
2017-06-07T14:54:46 <amatas> I prefer automation if it\'s possible
2017-06-07T14:54:52 <mrtyler> me too :)
2017-06-07T14:55:12 <mrtyler> i think it would look something like this:
2017-06-07T14:55:40 <mrtyler> ansible has a list of all gitlab repos: name + registration token (unique per repo)
2017-06-07T14:55:58 <mrtyler> so we\'d ahve a bunch of registrations: gpii-terraform, gpii-terraform-live, gpii-windows, gpii-linux, ...
2017-06-07T14:56:12 <mrtyler> ansible handles the registrations automatically
2017-06-07T14:56:30 <mrtyler> when you create a new build node, you run ansible and everything is registered
2017-06-07T14:57:24 <amatas> that could work, but be sure that we can limit the concurrent builds at the same host
2017-06-07T14:57:37 <mrtyler> yes we\'re assuming the concurrent build limit is global
2017-06-07T14:57:59 <mrtyler> a downside is that there are a bunch of "unused" registrations. i.e. gpii-terraform sees (but does not use) gpii-linux-builder, gpii-universal-builder, ...
2017-06-07T14:58:10 <mrtyler> gpii-terraform has only the gpii-terraform-builder enabled
2017-06-07T14:58:42 <mrtyler> which could be slightly confusing but which i don\'t think is a big deal, especially since the config will mostly be automated
2017-06-07T14:59:07 <mrtyler> adding a new gitlab repo to be built requires adding that repo\'s name and registration token to ansible, run ansible, done
2017-06-07T14:59:08 <amatas> yes, we are going to have a registration per project in the ci setup page
2017-06-07T15:00:04 <mrtyler> well to be clear: we\'ll have an ENABLED RUNNER per project no matter what
2017-06-07T15:00:06 <amatas> if you add a new repo, will be all the previous runners registered again?
2017-06-07T15:00:40 <mrtyler> but we\'ll either have ONE REGISTERED RUNNER (also enabled) or MULTIPLE REGISTERED RUNNERS (with only the "right" one enabled)
2017-06-07T15:01:09 <mrtyler> amatas: no. the ansible role only registers a runner if it can\'t find that registration already
2017-06-07T15:01:15 <mrtyler> let me link you some code...
2017-06-07T15:01:29 <mrtyler> https://github.com/DBLaci/ansible-gitlab-runner/blob/master/tasks/register-runner.yml#L24
2017-06-07T15:02:00 <mrtyler> note the when: at the end
2017-06-07T15:05:24 <amatas> ok
2017-06-07T15:06:07 <mrtyler> (i have a different question when we\'re done talking about this one)
2017-06-07T15:06:24 <amatas> ok, go ahead
2017-06-07T15:06:46 <mrtyler> i\'m thinking that i will NOT do any registration during tests
2017-06-07T15:06:55 <mrtyler> because it ties tests to a third party thing (gitlab)
2017-06-07T15:07:08 <mrtyler> and because it\'s not obvious how to clean up registrations created only for testing
2017-06-07T15:07:28 <mrtyler> so tests will set up gitlab-runner inside vagrant with molecule
2017-06-07T15:07:39 <mrtyler> but they won\'t actually register in tests. only in "production"
2017-06-07T15:07:42 <mrtyler> does that seem fair?
2017-06-07T15:08:38 <amatas> seems fair
2017-06-07T15:08:54 <mrtyler> ok cool
2017-06-07T15:09:37 <mrtyler> i think that\'s it for now
2017-06-07T15:09:47 <mrtyler> i\'ll keep banging on this and see what happens
2017-06-07T15:09:59 <mrtyler> one more topic:
2017-06-07T15:10:13 <amatas> ok, I\'ll be over here if you want to discuss anything
2017-06-07T15:10:29 <mrtyler> am i still doing my demo on thursday? isn\'t that one of the days gtirloni is busy with demo-babysitting?
2017-06-07T15:10:50 <mrtyler> also were you going to make a calendar invite for that?
2017-06-07T15:11:22 <mrtyler> also if sandra or colinclark want to see it, they\'ll still be in meetings on thursday afaik
2017-06-07T15:11:39 <mrtyler> i was going to announce it at the meeting today in case other people wanted to attend
2017-06-07T15:11:42 <mrtyler> is why i\'m asking
2017-06-07T15:11:48 <colinclark> yeah, i\'m cooked all day thursday
2017-06-07T15:11:53 <colinclark> as is gtirloni
2017-06-07T15:11:57 <mrtyler> colinclark: how much do you care about this demo?
2017-06-07T15:12:00 <colinclark> presenting to the steering committee
2017-06-07T15:12:17 <colinclark> I care a lot about demos in general :)
2017-06-07T15:12:20 <mrtyler> altho if gio is out, i think it\'s useful for him to see
2017-06-07T15:12:33 <colinclark> but if you want to schedule something and then I take a look later, that\'s totally cool
2017-06-07T15:12:46 <mrtyler> we could just punt to next monday\'s regular weekly devops meeting
2017-06-07T15:12:59 <mrtyler> i could also record it with GTM i guess
2017-06-07T15:13:48 <amatas> mrtyler: whenever is better for all of us, I suggested the thursday because gtirloni said that he will be "cooked" the beggining of this week.
2017-06-07T15:14:15 <amatas> mrtyler: next monday works for me
2017-06-07T15:14:35 <mrtyler> monday seems simplest to me
2017-06-07T15:15:09 <amatas> I\'ll be on vacation from tuesday to the next monday
2017-06-07T15:17:09 <mrtyler> unrelated: my favorite tweet this week: https://twitter.com/stephenjmolloy/status/871799913528602627
2017-06-07T15:24:48 <amatas> :D, in spanish is "teethpaste"
2017-06-07T15:25:19 <amatas> well, at least in Spain...
2017-06-07T15:28:42 <mrtyler> heh, i guess so
2017-06-07T15:28:47 <mrtyler> also teethbrush (cepilla de dientes)

2017-06-07T19:23:28 <gtirloni> amatas: do you know if we\'re using long polling with our runners?
2017-06-07T19:23:49 <amatas> no idea
2017-06-07T19:24:27 <gtirloni> no worries, i read about it in a blog post from gitlab but wasn\'t sure if it\'s now the default or not (i was wondering what\'s the delay on running new jobs, if it\'s a second/minute interval or if with long polling it\'s faster)
2017-06-07T19:25:17 <amatas> it\'s almost instant
2017-06-07T19:25:46 <amatas> every time I trigger a new pipeline I see that it\'s already started when I click on the log console
2017-06-07T19:25:51 <gtirloni> cool, that\'s the long polling them (a.k.a. push with firewalls)
2017-06-07T19:25:55 <gtirloni> then
2017-06-07T19:26:14 <gtirloni> pretty nice solution they have
2017-06-07T19:26:50 * colinclark has quit
2017-06-07T19:28:26 <amatas> yes, we don\'t need to care about the network connectivity

2017-06-07T13:57:16 <mrtyler> amatas: buenas tardes
2017-06-07T13:57:30 <mrtyler> can we chat about gitlab-runner?
2017-06-07T13:57:47 <amatas> buenas mrtyler
2017-06-07T13:57:52 <amatas> sure
2017-06-07T13:57:57 * avtar joined the channel
2017-06-07T13:58:36 <mrtyler> first some good news: i have gitlab-runner running inside molecule
2017-06-07T13:58:45 <mrtyler> https://gitlab.com/gpii-ops/gpii-terraform/settings/ci_cd
2017-06-07T13:58:49 <mrtyler> https://gitlab.com/gpii-ops/gpii-terraform-live/settings/ci_cd
2017-06-07T13:59:01 <amatas> awesome
2017-06-07T14:00:27 <mrtyler> question 1: how do we handle gitlab-runner registration? it looks like the runner needs to be registered with each gitlab project (which is why there are distinct runners for gpii-terraform and gpii-terraform-live)
2017-06-07T14:00:47 <mrtyler> are we going to maintain a list in ansible of every gitlab project, so the runner registers with each gitlab project?
2017-06-07T14:00:55 <mrtyler> or is there a better way?
2017-06-07T14:01:11 <mrtyler> i tried to look at some of the pre-existing gitlab setups but i don\'t have permissions to see settings
2017-06-07T14:01:34 <amatas> yes, once the runner is registered in gitlab.com you have to enable it manually using the gitlab.com interface
2017-06-07T14:01:54 <mrtyler> that is not true
2017-06-07T14:01:59 <amatas> I don\'t know if there is an API call or similar for that
2017-06-07T14:02:07 <mrtyler> you can register from the build node, using the cli
2017-06-07T14:02:41 <amatas> yes, register can be performed from the node, but by default is disabled at the project in gitlab.com
2017-06-07T14:02:41 <mrtyler> anyway it sounds like your plan would be to configure the runner once automatically, then by hand for each repo that uses the runner?
2017-06-07T14:02:55 <mrtyler> that is not correct
2017-06-07T14:03:10 <mrtyler> source: i never touched anything in the gitlab web interface, yet my runner shows up as registered
2017-06-07T14:03:54 <amatas> is your runner with the button "Enable for this project" enabled by default?
2017-06-07T14:04:17 <mrtyler> yes
2017-06-07T14:04:21 <mrtyler> i mean no
2017-06-07T14:04:31 <mrtyler> by default it says "remove runner" because it\'s already enabled
2017-06-07T14:04:45 <mrtyler> i\'ll show you if you want
2017-06-07T14:04:53 <amatas> ok, interesting, that should be changed in the latest releases
2017-06-07T14:05:26 <mrtyler> it should be changed? like this behavior is going away? why would this not be the right way for the runner registration to behave?
2017-06-07T14:05:42 <avtar> amatas, mrtyler: https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/api/runners.html#enable-a-runner-in-project
2017-06-07T14:05:43 <amatas> I can see that it\'s enabled in the gpii-terraform-live project
2017-06-07T14:06:07 <avtar> you just need to know the project\'s and runner\'s IDs
2017-06-07T14:06:12 <mrtyler> avtar: neat. the gitlab-runner has a register command that wraps that api
2017-06-07T14:06:27 <mrtyler> fyi
2017-06-07T14:06:33 <avtar> nice :D
2017-06-07T14:07:15 <mrtyler> definitely easier than mucking around with curl -X POST
2017-06-07T14:08:22 <avtar> i can\'t verify this at the moment but i have a hunch that the register subcommand only registers a runner with an account
2017-06-07T14:08:34 <amatas> sorry mrtyler, I said it wrong, I meant that that behavior (change the status to enabled by default) must have change in the latest releases of the gitlab.com because it didn\'t work in the past
2017-06-07T14:08:39 <mrtyler> i don\'t understand the distinction avtar
2017-06-07T14:08:47 <mrtyler> amatas: ok
2017-06-07T14:08:59 <avtar> then that post request is required to make a project use the previously registered (with a gitlab account) runner
2017-06-07T14:09:31 <amatas> also I see that the shared runners are disabled
2017-06-07T14:10:59 <amatas> mmm, I see that there is a runner per project, is that correct mrtyler?
2017-06-07T14:11:47 <mrtyler> avtar: gitlab-runner cli handles all of this
2017-06-07T14:11:50 <mrtyler> amatas: where are you seeing the shared runners as disabled?
2017-06-07T14:12:06 <amatas> https://gitlab.com/gpii-ops/test_project/settings/ci_cd
2017-06-07T14:12:10 <amatas> sorry
2017-06-07T14:12:14 <mrtyler> amatas: yes, because it\'s the only way i could figure out to do it, i think. if you have a way to not do it that way, that\'s one of the things i\'m asking about
2017-06-07T14:12:27 <mrtyler> amatas: i\'m not using test_project. i\'m using the two projects i linked you to
2017-06-07T14:12:29 <amatas> https://gitlab.com/gpii-ops/gpii-terraform-live/settings/ci_cd <- here they are disabled
2017-06-07T14:12:45 <mrtyler> amatas: you don\'t see this?:
2017-06-07T14:12:46 <mrtyler> Runners activated for this project
2017-06-07T14:12:46 <mrtyler> 37947771 Remove Runner
2017-06-07T14:12:46 <mrtyler> #168983
2017-06-07T14:12:46 <mrtyler> ansible-gpii-ci-worker-gpii-terraform-live
2017-06-07T14:13:03 <mrtyler> admittedly i haven\'t tried to run a build yet, but that looks enabled to me
2017-06-07T14:13:49 <amatas> "Shared runners" the right side of that page, with a green button that allows you to enable them if you want. In the past those shared runners were enabled by default
2017-06-07T14:14:00 <mrtyler> oh shared runners, sorry
2017-06-07T14:14:15 <mrtyler> i may have disabled those by hand last week
2017-06-07T14:15:02 <mrtyler> shared runners are probably not handled with gitlab-runner cli
2017-06-07T14:15:16 <amatas> I don\'t think so as well
2017-06-07T14:16:42 <amatas> I guess that if  you register a runner using the token of a particular project, that runner will be enabled by default for such project
2017-06-07T14:16:47 <mrtyler> i think the shared runner problem is out of scope. i\'m worried about the build node end
2017-06-07T14:16:57 <mrtyler> i believe that is correct
2017-06-07T14:21:42 <amatas> I guess that an alternative could be to register a runner per tech i.e. ansible, vagrant and then enable the runners at the repositories. This approach could help us to control the amount of instances of each runner running at the same time.
2017-06-07T14:23:04 <amatas> the registration of the runner is inside the scope of the task. The setup of the CI at the repository could be handle by hand, I don\'t think that that requires a lot of effort. In addition, the repositories only will be setup one time.
2017-06-07T14:23:04 <mrtyler> so you want to handle registration manually?
2017-06-07T14:23:31 <amatas> nono, the registration of the runner could be automatically, with a token.
2017-06-07T14:23:49 * simonjb joined the channel
2017-06-07T14:23:58 <mrtyler> ok walk me through the process of setting up a new build node
2017-06-07T14:24:12 <amatas> once the runner is available to be enabled at the repositories we can do it manually
2017-06-07T14:24:47 <mrtyler> ok. how do i register a runner with something other than a specific project
2017-06-07T14:24:56 <mrtyler> i.e. can i register a runner with the gpii-ops organization?
2017-06-07T14:25:10 <amatas> new build node, I imagine these steps: 1. install the gitlab-ci-runner on the host, 2. register the runner using a token, 3. check that is available in gitlab.com (if it\'s possible)
2017-06-07T14:25:12 <mrtyler> what token do i use?
2017-06-07T14:25:32 <mrtyler> for 2.
2017-06-07T14:25:53 <amatas> I guess that any token of the gpii-ops organization should work
2017-06-07T14:26:34 <amatas> in fact, I\'m able to enable the runners that you registered in this project: https://gitlab.com/gpii-ops/test_project/settings/ci_cd
2017-06-07T14:27:21 <mrtyler> hm ok. so which project should i use. test_project?
2017-06-07T14:27:47 <mrtyler> dedicated project to be a stable target for gitlab runner registration (like gpii-gitlab-runner-registration)?
2017-06-07T14:28:16 <amatas> that is a good idea
2017-06-07T14:28:28 <mrtyler> ok
2017-06-07T14:29:16 <mrtyler> and what you\'re telling me is: we\'re going to do runner-per-project config by hand. so if we ever move the build node (i.e. from h5 to a box in the cloud), we will manually update every repo that was built by that build node
2017-06-07T14:30:25 <amatas> yes, ATM
2017-06-07T14:30:48 <amatas> we can automate the process using the API call that avtar sent before
2017-06-07T14:32:00 <mrtyler> again: the gitlab-runner cli already knows how to do that. and so does the ansible role that manages gitlab-runner
2017-06-07T14:32:25 <mrtyler> anyway that is a plan. thanks for the input amatas and avtar
2017-06-07T14:32:46 * kasparnet has quit
2017-06-07T14:33:45 * kasparnet joined the channel
2017-06-07T14:34:54 <amatas> mrtyler: yes, but you have to register one runner per project and we could lost the feature of controlling the number of instances that must run at the same time, and it can be so in the case of intense creation of the VMs at the same time.
2017-06-07T14:35:07 <amatas> that is my concern
2017-06-07T14:35:57 <mrtyler> it\'s a single gitlab-runner per build node, so afaict any limits on number of builds would apply
2017-06-07T14:36:02 <mrtyler> regardless of number of projects configured
2017-06-07T14:36:07 <mrtyler> is that wrong?
2017-06-07T14:37:09 <amatas> a single gitlab-runner per build node?, so if we have 15 projects with one runner per project, do we need 15 build nodes?. Sorry I just trying to understand.
2017-06-07T14:37:23 <mrtyler> no, it\'s exactly like it is today
2017-06-07T14:37:32 <mrtyler> so yes, one gitlab-runner per build node
2017-06-07T14:37:45 <mrtyler> but one build node is fine, as we have it today
2017-06-07T14:38:13 * kasparnet has quit
2017-06-07T14:38:37 <mrtyler> actually, hmm
2017-06-07T14:39:25 <mrtyler> now i\'m not so sure. there is only one gitlab-runner process running, so i think i\'m still right
