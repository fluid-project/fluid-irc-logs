2017-02-13T15:39:15 <michelled> avtar1: can I use gpii-webdriver to test the electron app?
2017-02-13T15:40:52 <michelled> I\'m guessing it doesn\'t quite give me what I want to test, for example the actual task tray in the OS UI
2017-02-13T15:42:34 <avtar1> michelled: my guess is that will depend on electron APIs and whether you can access the task tray using them
2017-02-13T15:43:13 <avtar1> https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/tutorial/using-selenium-and-webdriver.md
2017-02-13T15:47:42 <avtar1> had to look that up http://electron.atom.io/docs/api/tray/
2017-02-13T15:48:58 <avtar1> you\'ll probably need a solution that can interact with the os itself
2017-02-13T15:58:22 <michelled> thx avtar1
2017-02-13T16:03:45 <avtar1> michelled: still poking around the electron docs, this looks interesting as well https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/api/web-contents.md#contentssendinputeventevent
2017-02-13T16:08:00 <cindyli> avtar1: I\'m working on https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-1987 and created 2 data loaders to load prefs and auth data into couchdb. I\'m now modifying the vagrant scripts that sets up the GPII production VM in "universal". having a problem now. would you have time today to pair up on that?
2017-02-13T16:08:01 <avtar1> but still in the realm of the browser window itself
2017-02-13T16:09:39 <avtar1> cindyli: probably for an hour in the afternoon
2017-02-13T16:09:41 <avtar1> i\'ll be at the office after standup
2017-02-13T16:09:57 <avtar1> what\'s the issue you\'re encountering?

2017-02-13T16:11:29 <cindyli> avtar1: the error - http://pastebin.com/Py6qTTP5
2017-02-13T16:11:57 <cindyli> it tries to copy production json file from a wrong source dir
2017-02-13T16:12:13 <the-t-in-rtf> @avtar Hi, just came online to chat with my wife, I\'m taking care of my son at the moment.
2017-02-13T16:12:21 <the-t-in-rtf> Chat away, but it may be a bit before I can answer.
2017-02-13T16:12:27 <the-t-in-rtf> I have time to meet up tomorrow if you like.
2017-02-13T16:12:35 <cindyli> avtar1: this dir is defined at https://github.com/gpii-ops/ansible-preferences-server/blob/master/defaults/main.yml#L7
2017-02-13T16:13:08 <cindyli> i wonder how i can overwrite this dir
2017-02-13T16:13:13 <cindyli> override
2017-02-13T16:13:24 <avtar1> the-t-in-rtf: no worries. just wanted to point out a question that michelled asked a few mins ago regarding electron, webdriver, and probing a system tray https://botbot.me/freenode/fluid-tech/2017-02-13/?msg=80895822&page=1
2017-02-13T16:16:34 <cindyli> avtar1: the changes i made in universal - https://github.com/cindyli/universal/commit/521f72c2bdc5c1e0f781150cce92c19d2933fb39
2017-02-13T16:19:46 <avtar1> cindyli: taking a look
2017-02-13T16:19:56 <cindyli> thanks

2017-02-13T16:31:57 <avtar1> cindyli: this filename change will require a pr but you should be able to override it using an environment variable
2017-02-13T16:33:04 <cindyli> avtar1: the interesting thing is it didn\'t happen before with the same repo, so i wonder if i did something silly

2017-02-13T19:32:00 <the-t-in-rtf> @avtar @michelled, gpii-webdriver is a different stack than the previous work with electron (Nightmare.js).
2017-02-13T19:32:08 <the-t-in-rtf> It\'s basically selenium but with a standard behind it.
2017-02-13T19:32:15 <the-t-in-rtf> it tests browsers, period.
2017-02-13T19:32:58 <the-t-in-rtf> The previous work with NIghtmare also only tested browsers, and only the specific pseudo-real browser they created.
2017-02-13T19:33:22 <the-t-in-rtf> Kavya has done more recent work in the OS-level testing area, you should talk with her.
