2017-07-14T13:42:54 <gtirloni> amatas: how often are we building the windows boxes? monthly?
2017-07-14T13:43:11 <amatas> gtirloni: is manually triggered
2017-07-14T13:43:43 <amatas> I started a new build because I added a script to mount v: to the vagrant shared directory
2017-07-14T13:44:03 <amatas> but now the builds are limited to 1 at a time
2017-07-14T13:44:22 <gtirloni> cool, thank you. let\'s see if the aborted builds decrease
2017-07-14T13:44:33 <amatas> ok
2017-07-14T13:44:46 <amatas> anyway the last time I run the build was months ago
2017-07-14T13:48:25 <gtirloni> yeah, i don\'t think it\'s related to the tabbable issue
2017-07-14T13:49:02 <gtirloni> maybe it\'s the same issue if we get a lot of jobs from jenkins at the same time too

2017-07-14T16:06:41 <simonjb> gtirloni: I\'m having trouble running the GPII windows vagrant box -- I get stuck at "default: WinRM transport: negotiate" and then it times out
2017-07-14T16:07:36 <gtirloni> I\'ve never seen this error. Any ideas, amatas?
2017-07-14T16:07:43 <simonjb> I\'m running vagrant 1.9.5 -- do you think that could be the problem? should I go back to 1.8.x?
2017-07-14T16:07:47 <gtirloni> simonjb: are you using windows10-eval-x64-Apps box?
2017-07-14T16:07:55 <gtirloni> vagrant 1.9.x should be fine
2017-07-14T16:08:04 <gtirloni> is the box updated?
2017-07-14T16:08:52 <simonjb> yes, inclusivedesign/windows10-eval-x64-Apps and I just downloaded it this morning
2017-07-14T16:09:50 <simonjb> VirtualBox 5.0.40_Ubuntu r115130 (16.04 LTS)
2017-07-14T16:10:43 <gtirloni> I\'d try to upgrade to VBox 5.1.22 if possible, and vagrant 1.9.7
2017-07-14T16:13:30 <simonjb> thanks gtirloni, I\'ll try updating vagrant first as that\'s easiest
2017-07-14T16:13:55 <simonjb> unless it\'s worth increasing the timeout, in case it\'s just really slow?
2017-07-14T16:15:03 <simonjb> the VM comes up and I can see the Windows desktop but there is no visible activity
2017-07-14T16:28:48 <gtirloni> i\'m downloading the box to try to reproduce it
2017-07-14T16:35:35 <simonjb> same with vagrant 1.9.7
2017-07-14T16:35:49 <simonjb> (still VirtualBal 5.0.40)
2017-07-14T16:36:02 <simonjb> (still VirtualBox 5.0.40)
2017-07-14T16:39:20 <simonjb> will update VirtualBox now

2017-07-14T17:17:57 <amatas> gtirloni_ I\'m building a new windows 10 vagrant box, based on creators update and with the v: mounted
2017-07-14T17:18:07 <amatas> I hope it solves several issues
2017-07-14T17:19:06 <simonjb> gtirloni_, amatas: I\'ve updated to vagrant 1.9.7 and virtualbox 5.1.22 but still get stuck at the same point
2017-07-14T17:19:58 <simonjb> "default: WinRM transport: negotiate"
2017-07-14T17:20:02 <simonjb> and then time out
2017-07-14T17:20:31 <simonjb> amatas: do you think there\'s something I can fix on my machine or should I wait for the new box?
2017-07-14T17:20:33 <amatas> simonjb: I saw this behavior before, and the only way that I found to solve it was reloading the VM "vagrant reload"
2017-07-14T17:21:01 <simonjb> amatas: will that provision correctly?
2017-07-14T17:21:10 <amatas> simonjb: It happens for me since windows shows the dialog that the license is about to expire
2017-07-14T17:21:22 <simonjb> ok
2017-07-14T17:21:29 <amatas> the new vm has other 90 days of trial
2017-07-14T17:22:18 <simonjb> amatas: when do you estimate that it will be ready?
2017-07-14T17:22:20 <amatas> yes, my "workaround" lets me provision the VM and the VM works normally
2017-07-14T17:22:30 <simonjb> ok, will try that
2017-07-14T17:22:43 <amatas> I only have to test it and upload to the Atlas: https://gitlab.com/amatas/packer-win/-/jobs/22517928
2017-07-14T17:22:55 <amatas> I\'m going to do so right now
2017-07-14T17:24:41 <simonjb> amatas: should I vagrant reload --provision ?
2017-07-14T17:25:06 <amatas> first reload, then provision. It\'s what I do
2017-07-14T17:25:20 <amatas> I check that the reload works well
2017-07-14T17:25:49 <simonjb> so \'vagrant reload\' then \'vagrant provision\' ?
2017-07-14T17:26:03 <amatas> right
2017-07-14T17:29:02 <gtirloni_> if it\'s a license issue, you can try this in a admin prompt: slmgr -rearm
2017-07-14T17:34:39 <simonjb> amatas: I\'m still stuck at "default: WinRM transport: negotiate" after restarting the vm -- I\'ll wait for the new box
2017-07-14T17:35:29 <amatas> simonjb: did you see this behavior before with the same setup and Vagrant box?
2017-07-14T17:36:03 <amatas> I mean one month ago
2017-07-14T17:36:07 <amatas> or so
2017-07-14T17:36:16 <simonjb> amatas: this is the first time that I\'ve tried to run the windows box on this computer
2017-07-14T17:36:33 <amatas> ok
2017-07-14T17:37:07 <simonjb> or, rather I\'ve run on this physical computer but not this OS (switched from openSUSE to Ubuntu)
2017-07-14T17:37:08 <amatas> do you have any vagrant plugins installed?
2017-07-14T17:37:25 <simonjb> I don\'t think so
2017-07-14T17:37:35 <amatas> "vagrant plugin list"
2017-07-14T17:37:58 <simonjb> vagrant-share (1.1.9, system)
2017-07-14T17:38:05 <simonjb> one entry
2017-07-14T17:38:09 <amatas> ok
2017-07-14T17:38:23 <amatas> sometimes old plugins cause errors
2017-07-14T17:39:04 <simonjb> yeah, I\'m not seeing an \'error\' as such just a failure for vagrant to contact the vm
2017-07-14T17:41:29 <simonjb> interestingly vagrant halt also failed to work -- it sat waiting
2017-07-14T17:41:48 <simonjb> so I shutdown the vm using the windows gui
2017-07-14T17:42:24 <amatas> simonjb: do you see if the Windows boot ends or, is the virtual hard disk still reading when you get the winrm timeout?
2017-07-14T17:42:52 <amatas> yes it seems that vagrant is unable to connect with the vm using winrm
2017-07-14T17:43:23 <amatas> that can be produced by some network issue (firewall activated) or wrong network parameters
2017-07-14T17:43:50 <simonjb> I don\'t think there\'s virtual hard disk activity but there is network activity
2017-07-14T17:43:51 <amatas> also the winrm service can have some problems to start
2017-07-14T17:44:11 <simonjb> could it be a networking issue on my computer?
2017-07-14T17:44:14 <simonjb> on my host
2017-07-14T17:44:35 <amatas> I don\'t remember if ubuntu has a firewall activated by default
2017-07-14T17:44:52 <amatas> but if so I\'d try disabling it and run the vagrant commands
2017-07-14T17:46:17 <simonjb> amatas: I believe I don\'t have a firewall running but will investigate
2017-07-14T17:46:33 <amatas> run as root: iptables -L
2017-07-14T17:47:04 <amatas> just to see if there are any rule activated
2017-07-14T17:47:12 <simonjb> all ACCEPT
2017-07-14T17:47:24 <amatas> ok

2017-07-14T17:58:15 <simonjb> gtirloni_: I can test, I believe that the centos7 was -- what\'s the best way for me to verify?
2017-07-14T17:58:40 <gtirloni_> vagrant init inclusivedesign/centos7 && vagrant up && vagrant ssh  (same for fedora26)
2017-07-14T18:03:48 <simonjb> gtirloni_: centos7 is fine, trying fedora26 now
2017-07-14T18:03:53 <gtirloni_> cool
