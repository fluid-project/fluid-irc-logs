2017-07-31T13:26:21 <alanharnum> Justin_o: so I was looking more at scaffolding Friday afternoon & ca
2017-07-31T13:26:28 <alanharnum> came across this: https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-init/issues/31
2017-07-31T13:26:46 <alanharnum> it appears from the repo at https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-init that grunt-init is no longer under active development in favour of Yeoman
2017-07-31T13:27:11 <alanharnum> although it's a bit difficult to find a real confirming statement of that
2017-07-31T13:27:31 * simonjb joined the channel
2017-07-31T13:30:04 <Justin_o> alanharnum: yes, doesn't look like any real work since June or 2014
2017-07-31T13:30:05 <Justin_o> :(
2017-07-31T13:31:33 <alanharnum> it still seems functional for basic scaffolding, but Yeoman does a lot more (and is correspondingly more complicated)
2017-07-31T13:34:12 <Justin_o> alanharnum: i'm trying to read yeoman's commit log, it looks like just readme stuff for the last few years.. maybe i'm missing something or in the wrong repo https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman
2017-07-31T13:34:41 <Justin_o> alanharnum: maybe it's this repo https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman
2017-07-31T13:34:43 <Justin_o> oops
2017-07-31T13:34:50 * grrrero joined the channel
2017-07-31T13:34:50 <Justin_o> https://github.com/yeoman/yo
2017-07-31T13:36:27 <Justin_o> alanharnum: at any rate, the http://yeoman.io site looks a lot better than that last time i looked at it. At that time I had no idea what it actually was trying to do
2017-07-31T13:37:28 <alanharnum> Justin_o: as far as I can tell from reading a few issue threads (like https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/issues/432) is that Yeoman may have some lineage with grunt-init, or wrapped grunt-init to start, and may initially have been conceived as a competing task runner style tool
2017-07-31T13:37:39 <alanharnum> but has refocused in the last few years on being a scaffolding framework only
2017-07-31T13:38:11 <Justin_o> that makes sense
2017-07-31T13:41:16 <Justin_o> alanharnum: i can't recall was there another scaffolding tool you were looking into as well?
2017-07-31T13:41:43 <alanharnum> nope - was looking at grunt-init, then looked at Yeoman
2017-07-31T13:45:29 <alanharnum> all that said it wasn't too hard to write a basic generator: https://github.com/waharnum/generator-infusion
2017-07-31T13:55:04 <Justin_o> alanharnum: cool, so if i understand it correctly, this basically preps things for creating new infusion based projects?
2017-07-31T13:55:23 <alanharnum> Justin_o: yup
2017-07-31T13:55:30 <alanharnum> it's pretty basic right now
2017-07-31T13:55:38 <Justin_o> great, and it includes our linting rules?
2017-07-31T13:55:45 <Justin_o> also, which version of infusion would it pull down?
2017-07-31T13:56:44 <Justin_o> alanharnum: i think as an added feature of possible it might be useful to distinguish between browser and node based infusion projects, and setup the necessary copying grunt tasks for browser based ones
2017-07-31T13:58:09 <alanharnum> Justin_o: yeah, agree on both
2017-07-31T13:58:19 <alanharnum> ATM it just does browser-based and refers to node_modules
2017-07-31T13:59:25 <alanharnum> Yeoman has a bit of a weird syntax (to me, at least) and uses a lot of ES6 features, but I found it pretty straightforward after some initial learning curve
2017-07-31T13:59:32 <Justin_o> alanharnum: great, and once grrrero has the icon font build work in place, maybe we could add that as well.

2017-07-31T14:32:27 <grrrero> This one: http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/UnderstandingInfusionComponents.html
2017-07-31T14:32:32 <grrrero> or http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/tutorial-developerIntroduction/DeveloperIntroductionToInfusionFramework-Components.html
2017-07-31T14:32:40 <alanharnum> grrrero: second one
2017-07-31T14:32:49 <grrrero> Ok thanks alanharnum
2017-07-31T14:32:59 <alanharnum> caveat of bias because i wrote second one
