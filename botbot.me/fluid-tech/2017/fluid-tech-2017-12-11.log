2017-12-11T15:07:57 <simonjb> hi Bosmon and colinclark, I'd like to arrange a meeting with Clayton on Thursday Dec 14 this week, he is available 12pm or 3pm Eastern, do either of those times work for you?
2017-12-11T15:08:35 <Bosmon> Hi yes, I think the 3pm slot is better for me
2017-12-11T15:08:46 <colinclark> yup works for me
2017-12-11T15:08:56 <simonjb> awesome, thanks guys

2017-12-11T20:42:41 <simonjb> colinclark: here's what gtirloni_ and I have so far for the Nexus https://github.com/simonbates/nexus-dist
2017-12-11T20:43:35 <colinclark> looks like it's shaping up really nicely
2017-12-11T20:44:35 <simonjb> colinclark: do you have thoughts on things we should add or change?
2017-12-11T20:45:08 <colinclark> i don't at the moment
2017-12-11T20:45:10 <simonjb> the repo is at 'simonbates/nexus-dist' but we have some references to 'GPII/nexus-dist'
2017-12-11T20:45:58 <simonjb> to get it into GPII, we'll need someone to create the repo and merge in
2017-12-11T20:46:28 <simonjb> or change ownership
2017-12-11T20:46:57 <simonjb> colinclark: do you think it's important to have it at GPII/nexus-dist for the report?
2017-12-11T20:47:04 <colinclark> not massively
2017-12-11T20:47:08 <colinclark> but it's ideal
2017-12-11T20:47:58 <simonjb> I don't know if this is something that Bosmon has any time for?
2017-12-11T20:48:18 <simonjb> Bosmon: gtirloni_ and I have been making a 'packaged' version of Nexus
2017-12-11T20:48:28 <simonjb> it's at https://github.com/simonbates/nexus-dist
2017-12-11T20:49:06 <simonjb> it's base Nexus + Visible Nexus + Co-Occurrence Engine, with Docker and Vagrant runners
2017-12-11T20:50:03 <simonjb> also colinclark and Bosmon I created a new repo today for my command line tool: https://github.com/simonbates/nexusctl
