b"2017-02-01T20:05:46 <colinclark> had a meeting run over a bit
2017-02-01T20:06:00 <colinclark> I'm all set now\xe2\x80\x94shall we chat on skype?
2017-02-01T20:08:04 <mrtyler> yup
2017-02-01T20:28:27 * Sitesh joined the channel
2017-02-01T20:29:02 * stegru has quit
2017-02-01T20:30:46 <Sitesh> i was giving a deep view to the documentation but there are so many heavy concepts oriented things
2017-02-01T20:31:16 <Sitesh> Can please anybody help me out ? colinclark, Bosmon, Justin_o, alanharnum
2017-02-01T20:31:50 * simonjb joined the channel
2017-02-01T20:34:05 * stegru joined the channel
2017-02-01T20:36:21 <Sitesh> colinclark sir can you help me ?
2017-02-01T21:05:12 <colinclark> Hi Sitesh, I'm not quite sure how I can help you. What is your question?
2017-02-01T21:06:51 <Sitesh> yes sir , Can you please tell me what are the important concepts to be looked upon
2017-02-01T21:07:13 <Sitesh> because the documentation is really concept heavy
2017-02-01T21:07:58 <colinclark> That's a pretty hard question to answer
2017-02-01T21:08:06 <colinclark> it's a bit, well, abstract
2017-02-01T21:08:12 <Sitesh> yes
2017-02-01T21:08:22 <Sitesh> its seems too much in the begginning
2017-02-01T21:09:26 <colinclark> I meant that your question was a bit abstract :)
2017-02-01T21:09:29 <colinclark> but the documentation is too
2017-02-01T21:09:45 <Sitesh> but we have to read it full to start good  contributing
2017-02-01T21:09:55 <Sitesh> right colinclark ?
2017-02-01T21:10:02 <colinclark> well, I don't really know
2017-02-01T21:10:06 <colinclark> that's one way to do it
2017-02-01T21:10:19 <colinclark> but not the only way :)
2017-02-01T21:10:30 <colinclark> One of our community members has been recently working on a developer's introduction to Infusion that may be helpful
2017-02-01T21:10:36 <colinclark> Here is the pull request he submitted for it: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs/pull/114
2017-02-01T21:11:01 <colinclark> You should be able to read it in markdown right in his repository, or you could clone it from Github and build it
2017-02-01T21:11:44 <Sitesh> thanks a lot
2017-02-01T21:11:59 <colinclark> that should give you a much less conceptual overview, Sitesh
2017-02-01T21:12:09 <colinclark> it's not finished yet, but I hear that it has received very good reviews so far
2017-02-01T21:15:31 <Sitesh> yes its very good
2017-02-01T21:15:54 <Sitesh> anyways when i have come this far reading the documentation, i ll give a full glance over it
2017-02-01T21:17:58 <Sitesh> colinclark sir, any other resources as such ?

b'2017-02-01T16:17:58 <gtirloni> alright, that should work for the time being (unless the vbox guest additions start to divert too much. we\'ll keep them on 5.1)
2017-02-01T16:21:33 <amatas> stegru, :(
2017-02-01T16:21:45 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-02-01T16:24:23 <stegru> don\'t worry about me
2017-02-01T16:24:46 <stegru> gloob: was that the gpii installer you were talking about, that\'s 300MB?
2017-02-01T16:25:59 <gloob> stegru: you say this? http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Tha
2017-02-01T16:26:05 <gloob> so are you as cool as gtirloni eh
2017-02-01T16:26:19 <gloob> let me move to my super-duper windows 10 desktop
2017-02-01T16:27:18 <gloob> gtirloni: hahahahahaha, that SLASH SPACE DIR is awesome
2017-02-01T16:27:41 <gtirloni> hehe for a very flexible definition of \'awesome\'
2017-02-01T16:27:54 <gtirloni> similarly to the github incident, i was working at 1am, just giving it \'the final touches\'
2017-02-01T16:28:08 <gtirloni> i guess it was \'too final\'.. if you catch my drift ;)
2017-02-01T16:28:11 <gloob> and freebsd, man you are cool, that remember me my nineteens, when I was cool with my freebsd ports, the master of Makefiles
2017-02-01T16:28:26 <gloob> too final xD
2017-02-01T16:28:53 <gtirloni> yeah, good times
2017-02-01T16:29:23 <gloob> stegru: gpii-app packaged for win32-ia32 with node-packager is exactly 331Mb
2017-02-01T16:30:16 <gloob> gtirloni: yes, I have some horror stories, pretty similar, the delete without where is another classic
2017-02-01T16:30:34 <gloob> normally when you are high of caffeine and sugar at 2 o 3 am
2017-02-01T16:31:30 <alanharnum> talking the gitlab thing?
2017-02-01T16:31:43 <gloob> alanharnum: welcome!
2017-02-01T16:32:01 <alanharnum> i remember when I rm -r\'d my root directory back in 2001.
2017-02-01T16:32:12 <alanharnum> that was a lesson in the power of automation. and slash references.
2017-02-01T16:32:42 <mrtyler> i should point out that modern, enlightened versions of rm don\'t allow you to make that error without --no-preserve-root
2017-02-01T16:33:13 <mrtyler> maybe in like thirty years the BSDs will pick up that feature enhancement
2017-02-01T16:33:18 <alanharnum> this was in the wild days of... i\'m not even sure that was on Linux
2017-02-01T16:33:23 <mrtyler> y\'know, once it\'s "stable enough"
2017-02-01T16:33:32 <alanharnum> it might have been Solaris
2017-02-01T16:33:51 <mrtyler> solaris still doesn\'t ship a non-useless ps
2017-02-01T16:34:35 <mrtyler> alanharnum: btw how is FDS? do we have anything to talk about / do there together?
2017-02-01T16:34:57 <mrtyler> i\'m curious to see our "docker from manifests" strategy and was hoping this would be an easy vector for me to see it
2017-02-01T16:34:57 <stegru> "non-useless"?
2017-02-01T16:35:19 <stegru> heh
2017-02-01T16:35:30 <mrtyler> stegru: sysv ps is the one that uses "-ef" and basically never tells me what i want to know
2017-02-01T16:36:08 <mrtyler> i\'m a auxwwf kind of guy
2017-02-01T16:36:12 <amatas> chmod -R 000 $TMP/* (or something like that, I don\'t remember well)
2017-02-01T16:36:33 <mrtyler> i don\'t think even GNU chmod has a --no-preserve-root
2017-02-01T16:36:43 <amatas> I only remember the pain and the warm of my brain
2017-02-01T16:37:04 <mrtyler> i think even bsd chmod supports +X, so that\'s good
2017-02-01T16:37:21 <mrtyler> otherwise i hope your find-fu is good :)
2017-02-01T16:38:09 <mrtyler> some open source project had the ol\' "rm -rf $UNDEFINED/$ALSO_UNDEFINED" bug a couple years ago
2017-02-01T16:38:14 <mrtyler> there was much shouting on the internet
2017-02-01T16:38:31 <stegru> yeh, that was steam
2017-02-01T16:38:35 <gloob> auxw FTW
2017-02-01T16:38:36 <amatas> yes, it was a good entertainment
2017-02-01T16:38:36 <mrtyler> right
2017-02-01T16:38:51 <amatas> steam installer?
2017-02-01T16:39:13 <stegru> don\'t know
2017-02-01T16:39:19 <mrtyler> i think so

2017-02-01T16:45:56 <mrtyler> oh hey i found the relevant powershell command: Delete-Files-Or-Directories-But-Actually-Just-Copy-Them-Somewhere-Else-Temporarily
2017-02-01T16:46:04 <mrtyler> accepts thirty-six keyword arguments
2017-02-01T16:47:50 <avtar> the-t-in-rtf: alanharnum and i spent some time yesterday with gpii-webdriver and have a question for you
2017-02-01T16:48:17 <the-t-in-rtf> cool
2017-02-01T16:48:30 <avtar> https://github.com/avtar/infusion/blob/testing-gpii-webdriver/tests/demo-tests/axe-example.js#L10-L16
2017-02-01T16:49:40 <avtar> when the real implementation is commented out that function doesn\'t seem to have any effect, in that we want to wait for an animation associated with an overview panel closing to finish before running the axe checks
2017-02-01T16:50:31 <avtar> i\'m hoping you can point out what\'s being overlooked :)
2017-02-01T16:53:21 <the-t-in-rtf> In an ideal world we would finish the IPC bridge so that the node-side webdriver tests could wait for an event on a client-side component
2017-02-01T16:53:38 <the-t-in-rtf> for now, you\'re close to the right approach, which is to wait for a known effect to be observed
2017-02-01T16:53:47 <the-t-in-rtf> Let me find an example of how I\'ve used this pattern in my own work.
2017-02-01T16:55:11 <the-t-in-rtf> https://github.com/the-t-in-rtf/gpii-handlebars/blob/GPII-1810/tests/js/browser/browser-templateFormControl-tests.js#L51
2017-02-01T16:55:30 <the-t-in-rtf> So, basically, you wait for a selector that is evidence of the right state to appear.
2017-02-01T16:55:42 * michelled joined the channel
2017-02-01T16:55:52 <the-t-in-rtf> In the example I shared, I\'m waiting for a success message from a form submission.
2017-02-01T16:56:15 <the-t-in-rtf> rather than (for example) being notified when the event associated with success within the component completes.
2017-02-01T16:57:01 <avtar> the-t-in-rtf: thanks! trying it now
2017-02-01T16:57:21 <the-t-in-rtf> your function might work if you had a polling loop and called the callback after a timeout period or when the item was found
2017-02-01T16:57:30 <the-t-in-rtf> but as it stands I am not surprised it didn\'t work.
2017-02-01T16:57:54 <the-t-in-rtf> in fact I haven\'t ever used a function as the first argument to wait
2017-02-01T16:57:58 <the-t-in-rtf> let me read up on that\xe2\x80\xa6.
2017-02-01T16:58:27 <the-t-in-rtf> oh, neat.
2017-02-01T16:58:33 <the-t-in-rtf> Well, in theory that might work.
2017-02-01T16:58:41 <the-t-in-rtf> but I have not tested that use of wait.
2017-02-01T16:58:53 <the-t-in-rtf> You could put in a ticket for the next time I update that package.
2017-02-01T16:59:09 <the-t-in-rtf> Likely it will get some attention in depth once the drivers for Firefox mature a little more.
2017-02-01T16:59:32 <the-t-in-rtf> I have often used the pattern I sent you, and it has worked at least for me.
2017-02-01T17:00:38 * cindyli joined the channel
2017-02-01T17:00:40 <alanharnum> mrtyler: I need to do some write-ups of what I\'ve found, but short version is that I\'ve got a working Preference Server / Flow Manager container stack locally that can handle authorization (which the actual FDS needs); FDS itself will need some changes to how it communicates with the gpii, but they don\'t seem difficult.
2017-02-01T17:00:46 <the-t-in-rtf> What I was talking about is an approach you could use with executeAsyncScript
2017-02-01T17:00:59 <alanharnum> i\'ve been derailed the last few days by needing to prep some demos and other work, but should be back to it by tomorrow
2017-02-01T17:01:01 <the-t-in-rtf> but go for wait and use the built-in conditions
2017-02-01T17:02:02 <alanharnum> the-t-in-rtf: In theory from reading the webdriver docs, any function that returns a boolean can be supplied; we were able to get some naive versions of this working. The function gets called over and over again until it either returns true, or the timeout is reached.
2017-02-01T17:04:54 <mrtyler> alanharnum: sounds good. i should be around tmrw so ping me if you get back to it
2017-02-01T17:05:13 <alanharnum> mrtyler: will do

2017-02-01T17:31:51 <Bosmon> Do you have the same one?
2017-02-01T17:32:27 <Bosmon> I can\'t reproduce it after an rm -rf node_modules and npm install

2017-02-01T17:33:06 <kasparnet> yes, that\'s it
2017-02-01T17:33:10 <kasparnet> and it\'s failing consistently
2017-02-01T17:33:28 <kasparnet> My main suspect is the version of linux
2017-02-01T17:33:31 <Bosmon> !!!!!
2017-02-01T17:33:34 <Bosmon> Seems pretty bizarre
2017-02-01T17:33:55 <Bosmon> I guess we have some kind of arch-dependent build failure for infusion?
2017-02-01T17:52:31 <kasparnet> I\'m using the version 1.0.0 of the idrc linux box
2017-02-01T18:03:55 <kasparnet> Bosmon: added info to the pull you linked
2017-02-01T18:04:02 <kasparnet> gotta go eat now
2017-02-01T18:07:07 <jhernandez> I\'m provisioning from scratch and will check if I can reproduce it
2017-02-01T18:08:21 <jhernandez> I can also run them in my laptop - did I need to do anything special in my browser in order to run them?

2017-02-01T18:37:41 <jhernandez> FYI, same problem here in my freshly created box (using the last version of inclusivedesign/f24)
2017-02-01T18:52:57 <Bosmon> Hey there simonjb - sorry to keep pushing things your way but I believe you are the most qualified person :)
2017-02-01T18:53:08 <Bosmon> I wonder if you could take a look at this little Kettle fix at some point: https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/pull/30
2017-02-01T18:54:08 <Bosmon> For new diffs I\'ve been adhering to our newly agreed line length :)
2017-02-01T18:54:16 <simonjb> np Bosmon I will take a look
2017-02-01T18:54:21 <simonjb> :)
2017-02-01T18:54:52 <Bosmon> simonjb - awesome :)
2017-02-01T18:55:13 <Bosmon> This is actually a particularly insufferable issue caused by Kettle\'s architecture that I really can\'t think of a good answer to
2017-02-01T18:55:21 <Bosmon> Other than abandoning the "request marking" architecture completely
2017-02-01T18:55:31 <Bosmon> But I do believe that, when it works, it can be a source of very useful diagnostics
2017-02-01T18:56:06 <Bosmon> I think I\'ve convinced myself that there are intervals of time where code may execute on behalf of a particular HTTP request (and hence Kettle component) where the IoC system as a whole doesn\'t have enough context to work out which request that is
2017-02-01T18:56:23 * michelled joined the channel
2017-02-01T18:56:26 <Bosmon> And therefore when errors occur during this time interval, they can be hard to attribute
2017-02-01T18:56:54 <Bosmon> But the more I work with it, the more I feel that the current architecture for doing this is sort of untenable, especially faced with middleware that looks like the following:
2017-02-01T18:57:05 * cindyli joined the channel
2017-02-01T18:57:17 <Bosmon> https://github.com/expressjs/serve-static/blob/master/index.js#L72
2017-02-01T18:57:39 <Bosmon> The whole point of serve-static is that "in the interests of efficiency", it reserves the right to do I/O at any time it pleases
2017-02-01T18:57:50 <Bosmon> Deep in the guts of the implementation of "pipe", where we could never hope to instrument it
2017-02-01T18:58:18 <Bosmon> But based on what it is and who wrote it, one would imagine that one could trust them never to generate bare errors that are not surfaced in the "err" callback to the middleware, but who knows
2017-02-01T19:00:25 <Bosmon> The alternative might be to use an approach similar to that in something like https://github.com/mattinsler/longjohn but i) I\'m not sure what the approach actually is, ii) what the intrusiveness and performance implications of it are
2017-02-01T19:00:39 <Bosmon> By eye it looks pretty revolting in that it pollutes the global prototype of EventEmitter
2017-02-01T19:01:54 <Bosmon> So my current tendency is to try to soldier on patching up our current approach of "instrumenting the callbacks we can reach, minimising the ones we can\'t, and resigning ourselves to ignoring the others"

2017-02-01T13:46:10 <gloob> because the incident is serious
2017-02-01T13:46:20 <gloob> big downtime, probably a loss of data
2017-02-01T13:46:30 <gloob> gtirloni: we are discussing the gitlab incident

2017-02-01T13:59:19 <kasparnet> ping Bosmon
2017-02-01T13:59:30 <Bosmon> Hey kaspardnite
2017-02-01T13:59:50 <kasparnet> quick question re: the MM change
2017-02-01T14:01:44 <kasparnet> I\'m getting more and more convinced that the "isRunning" aka. "get" portion of the lifecycle-settings should live at top level instead of within a settingshandler block
2017-02-01T14:01:52 <kasparnet> which may sound a bit weird
2017-02-01T14:02:21 <Bosmon> gloob: "Regular backups seem to also only be taken once per 24 hours, though team-member-1 has not yet been able to figure out where they are stored. " - fun
2017-02-01T14:02:44 <Bosmon> kasparnet - ok
2017-02-01T14:02:47 <Bosmon> What is your thinking?
2017-02-01T14:03:26 <Bosmon> "So in other words, out of 5 backup/replication techniques deployed none are working reliably or set up in the first place. We ended up restoring a 6 hours old backup."
2017-02-01T14:06:01 <kasparnet> goddammit... Trying to figure out how to explain makes me realize I\'m might be disagreeing with myself
2017-02-01T14:06:04 <kasparnet> ... give me 5\'
2017-02-01T14:06:05 <kasparnet> :D
2017-02-01T14:11:16 <gloob> well, Bosmon what is cold in your back is this
2017-02-01T14:11:46 <gloob> At 2017/01/31 23:00-ish team-member-1 thinks that perhaps pg_basebackup is refusing to work due to the PostgreSQL data directory being present (despite being empty), decides to remove the directory. After a second or two he notices he ran it on db1.cluster.gitlab.com, instead of db2.cluster.gitlab.com.
2017-02-01T14:11:51 <gloob> At 2017/01/31 23:27 team-member-1 - terminates the removal, but it\xe2\x80\x99s too late. Of around 300 GB only about 4.5 GB is left
2017-02-01T14:11:58 <stegru> making backups is all very well, but it\'s the ability to recover from them that\'s important
2017-02-01T14:12:18 <gloob> what usually doesn\'t works xD
2017-02-01T14:12:42 <gloob> so you make a rm -rf prod.db
2017-02-01T14:12:46 <gloob> pour a coffee
2017-02-01T14:13:13 <gloob> and see in the prompt, db1 THE PRODUCTION MACHINE ONE YOU SHOULDNT TOUCH.cluster.gitlab.com
2017-02-01T14:13:22 <gloob> wow, what a sensation
2017-02-01T14:13:54 <stegru> yeh, if just the \'1\' and the \'2\' are the only things that differentiate them, then no wonder
2017-02-01T14:14:28 <gloob> I visualize the zoomin of that eyes into the db1 pixels
2017-02-01T14:14:52 <gloob> is that a one?
2017-02-01T14:14:55 <gloob> IS THAT A ONE?
2017-02-01T14:15:01 <kasparnet> haha
2017-02-01T14:15:19 <stegru> yeh but, not everyone is as good as you
2017-02-01T14:15:32 <gloob> nono, I had the same situation one time
2017-02-01T14:15:38 <gloob> I understand it perfectly
2017-02-01T14:16:17 <gloob> I stay all the night playing with several ext3 recover tools in a cold CPD
2017-02-01T14:22:13 <gloob> or like the classical script with rm -rf /$VAR
2017-02-01T14:23:45 <stegru> yeh i remember steam had that one
2017-02-01T14:23:58 <stegru> vagrant
2017-02-01T14:24:06 <stegru> shit, now everyone knows my vm password
2017-02-01T14:24:27 <amatas> I get chills every time I read that part of Gitlab ops\' log
2017-02-01T14:26:54 * colinclark joined the channel
2017-02-01T14:28:47 <gloob> stegru: you are hacked now
2017-02-01T14:29:35 <stegru> the chance would be a fine thing.. it keeps crashing
2017-02-01T14:29:44 <kasparnet> stegru: lol
2017-02-01T14:29:49 <gloob> let the hacker fix it!
2017-02-01T14:30:35 <stegru> i think vmware 5.1.x is still broke, for me
2017-02-01T14:30:41 <stegru> virtualbox, i mean
2017-02-01T14:32:02 <gloob> with the new box?
2017-02-01T14:32:11 <gloob> I didn\'t update
2017-02-01T14:32:26 <gloob> but amatas said it was safe to do it
2017-02-01T14:32:38 <stegru> and like a fool i believed him
2017-02-01T14:32:41 <gloob> I mean, I didn\'t update the vbox version
2017-02-01T14:32:44 <gloob> haha
2017-02-01T14:32:54 <gloob> stegru have a good day
2017-02-01T14:33:02 <stegru> to be honest, i\'ve been using 5.1.x for a couple of weeks, and it was ok - only broke a few times
2017-02-01T14:33:16 * avtar joined the channel
2017-02-01T14:33:35 <gloob> stegru: which kind of breakage
2017-02-01T14:33:43 <gloob> stegru: linux host?
2017-02-01T14:33:48 <stegru> yes
2017-02-01T14:33:49 <gloob> stegru: ok, time for updating
2017-02-01T14:34:02 <amatas> stegru, what kind of problems do you have with virtualbox?
2017-02-01T14:34:55 <stegru> it just doesn\'t work, amatas - windows crashes when it does something hard
2017-02-01T14:35:45 <stegru> at random times
2017-02-01T14:36:12 <amatas> do you have some kind of steps to reproduce those crashes?
2017-02-01T14:36:37 <stegru> yes, 1. start windows 2. wait
2017-02-01T14:36:43 <gloob> hhahahahahaha
2017-02-01T14:37:12 <gloob> stegru: best issue report, ever
2017-02-01T14:37:34 <amatas> :D
2017-02-01T14:38:15 <stegru> last week i set up a new windows 10 (not the vagrant box), installed visual studio, and it didn\'t crash
2017-02-01T14:38:33 <amatas> the crash is in the OS (bluescreen) or just the VM freezes?
2017-02-01T14:38:42 <stegru> i\'ve rolled back to vb 5.0.
2017-02-01T14:39:19 <stegru> yeh bluescreen.. it just says something like "SERVICE_ERROR" or whatever it is. the event log says nothing useful apart from telling me it wasn\'t shut down properly
2017-02-01T14:39:49 <stegru> vb log just says it\'s not had the heartbeat for 4 seconds
2017-02-01T14:40:33 <stegru> i read somewhere that setting the paravirtualisation setting to "none" fixes it - it almost did
2017-02-01T14:40:48 <stegru> (took longer to fail)
2017-02-01T14:43:16 <amatas> which setup do you have in your host?
2017-02-01T14:44:20 <amatas> I mean, which processor and memory amount
2017-02-01T14:45:27 <stegru> 2x quad zeons, 32gb
2017-02-01T14:46:11 <amatas> lucky guy
2017-02-01T14:46:11 <stegru> i allocated more cores and memory to the vm to see if that did anything
2017-02-01T14:46:57 <stegru> it\'s an old server/workstation from ebay... the parts are cheap
2017-02-01T14:47:59 <stegru> vb 5.0.32 is working so far now
2017-02-01T14:50:14 <stegru> yes it\'s provisioning - I think it\'s fixed
2017-02-01T14:52:21 * clown joined the channel
2017-02-01T14:52:54 <amatas> perhaps going over the virtualization options of the BIOS you can identify what causes the crash
2017-02-01T14:53:53 <stegru> the host?
2017-02-01T14:54:38 <amatas> yes
2017-02-01T14:54:39 <stegru> oh, i didn\'t reboot the host - i wonder if that could do anything
2017-02-01T14:55:01 <amatas> mm, when you update vbox new kernel modules must be reloaded
2017-02-01T14:55:30 <amatas> I mean, if you run a vbox version application using old kernel modules something could go wrong
2017-02-01T14:55:58 <stegru> yes, i\'m going to try that later
2017-02-01T14:56:24 <stegru> i hope that doesn\'t fix it, because then it would be my own fault
2017-02-01T14:57:05 <amatas> haha

2017-02-01T15:56:25 <gtirloni> the gitlab incident is very unfortunate :(
2017-02-01T15:57:02 <gtirloni> we have not conducted large scale backup restoration days here
2017-02-01T15:57:25 <gtirloni> but i have used our backups to cherry pick files and troubleshoot, quite often
2017-02-01T15:57:26 * kasparnet joined the channel
2017-02-01T16:03:36 <gtirloni> in 2002, i ran `rm -rf / somedir` on a freebsd host, hours before it had to be delivered to the client
2017-02-01T16:04:09 <kasparnet> Bosmon: sure.. upping a new VM and running tests, will push then
2017-02-01T16:04:35 <gtirloni> in 2016, i ran a \'delete from user_table` without a where clause, it emptied the table used to hold credentials for all sprint nextel store managers (luckily, 5min replication to a standby database helped to restore everything)
2017-02-01T16:04:41 <gtirloni> gloob: do you have a horror story? :)
2017-02-01T16:04:47 <gtirloni> s/2016/2016/
2017-02-01T16:04:51 <gtirloni> ugh, 2006!
2017-02-01T16:11:11 <mrtyler> gtirloni: i have a similar story: http://imgur.com/a/5vw0V
2017-02-01T16:12:26 <gtirloni> haha that\'s what i call a "preferred first name"
2017-02-01T16:13:10 <stegru> amatas: fyi, the host reboot didn\'t fix vbox 5.1.x - i\'m back on 5.0.x and i\'m going to continue with my life
2017-02-01T16:13:32 <mrtyler> the reason manual intevention was needed, btw, was because reviewboard lost its mind when a new user was created named Mich\xc3\xa9le
2017-02-01T16:15:00 <gtirloni> stegru: are you experiencing these issues in vbox 5.1 with VMs that you cloned? or VMs that you installed from scratch?
2017-02-01T16:15:11 <gtirloni> mrtyler: utf-8 issues?
2017-02-01T16:15:21 <mrtyler> gtirloni: exactly
2017-02-01T16:15:38 <mrtyler> well and bad error handling code, i guess
2017-02-01T16:16:28 <stegru> our vagrant box (sometimes other win10 I installed from iso) - it doesn\'t matter now, I\'m keeping with 5.0
