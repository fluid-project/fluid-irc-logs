2017-01-18T21:08:50 <mrtyler> alanharnum: i\'m going to reply in the thread but if you\'re going to move that service sometime i\'d like to tag along while you do
2017-01-18T21:09:15 <mrtyler> no rush tho. tl;dr: my experiments are very unlikely to affect you
2017-01-18T21:11:23 <alanharnum> mrtyler: I was going to do it tomorrow, since they should have been moved to a production host a while ago anyway
2017-01-18T21:11:49 <mrtyler> alanharnum: that\'s cool. can we schedule a time?
2017-01-18T21:12:05 <alanharnum> sure - tomorrow is pretty clear. what\'s good for you?
2017-01-18T21:12:12 <alanharnum> i\'m usually around by 10:00 EST
2017-01-18T21:12:53 <mrtyler> i could do 1000 est. 1100 est would be a little easier
2017-01-18T21:13:38 <mrtyler> or like 1030
2017-01-18T21:13:53 <alanharnum> let\'s say 10:30, our standup is 11:30
2017-01-18T21:14:03 <alanharnum> you\'ll get to watch me try and remember how various things work!
2017-01-18T21:14:07 <mrtyler> ok great. you want a calendar event?
2017-01-18T21:14:11 <alanharnum> sure
2017-01-18T21:14:13 <mrtyler> ok
2017-01-18T21:14:19 <mrtyler> and yeah, i\'ll help if i can
2017-01-18T21:14:32 <mrtyler> tho i\'ll confess i\'m sort of interested in seeing how you reason about the infrastructure :)
2017-01-18T21:14:58 <alanharnum> all the container launching and orchestration is in an Ansible playbook, so that\'s unlikely to be an issue
2017-01-18T21:15:14 <alanharnum> the bigger one will be remembering how the heck Route53 works, since i think it\'s been about a year since i touched it
2017-01-18T21:16:22 <mrtyler> i\'m sure it will have a web interface with a totally non-overwhelming amount of information

2017-01-18T21:18:40 <alanharnum> ah good my usual response to doing ops stuff
2017-01-18T21:19:12 <alanharnum> "I WILL NEVER REMEMBER HOW TO DO THIS I AM TERRIBLE" > "oh, right, I remember how this works, may need to reread some documentation", elapsed time < 10 minutes
2017-01-18T21:21:50 <alanharnum> thinking about it this might actually be an ideal service to explore migrating to cloud infrastructure as well, as it\'s a pretty self-contained GPII demo
2017-01-18T21:22:44 <mrtyler> that sounds like a good thing to talk about!
2017-01-18T21:25:08 <alanharnum> mrtyler: some details about the service in question if you haven\'t seen them: https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/First+Discovery+Server+Demo

2017-01-18T21:40:17 <mrtyler> :)
2017-01-18T21:41:06 <mrtyler> calendaring is another problem i really thought the human race would have nailed by two thousand and sixteen
2017-01-18T21:41:11 <mrtyler> seventeen*
2017-01-18T21:41:21 <mrtyler> i guess this could be the year
2017-01-18T21:41:30 <alanharnum> i think you just proved your own point by forgetting the current year ;)
2017-01-18T21:41:42 <alanharnum> calendars and timekeeping are fiendish
2017-01-18T21:41:49 <mrtyler> haha
2017-01-18T21:42:29 <alanharnum> it\'s a problem that in some ways is as hard and unpredictable and edge-casey as NLP, but has a lot of software libraries that make it appear straightforward and formal
2017-01-18T21:42:45 <mrtyler> i had a meeting last year with a fellow in Scotland during the week when Europe had already exited daylight savings time but the US hadn\'t
2017-01-18T21:42:52 <alanharnum> leap years! leap seconds! timezones! DST!
2017-01-18T21:43:22 <mrtyler> yes, and therefore encourages people to think "oh i don\'t need a library for this. i\'ll just..."
2017-01-18T21:43:34 <mrtyler> not that i have ever done that
2017-01-18T21:43:37 <alanharnum> yup, the mismatched DST gets us a lot here too
2017-01-18T21:44:12 <mrtyler> let\'s see if alanharnum knows this xkcd by url alone: https://xkcd.com/927/
2017-01-18T21:44:24 <alanharnum> hahaha
2017-01-18T21:44:48 <alanharnum> i know that from both my developer identity and my former librarian identity
2017-01-18T21:45:15 <mrtyler> the classics are always universal
2017-01-18T21:45:30 <alanharnum> my most cited: https://xkcd.com/386/
2017-01-18T21:45:49 <mrtyler> indeed
2017-01-18T21:45:59 <alanharnum> and https://xkcd.com/327/
2017-01-18T21:46:55 <mrtyler> a comic so good it recon\'d its way into a metaphor for a specific class of database vulnerability
2017-01-18T21:47:51 <michelled> oh alanharnum - I love that last one - my last name once closed a sql statement

2017-01-18T14:18:01 <Bosmon> HI kasparnet
2017-01-18T14:19:04 <kasparnet> Bosmon: I\'m trying to wrap up the vagrant/provisioning scripts for gpii-app
2017-01-18T14:19:13 <kasparnet> but have an issue when running the tests
2017-01-18T14:19:14 <Bosmon> Wrap it....... UPP!
2017-01-18T14:19:20 <kasparnet> hahah, indeed
2017-01-18T14:19:56 <kasparnet> currently the tests are done with a bunch of require statements, referencing the windows tests
2017-01-18T14:20:10 <kasparnet> but it seems they run ascynchronously
2017-01-18T14:21:40 <kasparnet> that is - having: require("blabla"); console.log("Done");
2017-01-18T14:21:52 <kasparnet> would print out Done before the tests are done running
2017-01-18T14:22:26 <kasparnet> afaik require is synchronous and I thought the test infrastructure was as well
2017-01-18T14:22:40 <kasparnet> ... does ^ make any sense to you, Bosmon?
2017-01-18T14:23:33 <Bosmon> kasparnet - perfect sense
2017-01-18T14:23:42 <Bosmon> You are reckoning without the insanity of the QUnit testing framework
2017-01-18T14:24:10 <Bosmon> And - what is the problem you\'re having in this area - that is, why might you not want the tests to run asynchronously?
2017-01-18T14:28:50 <kasparnet> Bosmon: mostly to be able to shut down the node/electron process afterwards
2017-01-18T14:28:56 <kasparnet> right now it just keeps running
2017-01-18T14:30:29 <Bosmon> ok
2017-01-18T14:33:43 <gloob> kasparnet: where are you commiting that?

2017-01-18T15:47:06 <gtirloni> mrtyler: yes, i\'m available
2017-01-18T15:47:20 <mrtyler> hooray
2017-01-18T15:47:41 <mrtyler> i think i found a bug in the openvpn setup ;)
2017-01-18T15:49:17 <gtirloni> wow, what\'s it
2017-01-18T15:49:25 <mrtyler> 244 != 224
2017-01-18T15:50:11 <mrtyler> openvpn interface uses the former, pfsense and some ansible rules use the latter
2017-01-18T15:52:26 <gtirloni> ah interesting, so checking ansible\'s group_vars/all and tor1_bkp firewall rules should fix it
2017-01-18T15:52:31 <gtirloni> s/checking/changing
2017-01-18T15:53:29 <mrtyler> yeah i\'d like to do that today with your guidance
2017-01-18T15:53:42 <gtirloni> sure
2017-01-18T15:53:52 <gtirloni> how did you find it? connection refused errors?
2017-01-18T15:54:02 <mrtyler> basically
2017-01-18T15:54:19 <mrtyler> testing openvpn before i added my home ip to the "allow everything" rule
2017-01-18T15:54:43 <gtirloni> ok
2017-01-18T15:54:51 <gtirloni> good catch!

2017-01-18T16:12:53 <Bosmon> I wonder what happens to the process.exit call triggered on this line:
2017-01-18T16:13:00 <Bosmon> https://github.com/fluid-project/node-jqunit/blob/master/lib/jqUnit-node.js#L195
2017-01-18T16:13:08 <Bosmon> Is this just a no-op on electron?
2017-01-18T16:13:15 <Bosmon> Or are we not loading node-jqUnit at all?
2017-01-18T16:14:22 <Bosmon> This pull claims that process.exit has been fixed on electron: https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/1983
2017-01-18T16:14:33 <Bosmon> So I wonder what state we are at
2017-01-18T16:18:03 <kasparnet> Bosmon: hmmm.. not sure - I\'ll do a bit of debugging
