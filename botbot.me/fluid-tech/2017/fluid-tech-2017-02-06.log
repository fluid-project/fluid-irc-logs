2017-02-06T17:01:06 <gtirloni> mrtyler alanharnum: what\'s this molecule thing you were talking about? the name is familiar, i think you mentioned it here before.. do you have a url?
2017-02-06T17:01:20 <alanharnum> gtirloni: https://github.com/metacloud/molecule
2017-02-06T17:01:41 <alanharnum> I haven\'t tried it myself, but it\'s designed to aid development and testing of Ansible roles
2017-02-06T17:02:00 <gtirloni> ah cool, i\'ll check that later. thanks!
2017-02-06T17:02:09 <gtirloni> it got me confused with \'nulecule\': http://www.projectatomic.io/docs/nulecule/
2017-02-06T17:02:46 <gtirloni> i think this is what openshift uses (is aspiring to use)

2017-02-06T17:34:57 <gtirloni> amatas: the docker 1.12 upgrade causes running containers to get stopped.. which would be fine if they could be started again. so it depends on which version of docker they were created (pre- or post-runC adoption), they can\'t be started any longer and need to be created from scratch.
2017-02-06T17:35:30 <gtirloni> amatas: i don\'t know how much of a problem that will be for i-0026.. but i\'m thinking we can expect to have to create them from scratch
2017-02-06T17:36:12 <gtirloni> if the container was create pre-runC adoption, `docker start` worked, on my tests.
2017-02-06T17:37:04 <gtirloni> ah, and fetching new images was also broken :(
2017-02-06T17:37:49 <gtirloni> i had to delete all images (`docker rmi $(docker images -q -a)`).. or it wouldn\'t fetch new ones
2017-02-06T17:43:03 <mrtyler> gtirloni: i\'m done with meetings for the day (tho i will break for lunch at some point) so we can chat whenever you are free
2017-02-06T17:43:38 <gtirloni> mrtyler: cool! after your lunch, please ping me
2017-02-06T17:44:00 <mrtyler> ok
2017-02-06T17:46:17 <amatas> gtirloni, right about the docker update
2017-02-06T17:46:42 <amatas> in my small server case, I had to remove all the containers and all the images and download/build again
2017-02-06T17:46:55 <amatas> I\'m using an updated centos in that server
2017-02-06T17:47:27 <amatas> so I guess that the transition from docker 1.10 to 1.12 involves the clean and build again all the containers
2017-02-06T17:48:07 <mrtyler> something something immutable architecture ;)
2017-02-06T17:48:25 <amatas> all the containers in i-0026 are built using ansible. BUT I had to test them first because I have seen some caveats with every ansible/docker update
2017-02-06T17:50:53 <amatas> yes mrtyler, I remember that magic sentence "Build once deploy everywhere"
2017-02-06T17:51:16 <gtirloni> from what i can tell, it\'s the first version where they have "containerd" as the supervisor process, i think that explains most of these issues
2017-02-06T17:52:43 <gtirloni> 1.12 was the big version they announced during dockercon, with all bells and whistles.. it has Swarm built-in so I\'m guessing the changes are extensive
2017-02-06T17:54:07 <gtirloni> i don\'t know if you noticed but the process is named "dockerd-current" ... red hat created a ingenious way of updating docker in the future, where rollbacks wouldn\'t be so destructive
2017-02-06T17:55:03 <amatas> oh, those are good news
2017-02-06T17:55:39 <gtirloni> our issue (one of them, at least): https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2876431
2017-02-06T17:56:30 <gtirloni> that might allow some containers to start :)
2017-02-06T17:56:36 <gtirloni> ln -s /usr/libexec/docker/docker-runc-current /usr/libexec/docker/docker-runc
2017-02-06T17:57:19 <mrtyler> SUBSCRIBER EXCLUSIVE CONTENT
2017-02-06T17:57:39 <mrtyler> iow i can\'t read the whole thing
2017-02-06T17:57:40 <amatas> :D ok, anyway I think that the rebuild of the containers is not a big issue.
2017-02-06T17:57:45 <mrtyler> fyi
2017-02-06T17:59:16 <gtirloni> my memory is fuzzy about this but i think the red hat developer subscription is now free
2017-02-06T17:59:22 <gtirloni> you may have to register at https://developers.redhat.com
