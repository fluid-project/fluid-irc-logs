2017-03-28T17:09:21 <mrtyler> amatas: gtirloni i\'m investigating the ansible CI failures. did either of you do anything to h-0005?
2017-03-28T17:09:29 <mrtyler> the failure looks like this: https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/23016
2017-03-28T17:09:38 <mrtyler> but ansible is 2.2.1.0 on that machine still
2017-03-28T17:10:10 <amatas> nothing related to ansible from my side
2017-03-28T17:10:38 <mrtyler> hmm well ansible is installed from yum now, which is wrong
2017-03-28T17:10:54 <amatas> I killed a couple of vms that were locked building vagrant boxes
2017-03-28T17:11:04 <gtirloni> thanks mrtyler. last change i did to h-0005 was on march 16 for the vbox 5.1.18 upgrade, IIRC.
2017-03-28T17:11:15 <mrtyler> i guess i\'ll re-run my ansible-ansible playbook and see what happens
2017-03-28T17:11:42 <amatas> in fact I don\'t remember which use of ansible we make in h-0005
2017-03-28T17:11:42 <gtirloni> log of installed yum packages can be found in /var/log/yum.log
2017-03-28T17:12:07 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-03-28T17:12:07 <mrtyler> Feb 11 19:45:47 Updated: ansible-2.2.1.0-1.el7.noarch
2017-03-28T17:12:13 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-03-28T17:12:15 <mrtyler> so that should not be relevant
2017-03-28T17:12:34 <mrtyler> oh wait i know why
2017-03-28T17:12:52 <mrtyler> 1. i\'m getting h5 mixed up with i40
2017-03-28T17:13:27 <mrtyler> 2. the ansible ci projects get ansible from pip. i left it unpinned so it\'s pulling the new version that is broken according to that github issue
2017-03-28T17:13:50 <mrtyler> so everything will be fine once upstream ansible isn\'t broken, i hope :)
2017-03-28T17:14:12 <amatas> anyway good to know that issue
2017-03-28T17:14:31 <mrtyler> i guess. it\'s a pretty dumb issue :), if the analysis is right
2017-03-28T17:14:52 <mrtyler> "It looks like when 36b462b was cherry-picked but not c4cff44 which actually adds the remove_group to the Host object.
2017-03-28T17:14:55 <mrtyler> "
2017-03-28T17:15:35 <mrtyler> anyway i guess i\'ll ignore this for now. an alternative is to pin ansible to 2.2.1.0 in the various roles that get CI treatment
2017-03-28T17:15:41 <mrtyler> i\'m happy to do that if you guys think it\'s useful
2017-03-28T17:16:05 <gtirloni> is there anything applying the ansible-ansible role on these machines? i wonder what changed from mar 26 to mar 27
2017-03-28T17:16:25 <mrtyler> no, and i think what changed is that ansible 2.2 was released
2017-03-28T17:17:03 <gtirloni> oh ok, got it
2017-03-28T17:17:46 <mrtyler> i only manage ansible in i40
2017-03-28T17:17:52 <mrtyler> with config_host_ansible
2017-03-28T17:18:02 <mrtyler> but i thought i was doing it on h5 because i got confused
