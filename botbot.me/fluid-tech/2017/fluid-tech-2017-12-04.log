2017-12-04T17:05:07 <simonjb> hi colinclark, gtirloni__ and I just chatted about Nexus packaging and our current thoughts are to make a Nexus Docker image that could be used with Docker natively on Linux and on Docker for Windows and Docker for Mac
2017-12-04T17:05:21 <colinclark> oh great
2017-12-04T17:05:25 <colinclark> that sounds just fine
2017-12-04T17:05:41 <simonjb> in addition, we would make a simple Vagranfile that runs the Docker image under a minimal Linux VM
2017-12-04T17:05:50 <colinclark> cool
2017-12-04T17:06:04 <simonjb> that could be used without installing Docker for Windows or Docker for MAc
2017-12-04T17:06:10 <colinclark> right
2017-12-04T17:06:17 <colinclark> for those with ancient operating systems ;)
2017-12-04T17:06:18 <simonjb> (if you already had Vagrant set up)
2017-12-04T17:06:29 <simonjb> does that would for you?
2017-12-04T17:06:33 <colinclark> sure
2017-12-04T17:06:34 <colinclark> sounds just fine
2017-12-04T17:07:16 <simonjb> and I'm thinking to make a new repo nexus-dist that collects the pieces from nexus, co-occurrence engine, and fluid-authoring (Visible Nexus)
2017-12-04T17:07:54 <simonjb> colinclark: does that seem reasonable?
2017-12-04T17:08:07 <simonjb> the new 'distribution' repo
2017-12-04T17:08:15 <colinclark> yes
2017-12-04T17:08:17 <colinclark> that would be nice
2017-12-04T17:08:26 <simonjb> ok, awesome
2017-12-04T17:08:30 <simonjb> thanks colinclark
2017-12-04T17:08:46 <simonjb> gtirloni__ ^ looks like we are good to go
2017-12-04T17:10:37 <gtirloni__> cool, thank you! i'll get started on it today
2017-12-04T17:10:41 * gtirloni__ is now known as gtirloni
2017-12-04T17:11:04 <simonjb> thanks gtirloni !
