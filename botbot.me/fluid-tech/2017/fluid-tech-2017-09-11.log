b'2017-09-11T20:23:58 <gtirloni> mrtyler: before i start breaking things, could you help me understand this error? https://www.pastery.net/nyhbma+acaajk/#nyhbma
2017-09-11T20:24:17 <mrtyler> looking
2017-09-11T20:24:44 <mrtyler> do you have the right aws creds?
2017-09-11T20:25:47 <gtirloni> i\'ve added them with `aws configure --profile gpii` and then defined $AWS_PROFILE=gpii .. should they live somewhere else?
2017-09-11T20:26:18 <gtirloni> `aws sts get-caller-identity` returns the correct user ID
2017-09-11T20:26:36 <mrtyler> that sounds good
2017-09-11T20:26:57 <mrtyler> aws s3 ls --region us-east-2 s3://gpii-terraform-state
2017-09-11T20:27:03 <mrtyler> try that plz
2017-09-11T20:27:14 <mrtyler> it should return some stuff
2017-09-11T20:27:25 <gtirloni> https://www.pastery.net/nyhbma+acaajk+pkebef/#pkebef
2017-09-11T20:27:51 <mrtyler> hmm
2017-09-11T20:28:14 <mrtyler> are you somehow running rake in an environment where AWS_PROFILE isn\'t set?
2017-09-11T20:28:48 <mrtyler> i don\'t use AWS_PROFILE so that\'s a potential difference between your environment and mine (and alfredo\'s, who also doesn\'t have this problem)
2017-09-11T20:28:55 <gtirloni> it\'s set.. just retried
2017-09-11T20:29:03 <gtirloni> ok, I can use the AWS_ env vars and see how it goes
2017-09-11T20:29:13 <mrtyler> i don\'t do that either :)
2017-09-11T20:29:23 <mrtyler> i just have the default .aws/config with my creds
2017-09-11T20:29:54 <mrtyler> i wonder if terraform doesn\'t respect AWS_PROFILE for some reason
2017-09-11T20:30:01 <gtirloni> I have 3 profiles that I need to switch between, so it\'s a bit painful to change the default one all the time
2017-09-11T20:30:44 <mrtyler> right that\'s fine, i\'m just saying it\'s a potential difference
2017-09-11T20:30:51 <mrtyler> it\'s definitely a feature the system should support :)
2017-09-11T20:31:10 <mrtyler> let me see if i can repro
2017-09-11T20:31:41 <gtirloni> ok, looks like using AWS_ACCESS_KEY got me further but I\'m getting this now: https://www.pastery.net/nyhbma+acaajk+pkebef+rxxyuv/#rxxyuv  (i have waited and retried, not sure if it\'s really a delay)
2017-09-11T20:32:41 <gtirloni> btw, we can troubleshoot this at another time.. no hurry
2017-09-11T20:32:56 <mrtyler> wow i have not seen that error before
2017-09-11T20:32:59 <mrtyler> so congratulations
2017-09-11T20:33:00 <mrtyler> !
2017-09-11T20:33:07 <gtirloni> haha
2017-09-11T20:33:17 <gtirloni> i\'m on terraform 0.9.11 this time, i hope that\'s the one
2017-09-11T20:33:30 <mrtyler> yup :)
2017-09-11T20:34:19 <gtirloni> maybe deleting ~/.terraform.d will help
2017-09-11T20:34:19 <mrtyler> ok, first let me make sure spinning up a cluster works for me
2017-09-11T20:34:22 <gtirloni> ok
2017-09-11T20:34:43 <mrtyler> yeah, you can nuke any local terraform state
2017-09-11T20:34:46 <mrtyler> pretty much at any time
2017-09-11T20:34:59 <mrtyler> also you should rake clean ; rake clobber
2017-09-11T20:35:07 <mrtyler> that was causing alfredom some trouble earlier
2017-09-11T20:35:19 <gtirloni> ok, done all 3.. want me to try agian?
2017-09-11T20:35:19 <mrtyler> some things get persisted to TMPDIR for various reasons
2017-09-11T20:35:22 <mrtyler> sure
2017-09-11T20:35:25 <gtirloni> ok, one sec
2017-09-11T20:35:37 <mrtyler> my cluster has progressed beyond you
2017-09-11T20:35:49 <mrtyler> so that s3 sync issue seems bogus
2017-09-11T20:36:21 <gtirloni> that didn\'t help, same error here
2017-09-11T20:36:35 <mrtyler> the s3 sync one?
2017-09-11T20:37:01 <gtirloni> yep
2017-09-11T20:37:07 <gtirloni> rror loading state: state data in S3 does not have the expected content.
2017-09-11T20:37:32 <mrtyler> let me take a quick peek at your s3 state
2017-09-11T20:37:42 <mrtyler> and then i\'ll nuke your key
2017-09-11T20:38:32 <mrtyler> you don\'t have a key
2017-09-11T20:38:37 <mrtyler> there\'s no dev-gtirloni in the bucket
2017-09-11T20:39:04 <gtirloni> yeah, i noticed that dynamo has 2 locks for me, and none of them have the same ID that terraform is complaining about
2017-09-11T20:39:20 <gtirloni> i remember since "the incident" i didn\'t create any other clusters
2017-09-11T20:39:26 <mrtyler> haha
2017-09-11T20:39:33 <mrtyler> you do have a key in prereqs/
2017-09-11T20:39:48 <mrtyler> which is where rake is when it\'s failing
2017-09-11T20:39:54 <mrtyler> maybe this is the one that needs to die
2017-09-11T20:40:21 <mrtyler> \\
2017-09-11T20:40:24 <mrtyler> ok i deleted it
2017-09-11T20:40:26 <mrtyler> plz try again
2017-09-11T20:40:44 * cindyli has quit
2017-09-11T20:42:06 <gtirloni> same error but now it doesn\'t show a lock ID... ugh
2017-09-11T20:42:10 <mrtyler> :(
2017-09-11T20:42:12 <gtirloni> ok, i\'ll have to continue this tomorrow
2017-09-11T20:42:16 <gtirloni> thanks for checking it\'s working for you
2017-09-11T20:42:20 <gtirloni> that\'s reassuring
2017-09-11T20:42:24 <mrtyler> lol
2017-09-11T20:42:29 <mrtyler> thanks for helping find rough edges
2017-09-11T20:42:31 <gtirloni> at least i haven\'t broken anything (i hope) this time
2017-09-11T20:42:35 <mrtyler> haha
2017-09-11T20:42:46 <gtirloni> i\'ll try again tomorrow and see if i can find out what\'s wrong.. will let you know. thanks
2017-09-11T20:42:52 <mrtyler> i\'ll poke around a bit and let you know if i find anything
2017-09-11T20:43:03 <mrtyler> in particular with those AWS_* variables
2017-09-11T20:43:10 <mrtyler> have a good evening
2017-09-11T20:43:15 <gtirloni> cool, thanks. you too

2017-09-11T17:31:27 <Bosmon> Hi there alanharnum
2017-09-11T17:31:35 <Bosmon> It\'s been a relatively casual discussion
2017-09-11T17:31:35 <alanharnum> Hello BOSMON
2017-09-11T17:31:48 <Bosmon> Mostly focused on the things which are more or less known as "graph databases"
2017-09-11T17:31:53 <alanharnum> i figured, but thought it was worth asking
2017-09-11T17:31:58 <alanharnum> ah, neo4j and such?
2017-09-11T17:31:59 <Bosmon> We discovered a need for what could be called "socially sharded persistence"
2017-09-11T17:32:17 <Bosmon> In which each community of interest can freely aggregate what could be called kinds of "overlays" to a dataset
2017-09-11T17:32:25 <alanharnum> interesting
2017-09-11T17:32:38 <Bosmon> But overlay is a misleading term in that it implies that there is any kind of central, authoritative dataset
2017-09-11T17:32:50 <Bosmon> But basically we want a persistence solution that does for persistence what Infusion does for general programming : P
2017-09-11T17:33:14 * alanharnum has read some things about graph databases, especially neo4j, has not done an implementation using one.
2017-09-11T17:33:16 <Bosmon> Yes, neo4j was one of the few things we entertained
2017-09-11T17:33:24 <Bosmon> But it is a pretty gross possibility, for various reasons
2017-09-11T17:33:45 <Bosmon> "orientDB" is another possibility
2017-09-11T17:34:03 <Bosmon> Seems to have been getting on pretty well since we last looked at it
2017-09-11T17:34:23 <alanharnum> hadn\'t heard of orientDB, but it looks interesting
2017-09-11T17:35:01 <Bosmon> But something about the "graph database" concept seems inherently suspicious
2017-09-11T17:35:19 <Bosmon> My feeling is that if it gives us what we want, it will be as a possibly unanticipated design consequence
2017-09-11T17:35:35 <Bosmon> We don\'t want primarily to store information ABOUT a graph
2017-09-11T17:35:57 <Bosmon> But we want our overall query network to support a graph structure
2017-09-11T17:36:09 <Bosmon> Now it may well be that you can\'t achieve one of these things without achieving the other
2017-09-11T17:36:16 <Bosmon> But this isn\'t necessarily clear to me at this point
2017-09-11T17:37:10 <Bosmon> What we really want is for each "node" in such a graph to hold an arbitrary sized shared of the overall data
2017-09-11T17:37:27 <Bosmon> Sorry, shared -> shard
2017-09-11T17:38:16 <Bosmon> And for a "query" to consist of, "Fetch me all the shards from nodes which are directly connected to a particular root node, and merge them together so they appear to constitute the entire dataset"
2017-09-11T17:38:31 <Bosmon> And then of course for the *actual* queries to be run against this merged, pooled dataset
2017-09-11T17:38:46 <Bosmon> Now it\'s not clear to me that graph databases will strongly cater to this use case
2017-09-11T17:38:59 <Bosmon> But I haven\'t seen signs of any other identifiable persistence paradigm that will
2017-09-11T17:39:35 <alanharnum> i wonder, just speculatively, if looking for this in a single tool is the best approach, or if these concerns need to be split apart
2017-09-11T17:39:54 <Bosmon> Well, it seems like one concern to me (the use case I\'ve just outlined)
2017-09-11T17:40:15 <Bosmon> Catering to this kind of query model seems to imply the entire solution is architected around it
2017-09-11T17:40:41 <alanharnum> that is to say, maybe handle persistence in one system, and indexing and querying in another that can be tuned to emulate the characteristics of Infusion that are desired (Elasticsearch, FE)
2017-09-11T17:41:09 <Bosmon> alanharnum - yes, it\'s possible
2017-09-11T17:41:19 <Bosmon> Actually we were planning to use git repositories for the actual raw persistence :)
2017-09-11T17:41:27 <Bosmon> So what I meant by "persistence" here entirely was the indexing and querying system
2017-09-11T17:41:34 <alanharnum> ah, yes
2017-09-11T17:41:49 <Bosmon> But this will in the end amount to a very specialised kind of persistence
2017-09-11T17:42:11 <Bosmon> In that the system will have to build up particularly refined and optimised data structures in order to support it
2017-09-11T17:42:50 <Bosmon> It will have to be quite opportunistic in identifying repeatedly queried "clusters" in the dataset
2017-09-11T17:43:03 <Bosmon> Since it couldn\'t possibly afford to optimise for all possible queries of the kind I outlined
2017-09-11T17:43:22 <alanharnum> yeah, so it sounds like a lot of the concern is not (as you say) persistence per se, but highly tunable and customizable indexing and querying
2017-09-11T17:43:35 <Bosmon> Well, I guess if all the queries are of the form "neighbours of this node" it could conceivably optimise for them
2017-09-11T17:43:51 <Bosmon> But you would want such a thing to be able to support kinds of "ad hoc" queries as well
2017-09-11T17:43:59 <alanharnum> which makes my mind go to things like Solr or Elasticsearch (both built on top of Lucene)
2017-09-11T17:44:08 <Bosmon> But the space of these is exponential in the size of the graph
2017-09-11T17:45:05 <Bosmon> alanharnum - yes, the Lucene query mode is impossibly primitive, in comparison
2017-09-11T17:45:32 <Bosmon> It\'s a step backwards, compared to CouchDB
2017-09-11T17:45:43 <Bosmon> Which at least allows "keys" to be given an arbitrary, ad hoc structure
2017-09-11T17:45:56 <alanharnum> yeah, I am not thinking of something like raw Lucene, but systems built on top of it
2017-09-11T17:46:13 <Bosmon> alanharnum - right, but the underlying problem is in the "persistence", if you will
2017-09-11T17:46:27 <Bosmon> Which is why I somewhat misleadingly went on about persistence a lot
2017-09-11T17:46:53 <Bosmon> But the problem with both CouchDB and Lucene and all similar solutions is that keys are confined to a single linear, totally ordered line
2017-09-11T17:47:26 <Bosmon> That is, each index you have on the dataset is a single linear, total order - and it is this way because of the way the index is persisted on disk
2017-09-11T17:47:40 <Bosmon> So if you want to go beyond this query model, you have to go beyond this persistence model for indexes
2017-09-11T17:47:50 <Bosmon> Which is where I was hoping that graph databases might be some kind of improvement : P
2017-09-11T17:47:58 <Bosmon> But perhaps it is still turtles all the way down
2017-09-11T17:48:08 <Bosmon> But where there is ignorance, there is possibility : P
2017-09-11T17:48:22 <Bosmon> That is, I\'m ignorant of how graph databases do persistence, and so there is a possibility that they might do what we want : P
2017-09-11T17:48:56 <alanharnum> i don\'t think i entirely understand what we want, and i am definitely also ignorant of graph DB persistence
2017-09-11T17:48:58 <alanharnum> :)
2017-09-11T17:49:26 <Bosmon> So, for example, a fundamentally different persistence model is that of geo databases, which inherently have to be able to optimise freeform queries over a 2d grid
2017-09-11T17:49:42 <Bosmon> So they\'ll use particular datastructures like quadtrees which are optimised for this
2017-09-11T17:49:51 <Bosmon> But that still just kicks us upstairs one dimension
2017-09-11T17:50:10 <Bosmon> Ideally we want a database that could optimise queries with arbitrary numbers of free dimensions : P
2017-09-11T17:50:27 <Bosmon> At least, that\'s what I think we might want
2017-09-11T17:50:58 <alanharnum> ah, ok, i understand better
2017-09-11T17:51:29 <Bosmon> But, basically, if you look at the persistence model that your favorite database uses for queries, and find out that it is a B-tree (as it almost univerally is) you know it\'s not going to deal with problems of the kind we\'re interested in
2017-09-11T17:52:25 <alanharnum> hm
2017-09-11T17:52:59 <alanharnum> i wonder (to the extend I understand this concern) if we couldn\'t repurpose a GIS database, or an extension like PostGIS, at least experimentally
2017-09-11T17:53:19 <Bosmon> Well, ultimately being hard-wired to help with 2d queries would probably make it even less suitable than Couch
2017-09-11T17:53:39 <Bosmon> At least Couch squeezes every last atom of flexibility from the B-tree model, by allowing arbitrary JSON structures as keys
2017-09-11T17:54:40 <Bosmon> Whereas a GIS database expects that all of its boundaries consist simply of NUMBERS
2017-09-11T17:54:58 <Bosmon> How could we cover the surface of the earth coordinatised by arbitrary JSON structures :)
2017-09-11T17:55:40 <alanharnum> yes, i suppose even a 3d spatial database lacks the 4th, 5th or other dimensions also needed :)
