2017-11-09T17:06:01 <ussjoin> Just a random note: AWS now has c5 instances, which are stupidly powerful. A c5.18xlarge has 72 cores and 144GB of RAM for $3.06/hour. A c5.9xl has half that for half the cost ($1.53/hour). An 18xl is overpriced on Spot, but a 9xl is currently going for $0.5187/hour on Spot.

2017-11-09T17:47:47 <cindyli> amatas: fluid-work is busy so let\'s move our conversation here
2017-11-09T17:48:20 <cindyli> as u know, i\'ve been re-triggering the running of CI on my pull request to get around the "no enough disk" error
2017-11-09T17:48:28 <cindyli> now the CI fails with even more error
2017-11-09T17:48:43 <cindyli> at step of running node tests, it hits this error - Error in `/usr/bin/node\': double free or corruption
2017-11-09T17:49:00 <cindyli> scroll to the bottom of this page to see it - https://ci.gpii.net/job/universal-node-tests/565/console

2017-11-09T18:49:35 <amatas> It seems that now the tests run in the latest VM
2017-11-09T18:49:38 <cindyli> yay! thanks, do you know what\'s going on
2017-11-09T18:49:53 <amatas> I hope that the next tests run without problem
2017-11-09T18:50:01 <cindyli> because of the VM template update?
2017-11-09T18:50:19 <amatas> It was the lack of space because it was running in an old version of the VM
2017-11-09T18:50:36 <cindyli> great. thanks for the help, amatas
