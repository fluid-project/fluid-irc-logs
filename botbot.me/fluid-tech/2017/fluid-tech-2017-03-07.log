2017-03-07T13:18:29 <kasparnet> hi Bosmon
2017-03-07T13:18:40 <kasparnet> so as I was saying on skype
2017-03-07T13:18:41 <kasparnet> I\'m still working on the matchmaker
2017-03-07T13:18:47 <kasparnet> and am having a really hard time gettings settings set ahead of time for the integration tests... That is, I\'ve managed to get it working with the regular integration tests
2017-03-07T13:18:54 <kasparnet> by setting values in the "settingsStore" of our testCaseHolder
2017-03-07T13:19:00 <kasparnet> which is working fine for some of the basic functionality
2017-03-07T13:19:57 <kasparnet> (was working*)
2017-03-07T13:20:28 <Bosmon> Have you followed the approach which is used here:
2017-03-07T13:20:29 <Bosmon> https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/tests/JournalIntegrationTests.js#L213
2017-03-07T13:28:42 <kasparnet> not really
2017-03-07T13:28:44 <kasparnet> :)
2017-03-07T13:28:58 <kasparnet> but in that approach you also just add new mocks, right?

2017-03-07T13:29:15 <kasparnet> Bosmon:
2017-03-07T13:30:02 <kasparnet> whereas, I want to affect the settingStore of the individual (actual) handlers

2017-03-07T13:53:15 <Bosmon> kasparnet - well, it\'s not very different, is it
2017-03-07T13:54:29 <kasparnet> hmm... I guess perhaps not
2017-03-07T13:54:51 <Bosmon> So, what scheme are you using, and what is going wrong with it?
2017-03-07T13:55:04 <kasparnet> so I would basically just run a function like that at the start of the test, that would in turn call the relevant settingshandlers .set function
2017-03-07T13:55:33 <kasparnet> Bosmon: well, currently I\'m populating the "settingsStore" of the testCaseHolder (and NOT the mockSettingsHandlers)
2017-03-07T13:55:49 <kasparnet> which works fine when testing the initial state of the applications, etc
2017-03-07T13:56:21 <kasparnet> but not so well when part of the lifecycle managers task is checking which applications are running as the first thing on a login
2017-03-07T13:56:38 <kasparnet> since it queries the settingshandlers .get functions
2017-03-07T13:56:55 <kasparnet> whose settingsStores will all be empty
2017-03-07T13:57:30 <kasparnet> But I guess it might be as simple as just actually .set\'ting stuff as the first thing in the test
2017-03-07T13:58:16 <kasparnet> ... If that\'s the case, I curse you (for no reason at all - other than perhaps my lack of a working brain)
2017-03-07T13:58:32 <Bosmon> Well, the settingsStore on the testCaseHolder is just a special crummy workflow that we use for certain tests with a simple, stereotypical workflow
2017-03-07T13:59:08 <Bosmon> I guess we still use it here too, just to reuse some of the test fixtures....
2017-03-07T13:59:19 <Bosmon> Yes, settings stuff first in the tests sounds fine : P
2017-03-07T14:00:38 <kasparnet> damn you, antranig... damn you
2017-03-07T14:00:59 <Bosmon> Thank you, thank you
2017-03-07T14:01:01 <Bosmon> Damn you also :)
2017-03-07T14:01:13 <kasparnet> why, thank you!
2017-03-07T14:15:21 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-03-07T14:39:35 <kasparnet> Bosmon: ... is there a way to change the allowed responsetime for tests in the infusion framework
2017-03-07T14:40:31 <kasparnet> I occasionally NVDA takes a bit longer to launch/kill than the allowed 5 sec
2017-03-07T14:45:21 <Bosmon> kasparnet - I assume you mean this one: https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/testing/src/Acceptance.js#L35
2017-03-07T14:45:30 <Bosmon> The timeout within Infusion just produces a warning message
2017-03-07T14:46:16 <kasparnet> ah, yes, that one
2017-03-07T14:46:18 <kasparnet> thanks Bosmon

2017-03-07T19:35:54 <cindyli> avtar1: i pushed the legend code into my GPII-2204 a few mins ago, shall i wait around 15 mins for the container to rebuild?
2017-03-07T19:37:04 <avtar1> hey cindyli
2017-03-07T19:37:18 <avtar1> yes, it should be done deploying by then
2017-03-07T19:37:44 <cindyli> ok
2017-03-07T19:38:00 <cindyli> avtar1: our demo index is using gpii/universal - https://github.com/cindyli/qi-dashboard-frontend-demo/blob/GPII-2204/demos/index.html#L13
2017-03-07T19:38:02 <cindyli> everywhere
2017-03-07T19:38:21 <cindyli> do you think i should change it to point to p4a-test/nuts-and-bolts?
2017-03-07T19:39:21 * clown joined the channel
2017-03-07T19:39:47 <avtar1> cindyli: yes, that make sense for the demo
2017-03-07T19:40:14 <cindyli> ok
2017-03-07T19:45:25 <gtirloni> avtar1 cindyli: did you add a webhook to cindyli/qi-dashboard-frontend-demo pointing it to jenkins?
2017-03-07T19:45:38 <cindyli> gtirloni: i added that yesterday
2017-03-07T19:45:41 <gtirloni> ok
2017-03-07T19:45:45 <cindyli> hope i did it correctly
2017-03-07T19:48:12 <gtirloni> i don\'t see a POST request from GH to Jenkins, that\'s why i\'m asking
2017-03-07T19:51:01 <gtirloni> cindyli: can you confirm if you chose "Jenkins (Git Plugin)" or "Jenkins (Github plugin)" for the webhook?

2017-03-07T20:13:26 <cindyli> avtar1: the container rebuild didn\'t happen
2017-03-07T20:15:34 * stegru joined the channel
2017-03-07T20:19:47 <avtar1> cindyli: is the webhook active? there should be a checkbox in your repo settings to indicate that
2017-03-07T20:20:15 <avtar1> i\'ll trigger the job
2017-03-07T20:20:27 <cindyli> avtar1: it is active. checkbox checked
2017-03-07T20:20:34 <cindyli> thanks, avtar1
2017-03-07T21:06:19 <cindyli> avtar1: the demo looks good. in case you\'d like to double check - https://qi.gpii.net/demos/
2017-03-07T21:07:49 <avtar1> cindyli: looks awesome :D
2017-03-07T21:31:15 * clown joined the channel
2017-03-07T21:33:24 <alanharnum> nice, cindyli!
2017-03-07T21:33:40 <alanharnum> I think that solution of removing the background for the step chart works well
