2017-02-21T16:18:54 <colinclark> kasparne_, Bosmon: Do you happen to know where we can find a link to the discussion we had a while back about logging requirements?
2017-02-21T16:20:08 <Bosmon> colinclark - can you remind which one, particularly?
2017-02-21T16:20:16 <Bosmon> Do you recall a couple of things we decided?
2017-02-21T16:20:18 <colinclark> Well, I'm not exactly sure
2017-02-21T16:20:46 <colinclark> we just have some vague memory of a meeting we had in the last little while, which discussed logging
2017-02-21T16:20:57 <colinclark> and wondered that triggered any more specific memories for you :)
2017-02-21T16:22:06 <colinclark> gtirloni remembers making some recommendations regarding log formats
2017-02-21T16:24:52 <Bosmon> colinclark - I find this: https://pad.gpii.net/p/logging-discussion-13g4n99
2017-02-21T16:25:08 <Bosmon> But this is not one you were present at
2017-02-21T16:25:28 <colinclark> thank you!
2017-02-21T16:26:13 <Bosmon> Neither was Gio
2017-02-21T16:26:26 <colinclark> this one seems to be the one gtirloni was thinking of: https://pad.gpii.net/p/201612-washingtonf2f-ih1b4nns
2017-02-21T16:26:29 <Bosmon> Oh wait
2017-02-21T16:26:32 <Bosmon> There are 2 meetings in 1 pad
2017-02-21T16:26:55 <Bosmon> On line 32 starts a further meeting that had both you and Gio
