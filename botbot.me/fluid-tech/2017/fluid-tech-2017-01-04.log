2017-01-04T20:29:17 <Sitesh> colinclark sir, is infusion works better in linux distributions ?
2017-01-04T20:30:07 <colinclark> Hi Sitesh, sorry, I don't think I quite understand
2017-01-04T20:30:17 <colinclark> Better in Linux distributions than what?
2017-01-04T20:30:41 <Sitesh> can we install infusion in windows ?
2017-01-04T20:30:53 <colinclark> Yes, of course
2017-01-04T20:31:18 <Sitesh> what is generally preferred ?
2017-01-04T20:31:31 <colinclark> There is no preference
2017-01-04T20:31:38 <Sitesh> ok
2017-01-04T20:31:49 <colinclark> It's a cross-platform technology supported by a community that uses dfiferent platforms
2017-01-04T20:32:26 <Sitesh> ok but i was facing some problems today installing using NPM.
2017-01-04T20:36:36 * stegru has quit
2017-01-04T20:37:57 <Sitesh> first i hv to download a release right ?
2017-01-04T20:38:11 <Sitesh> from https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/releases
2017-01-04T20:38:26 <colinclark> You could download a release, yes
2017-01-04T20:38:37 <colinclark> or you could clone the repository with Git
2017-01-04T20:39:29 <colinclark> A release, though, is typically intended to be used as-is, I think
2017-01-04T20:40:00 <colinclark> If you want to make your own custom builds you'll probably want to clone the repo
2017-01-04T20:40:18 <colinclark> And for building applications these days, you may prefer to install it via npm into your project
2017-01-04T20:40:29 <colinclark> there are several options, each tailored to a particular use case
2017-01-04T20:41:08 <Sitesh> hmm
2017-01-04T20:42:11 <Sitesh> i downloaded infusion-all-2.0.0-minified.zip
2017-01-04T20:45:00 * jessm has quit
2017-01-04T20:46:41 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-01-04T20:47:40 * alanharnum has quit
2017-01-04T20:47:41 <Sitesh> the release \x0301 infusion-all-2.0.0-minified.zip\x0301 will do right
2017-01-04T20:47:46 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-01-04T20:47:57 <colinclark> I guess it depends what you want to do with it, Sitesh :)
2017-01-04T20:48:17 <colinclark> That package is a minified production release
2017-01-04T20:48:43 <Sitesh> for contributing i need the platform so that i can really check for bugs
2017-01-04T20:48:54 <colinclark> yeah, that's probably not what you want
2017-01-04T20:49:03 <Sitesh> then?
2017-01-04T20:49:15 <colinclark> if you want to develop Infusion itself, you'll want to clone the repository from Github
2017-01-04T20:49:18 <colinclark> as I mentioned earlier
2017-01-04T20:49:48 <colinclark> https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/
2017-01-04T20:49:56 * stegru joined the channel
2017-01-04T20:49:59 <Sitesh> ya thats i have done
2017-01-04T20:51:19 <colinclark> Great!
2017-01-04T20:54:02 <Sitesh> then what should i do
2017-01-04T20:58:41 <colinclark> I'm not sure, Sitesh
2017-01-04T20:58:45 <colinclark> What do you want to do next?
2017-01-04T20:59:58 <Sitesh> i want to use infusion, so after cloning what should i do
2017-01-04T21:03:04 <colinclark> How do you want to use Infusion?
2017-01-04T21:03:09 <colinclark> Use it to build what?
2017-01-04T21:04:02 <Sitesh> no i just want to contribute to fix some bugs and propose some new ideas. So how to start with
2017-01-04T21:04:20 <colinclark> Well, Infusion is a development framework
2017-01-04T21:04:27 <colinclark> so you might choose to use it to develop a project
2017-01-04T21:04:55 <colinclark> or perhaps you can start by trying out the different demos that ship with Infusion
2017-01-04T21:06:01 <Sitesh> i just want to make contributions to infusion
2017-01-04T21:10:14 <Sitesh> colinclark sir, basically I am an undergraduate who is interested in contributing to this project and GSOC will be great kick start for me.
2017-01-04T21:11:26 <Sitesh> so i have started reading the documentation http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/ . So what are the things i should do so that i can contribute on this project
2017-01-04T21:11:42 <Sitesh> Like from the setup onwards.
2017-01-04T21:12:55 <colinclark> Well, Sitesh, that's something you're going to have to discover based on your interests and exploration of Infusion
2017-01-04T21:13:12 <colinclark> I'd recommend building a small application with Infusion, and getting to know it that way
2017-01-04T21:13:27 <colinclark> just reading documentation in the abstract can be very edifying, but it might not help you with starting points
2017-01-04T21:13:49 <colinclark> alternatively, you can look through the issue tracker and see some of the simpler bugs and look into how to fix them
2017-01-04T21:13:55 <Sitesh> yes thats what i want. So that by making an application i can understand what are the new things i can incorporate
2017-01-04T21:14:04 <colinclark> yes, that's one way
2017-01-04T21:14:11 <colinclark> I think you'll find that you won't get a step-by-step recipe for how to get involved
2017-01-04T21:14:28 <Sitesh> yes sir sure
2017-01-04T21:15:00 <colinclark> but rather you'll have to get to know some things on your own, and follow your interest
2017-01-04T21:15:03 <colinclark> build some stuff, try it out
2017-01-04T21:15:05 <colinclark> and go from there
2017-01-04T21:15:11 <Sitesh> ya
2017-01-04T21:17:21 <Sitesh> ok i got it
2017-01-04T21:17:32 <colinclark> Cool!
2017-01-04T21:18:20 <Sitesh> Like we have many framework Bootstrap for CSS, CodeIgniter,Laravel for PHP and Infusion is same for JS. using these files we can develop some javascript application. Right sir ?
2017-01-04T21:18:56 <colinclark> yes, that's right
2017-01-04T21:20:08 <Sitesh> is it like to understand it better i need to develop a small application first . Or without a small application direct jump into the code will also do ?
2017-01-04T21:20:54 <colinclark> Sitesh: I think you'll find it pretty hard to orient yourself if you just dive straight into the code
2017-01-04T21:21:04 <colinclark> I mean, again, it's probably quite an edifying activity
2017-01-04T21:21:06 <Sitesh> ya
2017-01-04T21:21:13 <colinclark> but maybe a bit challenging to start
2017-01-04T21:21:24 <colinclark> I'd recommend building a small application related to something you're interested in
2017-01-04T21:21:29 <colinclark> and then perhaps making some notes about the experience
2017-01-04T21:22:00 <colinclark> things that help describe what Infusion is to other people who are coming along new to it
2017-01-04T21:22:06 <colinclark> or things that describe how to build a simple application
2017-01-04T21:22:07 <colinclark> etc.
2017-01-04T21:22:23 <Sitesh> yes
2017-01-04T21:24:52 <Sitesh> thnx a lot sir
