2017-04-21T15:40:20 <alanharnum> cindyli: the audio was a bit distorted for me, but did I hear correctly that on mobile, the responsive UIO is appearing as the desktop one?
2017-04-21T15:41:18 <cindyli> that's correct, alanharnum
2017-04-21T15:41:54 * amatas has quit
2017-04-21T15:42:13 <cindyli> but on a smaller browser window, UIO shows the mobile version without any problem, which is interesting
2017-04-21T15:42:18 <alanharnum> cindyli: what mobile are you testing on?
2017-04-21T15:42:52 <cindyli> alanharnum: i've tested on my iphone, xcode iphone simulator and chrome mobile device simulator. all same issue
2017-04-21T15:44:15 <alanharnum> cindyli: if you'd like me to test it on my Android phone, let me know; might help isolate the issue
2017-04-21T15:45:08 <cindyli> that would be helpful. let me clean up the code and push to github. thanks, alanharnum.

2017-04-21T16:01:24 <cindyli> alanharnum: my work so far on floeproject.org with the responsive UIO - https://github.com/cindyli/floeproject.org/tree/FLOE-502
2017-04-21T16:03:50 <alanharnum> cindyli: did you remove the main body content to work on debugging the issue with UIO? just want to make sure i'm seeing that correctly.
2017-04-21T16:04:03 <alanharnum> looks like it's out of the source code, but double checking
2017-04-21T16:05:03 <cindyli> right. forgot that, putting it back
2017-04-21T16:06:34 <cindyli> alanharnum: done
2017-04-21T16:08:30 <alanharnum> cindyli: ok, see same issue on my Galaxy S5 - site is responsive, UIO in iframe is not
2017-04-21T16:09:33 <cindyli> great. thanks, alanharnum. now we know it happens both ios and android
2017-04-21T16:11:05 <alanharnum> yeah, I suspect that means it's an issue with how the mobile browsers handle iframe size - not sure exactly what mechanism is being used to determine if it should use the mobile layout or not
2017-04-21T16:12:09 <alanharnum> but since it's happening on both, it's not something iOS / Mobile Safari specific
