2017-08-15T16:02:52 <mrtyler> what room are we using?
2017-08-15T16:03:05 <gtirloni> i think this one: https://global.gotomeeting.com/join/619028605
2017-08-15T16:03:34 <gtirloni> looks like they\'re aware: http://status.gotomeeting.com/
2017-08-15T16:03:53 <amatas> I had to refresh several times to get in to the main page
2017-08-15T16:04:56 <mrtyler> i have a stuck gotomeeting process trying to launch
2017-08-15T16:05:42 <amatas> what if we use vidyo?
2017-08-15T16:06:48 <mrtyler> vidyo desktop stuck in "starting up..." which is maybe something it does and there\'s a workaround i don\'t remember
2017-08-15T16:07:51 <amatas> :(
2017-08-15T16:07:55 <mrtyler> vidyo client loaded
2017-08-15T16:08:01 <mrtyler> gtm failed; trying again
2017-08-15T16:08:01 <amatas> do you all like webrtc?
2017-08-15T16:08:26 <gtirloni> webrtc works fine here, that\'s how i use vidyo since the latest fedora updates (vidyodeskop only segfaults now)
2017-08-15T16:08:26 <mrtyler> systems where i\'ve never encountered this kind of nonsense: hangouts, zoom, skype

2017-08-15T18:20:02 <mrtyler> i don\'t think they got very far
2017-08-15T18:20:11 <mrtyler> but it is a cool idea

2017-08-15T18:22:04 <gtirloni> ah, interesting. i only heard of zipkin because i saw a demo sock-shop app which they have created and/or helped a lot.. didn\'t know that was it

2017-08-15T18:22:30 <gtirloni> i don\'t know much about this space, but it looks nice.. more information is usually nice
2017-08-15T18:25:23 <mrtyler> i also need to do more homework on colin\'s friend charity.wtf
2017-08-15T18:25:35 <mrtyler> she is ceo of Honeycomb IO which talks about "observability" in distributed systems
2017-08-15T18:25:48 <mrtyler> which is what zipkin and xray are sort of after, aiui
