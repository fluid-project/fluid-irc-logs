2017-05-23T16:27:21 <gtirloni> amatas, how are we updating all those gitlab repositories we are using? is there a script monitoring github?
2017-05-23T16:28:48 <amatas> there is nothing automatically synchronizing the repositories. All the updates are made manually using multiple origins in our checkouts
2017-05-23T16:29:19 <gtirloni> ah, so when you commit something, you\'re running `git push gitlab` manually for now?

2017-05-23T16:54:04 * kasparnet joined the channel
2017-05-23T16:54:19 <gtirloni> thanks, just wanted to confirm if we had a background process in place or not at this point
2017-05-23T16:56:31 <amatas> sorry, gtirloni indeed, we don\'t have a background process that sync the repositories now
2017-05-23T16:56:45 <gtirloni> ok thanks
2017-05-23T16:57:09 <gtirloni> do we have a meeting in 4min? i vaguely remember an email from sandra but i can\'t find it anywhere and there\'s nothing in my calendar
2017-05-23T16:57:51 <gtirloni> oh may 30
2017-05-23T16:58:08 <gtirloni> all my meetings from sandra as prefixed with "updated invitation -" so it\'s hard to see
2017-05-23T16:58:22 <gtirloni> *are
2017-05-23T16:59:01 * simonjb joined the channel
2017-05-23T17:07:36 <amatas> the next monday is holiday for the US, that\'s why we changed the ops meeting to tuesday
2017-05-23T17:09:40 <amatas> gtirloni: regarding the issue GPII-2362, if you spin up a clean Fedora VM and make "ls -dla /home/vagrant/.pki", which permissions do you see for that directory?
2017-05-23T17:10:07 <gtirloni> [vagrant@localhost ~]$ ls -ld .pki/
2017-05-23T17:10:07 <gtirloni> drwxr----- 3 vagrant vagrant 19 May 15 12:02 .pki/
2017-05-23T17:12:33 <gtirloni> amatas: https://www.pastery.net/hpptxy/
2017-05-23T17:13:26 <amatas> I\'m updating the box
2017-05-23T17:14:34 <gtirloni> with what box/vagrant/vbox version were you able to reproduce it like you said in the jira?
2017-05-23T17:14:50 <amatas> ls -lhad .pki
2017-05-23T17:14:53 <amatas> drwxr----- 3 root root 19 Dec  9 00:15 .pki
2017-05-23T17:14:56 <amatas> 0.1.2
2017-05-23T17:15:45 <gtirloni> weird, let me use 0.1.2
2017-05-23T17:17:21 <amatas> ok, in 0.1.3 the permissions are good
2017-05-23T17:17:48 <gtirloni> yep, issue shows up in 0.1.2
2017-05-23T17:18:38 <amatas> and did you use the fix I have in the clean.sh script for the build of 0.1.3?
2017-05-23T17:19:26 <gtirloni> yep, it was included in the dnf timeout PR
2017-05-23T17:20:35 <amatas> well, so I guess that the issue 2362 is fixed in the latest VM box
2017-05-23T17:23:11 <gtirloni> looks like it. i wonder what\'s running as root and creating that .pki directory.. that\'s weird
2017-05-23T17:23:41 <gtirloni> but the shared folders are working as expected. for a moment i thought the issue was vbox.. but as i pasted into the jira, the permissions are correct

2017-05-23T18:58:09 <gtirloni> looks like cloud foundry is the next platform to drop its own container orchestration in favor of kubernetes
