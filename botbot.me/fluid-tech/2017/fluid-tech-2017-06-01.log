2017-06-01T14:36:16 <simonjb> hi there jhernandez_
2017-06-01T14:37:48 <simonjb> jhernandez_: just saw your email response -- thanks!
2017-06-01T14:39:20 <simonjb> hi michelled, for the APCP demo machine for Colin, jhernandez_ is suggesting to use the gpii-app hst-2017 branch
2017-06-01T14:39:41 <simonjb> does that seem consistent with your thinking?
2017-06-01T14:40:45 <simonjb> this will pull in suitable versions of windows and universal?
2017-06-01T14:42:29 <jhernandez_> simonjb: sorry, I missed the IRC notification
2017-06-01T14:42:37 <simonjb> np :)
2017-06-01T14:43:22 <jhernandez_> so, as I said, if you want to show the "latest", then I guess that you should use gpii-app
2017-06-01T14:43:59 <jhernandez_> and yes, it\'s pointing to "safe" versions of windows and universal
2017-06-01T14:44:07 <simonjb> and from this repo: https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/tree/hst-2017 right?
2017-06-01T14:44:11 <jhernandez_> (or at least it was the case last time I tested it)
2017-06-01T14:44:14 <jhernandez_> right
2017-06-01T14:44:18 <jhernandez_> that branch
2017-06-01T14:44:28 <simonjb> awesome
2017-06-01T14:44:29 <michelled> yep, that matches what I thought simonjb
2017-06-01T14:44:52 <michelled> jhernandez_: do you know if that\'s the branch that kavya tests?
2017-06-01T14:45:24 <jhernandez_> michelled: yes, she always use our installers, which come from building the hst-2017 branch of gpii-app
2017-06-01T14:45:52 <simonjb> do we have any dependencies on particular Node.js version? I just installed the latest LTS 6.10.3
2017-06-01T14:46:04 <simonjb> that should work?
2017-06-01T14:46:31 <jhernandez_> simonjb: it will use  the version of node.js that electron ships ;)
2017-06-01T14:46:43 <jhernandez_> so don\'t worry about conflicting versions of node.js
2017-06-01T14:47:37 <simonjb> jhernandez_: I\'m new to Electron -- do I need to install anything or npm install will pull everything down?
2017-06-01T14:47:59 <jhernandez_> npm install should make the magic to happen
2017-06-01T14:48:01 * javjarfer joined the channel
2017-06-01T14:48:05 <simonjb> nice
2017-06-01T14:48:29 <jhernandez_> it\'s true that I always use our vagrant box, but it shouldn\'t be a problem
2017-06-01T14:49:08 <jhernandez_> the only thing, you need to install the user listeners separately and install them
2017-06-01T14:49:13 <simonjb> thanks very much jhernandez_ I\'ll try to build it now
2017-06-01T14:49:18 <jhernandez_> nice
2017-06-01T14:49:22 <jhernandez_> let me know how it goes
2017-06-01T14:49:25 <jhernandez_> ;)
2017-06-01T14:49:42 <simonjb> jhernandez_: where do I get the user listeners from?
2017-06-01T14:50:02 <simonjb> do they get built with the windows repo?
2017-06-01T14:50:19 <simonjb> and then I just need to install?
2017-06-01T14:50:31 <simonjb> or is there more to it?
2017-06-01T14:52:52 <jhernandez_> no, you have to build them yourself as far as I remember
2017-06-01T14:53:10 * michelled has quit
2017-06-01T14:54:17 <simonjb> jhernandez_: where do they live?
2017-06-01T14:54:18 <jhernandez_> the windows repo builds them (as gpii-app does) and include them as part of the installer, but only when you do the whole provisioning
2017-06-01T14:54:29 <jhernandez_> in the windows repo
2017-06-01T14:54:30 <simonjb> cool
2017-06-01T14:54:45 <jhernandez_> https://github.com/GPII/windows/tree/master/listeners
2017-06-01T14:54:47 <jhernandez_> :)
2017-06-01T14:55:20 <simonjb> jhernandez_: and the provisioning script(s) should give me some hints on how to install?
2017-06-01T14:55:22 <gloob> simonjb: we freeze some gpii/apcp demos here https://gitlab.com/gpii-demos/gpii-app
2017-06-01T14:56:03 <jhernandez_> gloob: but these are those that include the features for sven and simi, isn\'t it?
2017-06-01T14:56:10 <gloob> although the two new mainstream features needs additional work in the installation that make the setup process harder than just deploy gpii-app
2017-06-01T14:56:18 <gloob> jhernandez_: and dpi
2017-06-01T14:56:19 * the-t-in-rtf1 has quit
2017-06-01T14:57:53 <simonjb> gloob: if I wanted to also run the work that you and javjarfer have done on UI automation, do you have pointers on how to do that? -- I\'m setting up a demo machine for Colin to take to the APCP meetings next week
2017-06-01T14:58:31 <simonjb> what\'s the relationship between https://gitlab.com/gpii-demos/gpii-app and https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/tree/hst-2017 ?
2017-06-01T14:59:47 <gloob> it\'s a mirror with an extra branch called demo-mainstream
2017-06-01T15:00:29 <amatas> simonjb: also you can get the latest "stable" installer that the HST is using here: https://get.gpii.net/
2017-06-01T15:00:35 <gloob> simonjb: we are running to integrate with GPII for our demo next week, currently we don\'t have so much installation/compilation documentation
2017-06-01T15:01:46 <simonjb> thanks amatas, I think I\'d like to install from source but it does make sense I think to run code close to the HST and what Kavya is testing
2017-06-01T15:02:18 <simonjb> gloob: what\'s demo-mainstream?
2017-06-01T15:02:42 <simonjb> sorry for all the questions and thanks everyone for the help :)
2017-06-01T15:02:58 <simonjb> it\'s been a while since I set up GPII
2017-06-01T15:04:46 <gloob> simonjb: custom branch incorporating new work for gpii we wanted to demos
2017-06-01T15:05:16 <simonjb> gloob: including the UI Automation work?
2017-06-01T15:05:24 <simonjb> or other stuff?
2017-06-01T15:05:41 <gloob> no
2017-06-01T15:05:44 <gloob> other stuff
2017-06-01T15:06:28 <gloob> simonjb: two new demo personas, simi (Desktop simplification) and sven (Window10 to Windows7 morpher)
2017-06-01T15:07:09 <simonjb> gloob, jhernandez_: Do you think it makes sense for me to use https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/tree/hst-2017 or https://gitlab.com/gpii-demos/gpii-app
2017-06-01T15:07:51 <jhernandez_> well, it depends on what you want to demo
2017-06-01T15:08:04 <simonjb> yes, you\'re right
2017-06-01T15:08:14 <jhernandez_> but in terms of setting it up - I would go for using an installer
2017-06-01T15:08:49 <simonjb> it\'s for Colin -- I will check with him when he\'s available
2017-06-01T15:09:07 <simonjb> jhernandez_: using an installer is which option?
2017-06-01T15:09:15 <jhernandez_> both :)
2017-06-01T15:09:42 <simonjb> now I\'m confused
2017-06-01T15:09:54 <amatas> both branches build an installer at the provisioning of the VM
2017-06-01T15:09:57 <jhernandez_> both versions/branches create installers at the end of the provisioning phase
2017-06-01T15:10:04 <simonjb> ok
2017-06-01T15:10:09 <gloob> demo-mainstream needs additional work, anyhow
2017-06-01T15:10:16 <gloob> it\'s more complext to install
2017-06-01T15:10:37 <simonjb> ok, so maybe I\'ll start with https://github.com/GPII/gpii-app/tree/hst-2017
2017-06-01T15:10:55 <simonjb> and if we need demo-mainstream, I\'ll tackle that after
2017-06-01T15:10:58 <jhernandez_> right, demo-mainstream requires additional tweaking on the OS
2017-06-01T15:11:47 <gloob> yup
2017-06-01T15:13:43 <simonjb> thanks all
2017-06-01T15:14:49 * mrtyler joined the channel
2017-06-01T15:17:06 <simonjb> gloob: is the tweaking on the OS for demo-mainstream documented somewhere?
2017-06-01T15:25:40 <gloob> simonjb: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SmalB4eYHA4Db4SydshTgJ1v3kH73HWD6VtW9rnEDfw/edit
