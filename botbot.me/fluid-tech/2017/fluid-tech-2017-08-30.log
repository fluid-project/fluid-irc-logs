2017-08-30T14:24:09 <clown> hey gtirloni, I just did another "ok to test" here:  https://github.com/GPII/windows/pull/82#issuecomment-326006493
2017-08-30T14:24:18 <clown> we\'ll see if it triggers anything.
2017-08-30T14:29:45 <gtirloni> i think i know what\'s happening now, after reading some docs
2017-08-30T14:29:56 <gtirloni> you\'re in the whitelist, so your PRs will trigger builds when they arrive
2017-08-30T14:30:10 <gtirloni> anything after that requires admin access, to control jenkins directly
2017-08-30T14:30:38 <gtirloni> and the gpii reviewers are admins
2017-08-30T14:31:01 * michelled joined the channel
2017-08-30T14:32:27 <gtirloni> so you said \'ok to test\', but there are no news commits in that PR
2017-08-30T14:32:37 <gtirloni> since the last time CI ran
2017-08-30T14:32:45 <gtirloni> if you change anything, it should trigger a new build
2017-08-30T14:36:23 <clown> gtirloni:  I didn\'t change anything here, but ehre is a depedency on changes I made to universal, so I wanted to run the windows tests to see if the universal change cause any problems (https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/355#issuecomment-325996826)
2017-08-30T14:37:45 <gtirloni> make sense, i\'ve okay\'ed it now and i\'ll send a PR reviewing the admin list with more names
2017-08-30T14:38:18 <clown> thanks gtirloni
2017-08-30T14:39:09 <clown> addendum:  for completeness, I\'ll want to run the linux tests as well for the same resaon on pull  58
2017-08-30T14:45:15 <gtirloni> clown: ok, triggered
2017-08-30T14:46:53 <clown> gtirloni:  this is what all your education/training was for:  a clown tapping you on the shoulder and asking you to add an "ok to test" comment.
2017-08-30T14:47:03 <clown> thanks, by the way.
2017-08-30T14:47:20 <gtirloni> my mom would be proud ;)
2017-08-30T14:48:17 <gtirloni> clown: i\'ve added you and some other people to the list of admins, feel free to \'ok to test\' until get tired now :)
2017-08-30T14:48:57 <gtirloni> it should have occurred to me yesterday that this was the case, but i\'ve been burned by jenkins too many times now that i think it\'s just acting out
2017-08-30T14:49:34 <clown> gtirloni, yes, well I thought amatas had added me back in Jun/Jul, and for a while my own "ok to test" comments worked.  Recently they stopped working.
2017-08-30T14:50:36 <gtirloni> i don\'t see that in the ci-service repo, maybe it was a temporary change in the jenkins config... they get overwritten by the ci-service repo whenever there\'s a commit
2017-08-30T14:51:08 <gtirloni> your elevated privileges are forever baked into git now
2017-08-30T14:51:09 <gtirloni> https://github.com/GPII/ci-service/blob/master/jenkins_jobs/macros.yml#L17
2017-08-30T14:51:46 <clown> oh, the power!
