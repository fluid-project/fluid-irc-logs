2017-02-14T12:43:14 <gtirloni> amatas: hi! are you able to connect to idrc\'s servers?
2017-02-14T12:43:36 <gtirloni> my internet seems fine but i can\'t ping ocad\'s gateway anymore.. i was wondering if it\'s an issue with my ISP routing or something else
2017-02-14T12:43:47 <gtirloni> 205.211.169.1
2017-02-14T12:44:05 <amatas> let me check

2017-02-14T12:44:39 <amatas> I\'m in i-0044
2017-02-14T12:44:48 <gtirloni> cool, it must be something on my side then

2017-02-14T12:48:14 <gtirloni> looks like my isp\'s routing is b0rked.. reauthenticated the adsl line, got a new IP.. still no go.
2017-02-14T12:48:30 <gtirloni> time for coffee :)
2017-02-14T12:54:02 <gtirloni> cool, routing is back

2017-02-14T14:56:13 <Bosmon> kasparnet - the one for the gpii-app where all the tests fail
2017-02-14T14:56:21 <Bosmon> jhernandez and michelled were commenting on this
2017-02-14T14:56:26 <kasparnet> ugh - yes, meant gpii-app

2017-02-14T15:12:25 <gtirloni> i think i\'m done spamming everyone in every possible way now

2017-02-14T15:16:03 <kasparnet> Bosmon: in terms of my MM work
2017-02-14T15:16:11 <kasparnet> I\'m working on the integration tests
2017-02-14T15:16:44 <kasparnet> and am hitting some issues with the "get" portion of the launch handler
2017-02-14T15:17:18 <kasparnet> I want the test cases to be able to provice an initial value for those cases
2017-02-14T15:18:08 <kasparnet> ie. the launch handler should report false or true on snapshotting the original settings, instead of `undefined` as it does right now
2017-02-14T15:18:52 <kasparnet> but I have a really hard time getting anything passed to the mockSettingsHandler
2017-02-14T15:20:13 <kasparnet> the "gpii.test.integration.mockSettingsHandler" is unsable to resolve {testCaseHolder} and {tests}
2017-02-14T15:20:15 <kasparnet> Bosmon: ^
2017-02-14T15:49:13 * alanharn_ joined the channel
2017-02-14T15:50:50 <Bosmon> kasparnet - well, it is probably because they are out of scope :)
2017-02-14T15:51:56 <kasparnet> Bosmon: yes, that\'s what I figured -- but I\'m not sure how to possibly get them into scope. It seems the mockSettingsHandler is constructed in a weird way, not being a subcomponent of anything within the normal component tree
2017-02-14T15:52:08 <Bosmon> kasparnet - guess what, Justin_o, jhung and I have been working on a diagram to explain just this issue :)
2017-02-14T15:52:09 <Bosmon> http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/Contexts.html
2017-02-14T15:52:24 <kasparnet> oooooh
2017-02-14T15:55:36 <Bosmon> kasparnet - if you want stuff passed to the mockSettingsHandler you\'ll just have to use the same scheme which everyone else uses
