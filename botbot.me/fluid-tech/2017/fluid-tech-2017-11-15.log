2017-11-15T15:28:03 * grrrero joined the channel
2017-11-15T15:36:50 <gloob> stegru: well, long story, I suggest that for the demo to lower the notification threshold of windows because current implementation of simi use powershell script to actually make the change
2017-11-15T15:37:05 <gloob> stegru: from that, started a conversation about a security hole
2017-11-15T15:37:43 <gloob> stegru: probably we could implement it better, meaning getting rid of powershell initiators
2017-11-15T15:38:15 <gloob> and avoid the notification of windows security notification layer about that gpii is going to launch a ps1 script when key-in with simi
2017-11-15T15:38:17 <stegru> gloob: is it the "administrator" prompt? or the powershell thing?
2017-11-15T15:38:31 <stegru> ok
2017-11-15T15:39:06 <gloob> User Account Control
2017-11-15T15:39:20 <stegru> I\'m (slowly) working on something to work around this
2017-11-15T15:40:05 <gloob> @ste
2017-11-15T15:40:12 <gloob> uops sorry
2017-11-15T15:40:24 <gloob> stegru: for powershell or for UAC?
2017-11-15T15:41:31 <stegru> UAC.. all powershell needs is the -executionpolity argument.. which I can see you\'re using
2017-11-15T15:42:08 <gloob> yes, we are using it, we find that if the UAC setting is not tolerant, it warns the user
2017-11-15T15:42:21 <stegru> i\'m looking at javjarfer[m]\'s 2521 branch
2017-11-15T15:42:24 <stegru> ok
2017-11-15T15:42:50 <stegru> I wish windows had a setuid
2017-11-15T15:43:24 <gloob> that would be great, yes
2017-11-15T15:43:59 <gloob> and notification is silly, if I do the call using other technology you don\'t warn the user, they are just checking classical script kiddies techniques
2017-11-15T15:44:23 <gloob> I don\'t see a security hole, somebody that wants to harm is going to avoid the UAC notification
2017-11-15T15:44:28 <gloob> UAC doesn\'t exists xD

2017-11-15T15:44:47 <gloob> only 15?
2017-11-15T15:44:52 <gloob> :D
2017-11-15T15:44:54 <stegru> hah
2017-11-15T15:44:58 <stegru> it\'s pointless
2017-11-15T15:45:42 <gloob> stegru: yes, think so, but you know how things develop :)
2017-11-15T15:46:14 <gloob> umhhh, that reminds me the cmd.exe technique, but I think UAC is going to warn anyway
2017-11-15T15:46:20 * the-t-in-rtf joined the channel
2017-11-15T15:46:39 <gloob> probably to make the com+ call through edge.js would be best option nowadays
2017-11-15T15:47:23 <gloob> but using ps1 scripts as initiator is an awesome tool for us, I guess
2017-11-15T15:47:44 <stegru> but it will always warn about UAC, because the thing that the script does requires administrator

2017-11-15T15:54:32 <stegru> gloob: I might be able to make a script that reduces the permissions of the registry key that the ps1 script is setting
2017-11-15T15:55:07 <gloob> let\'s try it

2017-11-15T17:44:22 <javjarfer[m]> stegru: it\'s possible to reduce the permissions for accessing something that at first you think the user should be notified if modified, so he doesn\'t receive any notification, and that change in permissions doesn\'t show any notification?
2017-11-15T17:45:42 <stegru> I\'m not sure what you mean, javjarfer[m] - when reducing the permission, you will need to become administrator - so the user will be notified
2017-11-15T17:45:44 <gloob> that\'s what he said
2017-11-15T17:45:49 <stegru> but, that only happens once
2017-11-15T17:46:06 <gloob> but you are tweaking their system
2017-11-15T17:46:09 <javjarfer[m]> stegru: ooh okay, but it will be notified once
2017-11-15T17:46:53 <stegru> or never notified, if you make the installer change the permissions - that\'s running as administrator already
2017-11-15T17:46:57 <javjarfer[m]> that sounds more logical, I didn\'t understand well what you were saying the first time
2017-11-15T17:47:39 <javjarfer[m]> > or never notified, if you make the installer change the permissions - that\'s running as administrator already
2017-11-15T17:47:40 <javjarfer[m]> yes, this may be the best approach for sure
2017-11-15T17:47:46 <stegru> i know reducing the permissions on a registry key isn\'t nice.. but it\'s nicer than removing the UAC prompts
2017-11-15T17:48:19 <stegru> i mean, nicer than disabling UAC
2017-11-15T17:48:53 <javjarfer[m]> > i mean, nicer than disabling UAC
2017-11-15T17:48:54 <javjarfer[m]> yes,  sure, for now it seems like the best thing to do in short term
2017-11-15T17:48:59 <stegru> yeh
2017-11-15T17:57:03 <mrtyler> amatas: colinclark can we schedule the technical exercise for Tuesday 1700-1900 UTC+1?
2017-11-15T17:58:05 <amatas> mrtyler: it works for me
2017-11-15T17:58:29 <mrtyler> cool, thx alf
2017-11-15T17:58:45 <colinclark> Is that 11 am EST?
2017-11-15T17:59:16 <mrtyler> yes
2017-11-15T17:59:27 <colinclark> Unfortunately I\'m booked at that time
2017-11-15T17:59:37 <colinclark> but the noon block is free
2017-11-15T17:59:45 <colinclark> so if you want me to come in towards the end, and it will be more than an hour, i should be fine
2017-11-15T17:59:46 <mrtyler> 1200-1400 est?
2017-11-15T17:59:47 <mrtyler> oh
2017-11-15T17:59:48 <mrtyler> right
2017-11-15T17:59:55 <mrtyler> yeah
2017-11-15T18:00:00 <mrtyler> ok let\'s do that
2017-11-15T18:00:15 <mrtyler> we\'ll start at 1100est, you can show up 1230-1300 or so

2017-11-15T18:23:51 <amatas> ok, nice
2017-11-15T18:24:02 <mrtyler> bonus fact: while "i\'ve" means "i have", you can\'t really use it for "i have to leave"
2017-11-15T18:24:04 * amatas has quit
2017-11-15T18:24:30 <mrtyler> "i\'ve" is for the perfect tense - i\'ve had a long day, i\'ve got to go
2017-11-15T18:24:46 <mrtyler> "have to" is kind of a special construction
2017-11-15T18:24:50 <mrtyler> like "tener que"
2017-11-15T18:25:07 <mrtyler> jfyi ;)
2017-11-15T18:26:04 <mrtyler> (i guess "i\'ve had a long day" is pluperfect, not perfect :))
