2017-03-14T18:54:37 <gtirloni> amatas, i\'ve updated to vbox 5.1.16, vagrant 1.9.2 and win10 box 0.4.7.. used the sample .vagrant.yml from the vagrant-ci plugin.. but i can\'t access c:\\vagrant, it says "the parameter is incorrect"
2017-03-14T18:55:25 <gtirloni> https://www.pastery.net/grkyqy/
2017-03-14T18:56:05 <gtirloni> vagrant-gpii-ci (0.0.6)
2017-03-14T18:56:05 <gtirloni> vagrant-share (1.1.7, system)
2017-03-14T18:58:43 <amatas> thanks gtirloni
2017-03-14T18:59:13 <amatas> I\'m afraid that the shared folders in 5.1.16 are broken for linux hosts and windows guests
2017-03-14T19:00:02 <amatas> I\'m downgrading vbox to 5.1.14 to check if it\'s work fine with the same VM
2017-03-14T19:00:13 <gtirloni> btw, i tested it on a win10
2017-03-14T19:00:19 <gtirloni> should i try on fedora25?
2017-03-14T19:00:29 <amatas> isn\'t necessary
2017-03-14T19:00:40 <gtirloni> ok. it seems i\'m hitting a different issue
2017-03-14T19:00:42 <amatas> also seems to be broken on OSX
2017-03-14T19:00:47 <amatas> but with a different issue
2017-03-14T19:01:47 <amatas> :( this is so disappointing
