2017-08-17T14:25:40 <simonjb> hi cindyli, this morning I was running universal/tests/all-tests.js on your GPII-2435 branch and got a \'segmentation fault\' at "Sending a POST request to: /access_token on port 8081". I reran the tests and all worked so wasn\'t able to reproduce. I was wondering if you had seen that before?
2017-08-17T14:25:46 * grrrero joined the channel
2017-08-17T14:26:33 <cindyli> umm.. don\'t remember seeing it, simonjb
2017-08-17T14:27:03 <cindyli> which test file it fails on, simonjb
2017-08-17T14:32:35 <simonjb> cindyli: looking to see if I can figure out
2017-08-17T14:33:22 <cindyli> simonjb: let me know if you want me to have a look
2017-08-17T14:36:35 <simonjb> cindyli: I believe it\'s tests/platform/cloud/AcceptanceTests_oauth2_gpiiAppInstallation.js
2017-08-17T14:36:49 <simonjb> but I haven\'t been able to reproduce the seg fault
2017-08-17T14:36:56 <simonjb> I only saw it one time
2017-08-17T14:39:49 <cindyli> simonjb: did you see it when running on the local machine or via a VM?
2017-08-17T14:40:01 <simonjb> local
2017-08-17T14:40:04 <simonjb> linux
2017-08-17T14:40:18 <cindyli> cannot reproduce it here too
2017-08-17T14:40:35 <cindyli> ok, let\'s see if it will come up again
2017-08-17T14:48:41 <simonjb> cindyli: I tried to send you a private message but I\'m seeing "You must log in with services to message this user"
2017-08-17T14:49:21 <cindyli> did you pm via irc, simonjb
2017-08-17T14:49:33 <simonjb> yes
2017-08-17T14:49:40 <cindyli> gtirloni: any idea ^
2017-08-17T14:50:19 <simonjb> cindyli: can you try sending me a message?
2017-08-17T14:50:22 <cindyli> simonjb: i got the same msg at private messaging you
2017-08-17T14:50:59 <cindyli> simonjb: we can use gtalk
2017-08-17T14:51:15 <cindyli> ur google account appears offline tho

2017-08-17T15:05:22 <mrtyler> sure
2017-08-17T15:06:34 <mrtyler> gtirloni: you coming?
2017-08-17T15:12:43 <gtirloni> mrtyler: sorry, got stuck in traffic
2017-08-17T15:12:47 <gtirloni> joining
2017-08-17T15:16:47 <simonjb> cindyli: did a git clean and npm install, all-tests.js ran fine so not able to reproduce the seg fault yet. I\'m going to stop investigating for now but let\'s be aware and investigate more if it happens again
2017-08-17T15:17:09 <cindyli> ok. thanks, simonjb

2017-08-17T16:36:46 <gtirloni> cindyli simonjb: looks like the node process died, right?
2017-08-17T16:37:35 <gtirloni> it\'s weird to see a segfault... points to low-level issues in C/C++ code.. but while sending a POST request, even weirder
2017-08-17T16:42:36 <cindyli> ya. that\'s true, let\'s see if it will come up again

2017-08-17T17:09:02 <gtirloni> amatas mrtyler: good news for terraform on azure - https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/hashicorp-marketing/Newsletters/August+2017/index.html  #future
2017-08-17T17:11:08 <simonjb> yeah gtirloni, the node process seg faulted
2017-08-17T17:11:59 <simonjb> I\'m thinking a bug in Node.js itself or in one of the native code projects that we depend on
2017-08-17T17:12:28 <simonjb> but I\'ve not been able to reproduce at this point
2017-08-17T17:13:05 <gtirloni> heisenbugs :(
2017-08-17T17:13:10 <simonjb> :(
2017-08-17T17:13:55 <amatas> https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/microsoft-partnership-announcement-terraform-azure/
2017-08-17T17:14:11 <simonjb> hopefully it\'ll be a non-issue but we should be on the lookout in case it happens again
2017-08-17T17:15:25 <gtirloni> simonjb: is it ubuntu? which node version?
2017-08-17T17:15:53 <simonjb> yes gtirloni, ubuntu and node 6.11.0
2017-08-17T17:16:09 <gtirloni> ok
2017-08-17T17:20:02 * alanharn_ joined the channel
2017-08-17T17:28:13 <amatas> gtirloni: are you in the kubernetes - gitlab CI meeting?
2017-08-17T17:28:21 <gtirloni> amatas: yep
2017-08-17T17:28:41 <amatas> did you know https://github.com/kubernetes/helm ?
2017-08-17T17:29:45 <gtirloni> yep, it\'s pretty cool... but it\'s more complex then messing with k8s manifests. it has dependencies between charts, etc
2017-08-17T17:30:02 <gtirloni> looks like the way to go once we get more comfortable with everything
2017-08-17T17:30:05 <amatas> oh, I see
2017-08-17T17:30:51 <gtirloni> helm.sh
2017-08-17T17:33:24 <gtirloni> warning: weaveworks webinars usually have a lot of marketing stuff.. i\'m waiting for the to show how some of their products will fix what he just described
2017-08-17T17:33:58 <gtirloni> *the presenter
2017-08-17T17:34:11 <mrtyler> i looked at helm and don\'t think we need it until we start using more 3rd party things in k8s
2017-08-17T17:34:13 <amatas> I just realised that
2017-08-17T17:34:31 <mrtyler> tho i guess amatas if you\'re going to get prometheus running you might look at using helm for that
2017-08-17T17:35:21 * alanharn_ has quit
2017-08-17T17:35:22 <gtirloni> two advantages of helm: the dependency management and parameterized deployments
2017-08-17T17:35:25 <amatas> I\'ll take a look,  and see how we can get any advantage of using helm
2017-08-17T17:35:32 * alanharn_ joined the channel
2017-08-17T17:35:40 <amatas> :D for example those two advantages
2017-08-17T17:35:55 <amatas> if I have a good progress with the tasks I will take a look
2017-08-17T17:36:03 <gtirloni> \\o/
2017-08-17T17:37:33 <gtirloni> https://github.com/kubernetes/charts
2017-08-17T17:38:10 <gtirloni> theoretically you just run this: helm install stable/prometheus
2017-08-17T17:39:03 <mrtyler> you should be able to just add helm to \'extra_components\' in deploy.rake :)
2017-08-17T17:39:14 <gtirloni> same as with ansible roles... it might not be the most reliable way of deploying it, needing tweaks, etc.. but the starting point is there
2017-08-17T17:39:16 <mrtyler> analagous to dashboard
2017-08-17T17:39:16 <gtirloni> mrtyler: that\'s nice!
