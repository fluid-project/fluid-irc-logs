2017-04-24T11:32:53 * Bosmon7 joined the channel
2017-04-24T11:34:30 <gtirloni> amatas: when you get a chance, could you trigger one of the vagrant box builds from your gitlab instance so we can check if they are faster now? i\'m playing with some settings on h-0005
2017-04-24T11:34:33 <amatas> hi gtirloni!
2017-04-24T11:34:40 <amatas> sure
2017-04-24T11:35:47 <amatas> https://gitlab.com/amatas/packer-win/builds/14895930
2017-04-24T11:36:05 <amatas> this is the faster build of all
2017-04-24T11:38:12 <gtirloni> hmm i think i configured the wrong folder... can you kill it? i need to configure this for the gitlab-runner user
2017-04-24T11:38:15 <gtirloni> sorry!
2017-04-24T11:38:48 <amatas> in fact gtirloni, could you remove the wrong directory and user. To avoid the confusion.
2017-04-24T11:39:06 <gtirloni> gitlab-ci?
2017-04-24T11:39:37 <amatas> the last week I had to restore some things and I realized that the home directorio of the gitlab-ci is now the gitlab-runner
2017-04-24T11:39:45 <gtirloni> ah ok, will do
2017-04-24T11:39:46 <amatas> mm, yes, the gitlab-ci
2017-04-24T11:40:22 <amatas> I copied and set all up in the gitlab-runner home directory, so I guess that now it\'s safe to remove the old one
2017-04-24T11:42:22 * stegru_ has quit
2017-04-24T11:45:09 <gtirloni> ok, i think this should work now
2017-04-24T11:45:34 <amatas> do I trigger the build again?
2017-04-24T11:46:30 <gtirloni> yes, please
2017-04-24T11:46:41 <amatas> https://gitlab.com/amatas/packer-win/builds/14896553
2017-04-24T11:46:52 <gtirloni> thanks!
2017-04-24T11:46:59 <amatas> what changes are you trying?
2017-04-24T11:47:08 <gtirloni> ramdisk :D :D :D
2017-04-24T11:47:15 <amatas> OH
2017-04-24T11:47:46 <gtirloni> i figured we have 144GB of ram on that box, it might be good to use it for temporary directories that we don\'t care much about
2017-04-24T11:48:56 <amatas> nice, the bad part is that by default the max size of the vm disks is 60gb, which is filled by 0s before it is compressed at the last step of the build
2017-04-24T11:49:13 <gtirloni> i don\'t know if it\'s really going to help because when packer/vbox was running really slow to create the boxes, we saw that it was barely doing any disk activity.. so let\'s see
2017-04-24T11:49:50 <gtirloni> oh i see.. that might be a problem (i created a 64GB ramdisk, we could still go up to 128GB just fine but it\'s not enough for >2 boxes building at the same time)
2017-04-24T11:50:11 <amatas> mm, yes, I think that the most time consuming task is the downloading and installing of the updates
2017-04-24T11:51:05 <amatas> sometimes the microsoft servers perform better than others
2017-04-24T11:51:46 <amatas> I\'ve also tried to bulid an installation iso with all the updates inside, but it causes BSODs at the installation.
2017-04-24T11:53:05 <gtirloni> :(
2017-04-24T11:53:32 <gtirloni> looks like speeding this thing up won\'t be as easy as i thought
2017-04-24T11:55:30 <amatas> well, there were some changes that increased the performance, like multiple processors, IO host cache,...
2017-04-24T11:57:14 <amatas> perhaps using a NVMe controller as disk could increase even more the IO, but it isn\'t sopported by default for all the windows vms: https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch05.html#harddiskcontrollers
2017-04-24T11:57:33 <amatas> as hard disk controller*
2017-04-24T11:57:58 <gtirloni> yeah, looks like we\'ve tried everything
2017-04-24T11:58:29 <amatas> yup :(
2017-04-24T11:58:56 <gtirloni> does it usually takes this long to boot the VM? it seems stuck
2017-04-24T11:59:43 <amatas> yes, because, it installs all the updates before it installs the SSH
2017-04-24T12:00:03 <amatas> this is the step that takes more time
2017-04-24T12:00:39 <amatas> if you watch the VM window you\'ll see a CMD windows and installing all the windows 10 updates
2017-04-24T12:01:14 <gtirloni> got it. ok, if it works.. it works... but the 60gb disk is going to be a problem. let\'s call this an experiment :) i can revert the changes then
2017-04-24T12:01:28 <amatas> ok
2017-04-24T12:02:00 <amatas> usually I trigger the builds by friday to have them all on monday :D
2017-04-24T12:02:04 <gtirloni> lol

2017-04-24T15:14:08 <gtirloni> colinclark: i\'m free after 1pm Eastern
2017-04-24T15:14:40 <colinclark> ok, i\'m in a bit of a crunch with prep for the EC review today
2017-04-24T15:14:55 <colinclark> but shall we do 1 pm EDT, gtirloni?
2017-04-24T15:15:05 <gtirloni> that works for me
2017-04-24T15:15:13 <mrtyler> we have a meeting at 1300 EST

2017-04-24T15:15:38 <mrtyler> devops weekly
2017-04-24T15:16:18 <gtirloni> i\'m confused about that. i thought that was deprecated in favor of the "every 3 weeks" meeting that Sandra setup
2017-04-24T15:16:29 <mrtyler> no, every 3 weeks is planning
2017-04-24T15:16:34 <mrtyler> we still have the regular weekly meeting
2017-04-24T15:16:43 <mrtyler> it\'s still on my calendar
2017-04-24T15:16:46 <colinclark> I guess we have our first agenda item, then :)
2017-04-24T15:16:49 <colinclark> talk to you at 1 pm
2017-04-24T15:17:30 <gtirloni> ok
