2017-11-30T16:20:36 <mrtyler> amatas: separate question for you
2017-11-30T16:21:03 <mrtyler> yesterday we talked about COUCHDB_PASSWORD being unstable / non idempotent
2017-11-30T16:21:15 <mrtyler> i hacked the rakefile to just use a static password instead for now
2017-11-30T16:21:30 <mrtyler> but if i\'m reading this correctly, the couchdb password is only set during initial cluster creation
2017-11-30T16:21:35 <mrtyler> which is probably how it has to be
2017-11-30T16:21:55 <mrtyler> how do we recover from this situation, where existing couchdb clusters have an old password set that we no longer have?
2017-11-30T16:22:14 <mrtyler> i think we need to destroy the couchdb volumes and start over
2017-11-30T16:22:29 <mrtyler> am i missing a simpler / less disruptive solution?
2017-11-30T16:22:55 <amatas_> the problem raises when we use an already created database with an old password
2017-11-30T16:23:31 <amatas_> and we spin up a new cluster on top of that data
2017-11-30T16:24:51 <amatas_> perhaps the couchdb credentials should be a string based on the environment. Perhaps for a dev environment the password could be random generated, but in the case of stg,prd we should set a fixed secret
2017-11-30T16:27:33 <amatas_> mrtyler: perhaps this could be a task for our Vault cluster?
2017-11-30T16:28:15 <mrtyler> vault likely helps with this in the future
2017-11-30T16:29:39 <mrtyler> the problem isn\'t how the password is generated
2017-11-30T16:29:54 <mrtyler> the immediate problem is that the generated passwords *changes* from run to run
2017-11-30T16:30:07 <mrtyler> actually that\'s the underlying problem
2017-11-30T16:30:21 <mrtyler> the immediate problem is we have couchdbs running in various enviornments for which we no longer have the passwords
2017-11-30T16:30:33 <mrtyler> i want to recover from the immediate problem first
2017-11-30T16:30:46 <mrtyler> then we can talk about the underlying problem
2017-11-30T16:43:38 <mrtyler> amatas_: any ideas? otherwise i\'ll destroy a bunch of stuff today i guess :)
2017-11-30T16:44:18 <amatas_> well, the passwords are stored at env variables
2017-11-30T16:44:45 <amatas_> you can recover them from the env variables of the dataloader job, for example
2017-11-30T16:45:58 <amatas_> I\'m still thinking on how to solve this problem
2017-11-30T16:46:09 <mrtyler> i was going to say that the original env vars are gone, having been replaced upon the next deploy
2017-11-30T16:46:21 <mrtyler> but since dataloader job can\'t be reconfigured, it may still have the old tokens
2017-11-30T16:46:28 <amatas_> :\'(
2017-11-30T16:46:30 <mrtyler> however, let\'s say i get the old password for the stg couchdb
2017-11-30T16:46:44 <mrtyler> then what do i do? hardcode the password for each environment in the manifests?
2017-11-30T16:46:58 <mrtyler> manually update the old password to some new password for each existing couchdb cluster?
2017-11-30T16:48:17 <mrtyler> did you get a chance to look at any of this today?
2017-11-30T16:48:23 <amatas_> only to have it clear, all those variables are public, aren\'t they?
2017-11-30T16:48:36 <amatas_> I\'m on this right now
2017-11-30T16:48:41 <mrtyler> what do you mean by "public"?
2017-11-30T16:48:45 <amatas_> git repository
2017-11-30T16:48:49 <amatas_> github
2017-11-30T16:48:56 <mrtyler> the generated passwords are not in git since they are generated, ofc
2017-11-30T16:49:04 <mrtyler> my current hack is to hardcode them into git, yes
2017-11-30T16:49:37 <mrtyler> i believe the only alternative we discussed was disabling the password entirely, which is fine but not better than a hardcoded password in a git repo :)
2017-11-30T16:50:42 <amatas_> disable passwords will put couchdb in "admin party mode" with is not good
2017-11-30T16:52:21 * avtar joined the channel
2017-11-30T16:52:28 <amatas_> mrtyler: I\'m thinking on storing those kind of strings in a vault file, which uses a string to decript the data. That string can be configured in the CI to avoid to be exposed to the public
2017-11-30T16:54:57 <mrtyler> amatas_: let\'s focus on the immediate problem
2017-11-30T16:55:26 <mrtyler> also integrating with vault seems very out of scope to me right now
2017-11-30T16:58:50 <amatas_> mrtyler: I think I have a possible simple solution for prd and stg and all the deployments made by the CI
2017-11-30T16:59:03 <mrtyler> great
2017-11-30T16:59:51 <amatas_> the main idea is to avoid the use of a random password if a environment variable with the password exists
2017-11-30T17:00:29 <mrtyler> additional note: this conversation may be somewhat academic, as i think i need to destroy and re-create all the couchdb volumes *anyway* to do GPII-2718
2017-11-30T17:00:29 <amatas_> the env variable can be set by us at our terminal for our own deployments, and in the case of the CI it can be set at the CI config
2017-11-30T17:01:10 <mrtyler> so i have to remember to set COUCHDB_PASSWORD before i run rake? or what?
2017-11-30T17:01:12 <amatas_> yes, sorry, if the password was changed, the only way to proceed is to destroy the volume
2017-11-30T17:01:23 <mrtyler> ok, i will plan to do that today
2017-11-30T17:01:34 <mrtyler> unless you would like to
2017-11-30T17:01:48 <mrtyler> actually never mind, i\'ll do it with the other work. makes more sense that way
2017-11-30T17:02:55 * clown joined the channel
2017-11-30T17:03:37 <amatas_> mrtyler: yes, if you want to use a particular couchdb password you must set the env variable first
2017-11-30T17:03:50 <mrtyler> i don\'t like it
2017-11-30T17:04:44 <amatas_> do you feel more confortable if we read the password from a file that is not part of the git repository?
2017-11-30T17:05:07 <mrtyler> hmm
2017-11-30T17:05:17 <mrtyler> i want the system to be automatic for all users
2017-11-30T17:05:28 <mrtyler> i.e. i like the idea of generated passwords
2017-11-30T17:05:38 <mrtyler> we just need to... not overwrite them somehow
2017-11-30T17:05:47 <mrtyler> which may not really be possible with the current setup
2017-11-30T17:05:48 <amatas_> the system will still generating random passwords if the previous conditions don\'t met
2017-11-30T17:06:02 <mrtyler> then how does this solve the current problem?
2017-11-30T17:06:28 <amatas_> I mean the password could be set in that order: file in filesystem, env variable, random string
2017-11-30T17:06:48 <amatas_> the file in filesystem can be useful for the development machine, where you have your particular password
2017-11-30T17:07:12 <amatas_> the env variable is useful for the CI where the password is in the configuration of the repository (CI section)
2017-11-30T17:07:50 <ussjoin> Vault could indeed handle this--and it\'s ready for use.
2017-11-30T17:07:50 <amatas_> and the random password in the rest of scenarios where the data in the cluster doesn\'t matters
2017-11-30T17:08:13 <ussjoin> ANd you don\'t have to decrypt stuff in Vault, if that\'s what you meant (I was confused from your comments above, amatas_).

2017-11-30T17:09:00 <amatas_> ussjoin: I meant a vault file, is an encripted file with plain strings in it.
2017-11-30T17:09:28 <ussjoin> Gotcha. But then you have the key distribution problem again. :-)
2017-11-30T17:09:45 <amatas_> ussjoin: like the ansible-vault
2017-11-30T17:10:04 <amatas_> but the key is a secret that we have in our private machines
2017-11-30T17:10:14 <amatas_> and only in the CI
2017-11-30T17:10:24 <ussjoin> I see. So again, though, we have a solution for this ready to go for anything in AWS.
2017-11-30T17:12:09 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-11-30T17:12:22 <ussjoin> And then you wouldn\'t have to deal with key distribution; once you have the Vault token, a curl (or any of umpteen client libraries, or the vault cli tool) will get you what you need.
2017-11-30T17:14:23 <ussjoin> One can also do an encrypted blob stored on the machine and then use KMS to decrypt (and lock the KMS key to an IAM instance profile). That\'s what I did to bootstrap Vault (since you can\'t store Vault\'s launch secrets in Vault without a YoDawg-compliant deployment strategy). It\'s just harder, and easier to have obnoxious errors to debug.

2017-11-30T22:21:30 <alanharnum> it is a bit uncanny

2017-11-30T22:29:02 <alanharnum> I can definitely see a lot of potential AT applications for this. and scary surveillance things.
