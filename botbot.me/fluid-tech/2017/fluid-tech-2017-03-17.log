2017-03-17T13:23:55 <stegru> jhernandez: did you only test the installer on your vm? I'm thinking it may have not worked because you have the UAC disabled
2017-03-17T13:25:32 <jhernandez> stegru: hmmm
2017-03-17T13:25:56 <jhernandez> yes, I tested it on my vm
2017-03-17T13:26:17 <jhernandez> do you want the msi?
2017-03-17T13:26:21 <stegru> sure
2017-03-17T13:26:38 <stegru> it's worth a quick try
2017-03-17T13:27:21 <jhernandez> ok, let me upload it somewhere

2017-03-17T15:10:01 <amatas> mrtyler, let me see the latest changes
2017-03-17T15:10:30 <mrtyler> cool, lmk if you have a problem
2017-03-17T15:10:38 <mrtyler> do you have access to the idrc amazon account?
2017-03-17T15:10:45 <mrtyler> if so you could do an end-to-end test for me
2017-03-17T15:10:49 <mrtyler> if not i'll have to wait for gioi
2017-03-17T15:11:36 <amatas> no, sorry
2017-03-17T15:13:05 <mrtyler> k np
2017-03-17T15:13:52 <mrtyler> oh i forgot i have access to the rtf amazon account. i guess i should e2e test with that account/domain
2017-03-17T15:14:45 <amatas> the rtf amazon account has the route53 which has the gpii.[net|org] DNS db
2017-03-17T15:17:46 <amatas> mrtyler, seems good to me. If it needs any change in the future we'll tackle them then
2017-03-17T15:18:13 <mrtyler> amatas: great, thanks. can you add that to the PR so i can merge it later?
2017-03-17T15:18:30 <amatas> sure
2017-03-17T15:18:39 <mrtyler> thx
2017-03-17T15:18:49 <mrtyler> then i'll really be done with this ansible adventure
2017-03-17T15:19:44 <amatas> good job

2017-03-17T17:42:31 <mrtyler> amatas: you're not still here are you?
2017-03-17T17:42:49 <mrtyler> i forgot that my rtf IAM doesn't have permissions to, like, do anything :\\
2017-03-17T17:43:07 <amatas> I'll be here for some minutes mor
2017-03-17T17:43:09 <amatas> let me check
2017-03-17T17:43:12 <mrtyler> oh sweet
2017-03-17T17:43:13 <mrtyler> thx
2017-03-17T17:43:13 <amatas> more*
2017-03-17T17:43:24 <mrtyler> We encountered the following errors while processing your request:
2017-03-17T17:43:24 <mrtyler> User: arn:aws:iam::478785806711:user/TylerRoscoe is not authorized to perform: iam:GetAccountSummary
2017-03-17T17:43:27 <mrtyler> User: arn:aws:iam::478785806711:user/TylerRoscoe is not authorized to perform: iam:ListAccountAliases
2017-03-17T17:44:47 <mrtyler> so i guess either you can fix that, or if it's easier right now just give me an access key/secret key pair for the rtf aws account
2017-03-17T17:44:56 <mrtyler> drop them on i40 or something
2017-03-17T17:45:22 <amatas> mmm, we're all in the same group
2017-03-17T17:45:54 <amatas> AmazonRoute53DomainsFullAccess AmazonRoute53FullAccess
2017-03-17T17:46:04 <amatas> those are the permissions that we have
2017-03-17T17:46:06 <mrtyler> right i need IAM access
2017-03-17T17:46:13 <mrtyler> oh uh
2017-03-17T17:46:23 <mrtyler> i guess those permissions are ok for now
2017-03-17T17:46:37 <mrtyler> tell you what, can you get me the root account info? i'm going to need it anyway
2017-03-17T17:46:51 <amatas> I've successfully managed the DNS entries using boto
2017-03-17T17:46:56 <amatas> with those permissions
2017-03-17T17:47:09 <mrtyler> right but how do i get credentials?
2017-03-17T17:47:21 <mrtyler> i'm supposed to get them from the IAM dashboard but i can't use it afaict
2017-03-17T17:49:44 <mrtyler> https://aws.amazon.com/developers/access-keys/
2017-03-17T17:49:53 <amatas> mrtyler, try to login in the IAM
2017-03-17T17:49:55 <mrtyler> maybe the admin user has to do that
2017-03-17T17:50:06 <mrtyler> i'm logged in now. do you want me to log out and log back in?
2017-03-17T17:50:10 <amatas> I've added some additional permissions to you
2017-03-17T17:50:17 <mrtyler> k i'll log out
2017-03-17T17:50:23 <amatas> I don't know if it's necessary
2017-03-17T17:50:41 <amatas> but you should now be able to see and manage your API credentials
2017-03-17T17:50:45 <mrtyler> ok i can see way more stuff now
2017-03-17T17:50:59 <amatas> I've to leave
2017-03-17T17:51:06 <mrtyler> yeah that looks good
2017-03-17T17:51:08 <mrtyler> thanks!
2017-03-17T17:51:10 <amatas> yw
2017-03-17T17:51:11 <mrtyler> have a good weekend
2017-03-17T17:51:14 <amatas> thanks!
2017-03-17T17:55:28 <mrtyler> aws route53 list-hosted-zones works and i manually created a dns record earlier so i think i'm all set :)
