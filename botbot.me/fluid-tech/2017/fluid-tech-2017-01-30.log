2017-01-30T14:55:56 <amatas> I\'m available as well
2017-01-30T14:57:02 <avtar> oops, forgot to ping mrtyler
2017-01-30T14:57:50 <mrtyler> hi what?
2017-01-30T14:58:03 <mrtyler> also my meeting link 404s again.i feeel like this happened last week too?
2017-01-30T14:58:11 <mrtyler> can i have a link plz?
2017-01-30T14:59:17 <avtar> i think we were using gio\'s room url last week?
2017-01-30T14:59:57 <avtar> he\'s away until afternoon today so we can use my room
2017-01-30T14:59:58 <avtar> one sec
2017-01-30T15:00:35 <amatas> I\'m trying to boot the vidyo client
2017-01-30T15:00:52 <mrtyler> ko thx
2017-01-30T15:00:54 <avtar> alanharnum, amatas, gloob, mrtyler: https://conf.inclusivedesign.ca/flex.html?roomdirect.html&key=f0Un54C2ZX3xdOq3mntba7B069k
2017-01-30T15:00:59 <mrtyler> that sounds familiar about using gio\'s room
2017-01-30T15:01:48 <avtar> it\'s probably 404ing because gio generated a new key after the last meeting
2017-01-30T15:02:04 <avtar> most of us do that

2017-01-30T15:45:32 <alanharnum> digging around a bit for tools for Ansible testing, I found this, which I was not familiar with: http://molecule.readthedocs.io/en/stable-1.19/
2017-01-30T15:45:44 <alanharnum> it looks quite interesting and under fairly active development
2017-01-30T15:47:08 <alanharnum> amatas avtar mrtyler in particular ^
2017-01-30T15:57:11 <javjarfer> avtar, sorry see late the comment in chat, definitely better than expected at first look!

2017-01-30T20:00:28 <colinclark> avtar: This will seem like deja vu\xe2\x80\x94and it is\xe2\x80\x94but I\'m forgetful and wondering if you can remind me where the best place is to learn how to get started with the headed Linux version of the QI?
2017-01-30T20:04:40 <avtar> colinclark: i don\'t think it\'s deja vu, up till now i\'ve mainly focused on the headless version in terms of documentation https://github.com/GPII/qi-development-environments/tree/master/nodejs
2017-01-30T20:06:40 <colinclark> should i just follow along with what the GPII linux repo does, then, avtar?
2017-01-30T20:07:02 <avtar> yes, the gpii/linux one
2017-01-30T20:07:08 <colinclark> I am testing a dual Node.js/Browser-based application
2017-01-30T20:07:25 <colinclark> which runs all its tests via a single call to "npm test"
2017-01-30T20:10:07 <avtar> gotcha
2017-01-30T20:10:46 <avtar> that sounds fairly straightforward compared to what the gpii fedora vm does
