2017-10-23T14:41:44 <simonjb> good morning cindyli, I\'m going through your changes for GPII-2538 and wondering why the rename from "gpii-auth" to "auth" https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/558/files#diff-f5676849a605d323b71aa44504e044ce
2017-10-23T14:48:44 <cindyli> simonjb: it\'s just to match the database name "preferences" used by saving prefs data. we\'ve been using "auth" from the very beginning at switching from in memory data store to couchdb. i forgot to update this readme at submitting the very first couchdb switch pull request.
2017-10-23T14:49:28 <simonjb> ok, got it cindyli
2017-10-23T14:50:42 <simonjb> cindyli: I think I prefer the "gpii-" prefix as "auth" is a very general name, and could potentially be a couchdb internal database
2017-10-23T14:51:17 <simonjb> but if we have always been using "auth" and this change is simply updating the README, then that\'s fine
2017-10-23T14:51:59 <simonjb> sounds like going forward we will be merging the auth and preferences databases anyway
2017-10-23T14:52:57 <cindyli> ya, at then we can figure out how to name the new database, simonjb
2017-10-23T15:10:29 <cindyli> simonjb: thanks for the review comments on GPII-2538. all has been addressed
2017-10-23T15:10:53 <simonjb> great, thanks cindyli
