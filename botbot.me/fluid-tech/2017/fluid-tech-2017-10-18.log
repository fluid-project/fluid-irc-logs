2017-10-18T17:52:07 <gloob> ussjoin: You can use matrix.org and riot to have a similar experience to slack, if in the future there is enough traction could be an alternative to slack, specially because you can control the traffic, that\'s something I don\'t like from slack
2017-10-18T17:52:21 <gloob> I use that setup actually
2017-10-18T17:52:48 <ussjoin> gloob: The maintenance burden is an issue, among others.
2017-10-18T17:53:16 <gloob> ussjoin: for the organization you mean
2017-10-18T17:53:33 <gloob> well, yes, it is the price to don\'t have the data in computers of other people
2017-10-18T17:53:57 <ussjoin> What data are you concerned about being in the computers of other people?
2017-10-18T17:54:15 <gloob> my full work conversations
2017-10-18T17:54:23 <ussjoin> Gotcha. That\'s already in the computers of other people.
2017-10-18T17:54:33 <gloob> that I\'m not aware of anything but I\'m a bit nitpicking with others parsing it
2017-10-18T17:54:51 <gloob> yes, well, same for irc
2017-10-18T17:55:00 <ussjoin> https://botbot.me/freenode/fluid-tech/ is one, but also several members use web-based loggers that log elsewhere.
2017-10-18T17:55:04 <gloob> anyhow, with riot and matrix.org you have interesting goodies
2017-10-18T17:55:07 <gloob> notifications
2017-10-18T17:55:07 <gloob> etc....
2017-10-18T17:55:36 <ussjoin> I guess I\'m confused why we would pay a permanent maintenance cost, and still be hosting our data in "other peoples\' computers," when AFAICT we don\'t have much gain from doing so.
2017-10-18T17:55:40 <gloob> yes, but if you want to use slack I guess it\'s a bet for all the "groups" conversation
2017-10-18T17:55:42 <gloob> that is great
2017-10-18T17:55:44 <gloob> I hate skype
2017-10-18T17:56:04 <gloob> I hate skype so much
2017-10-18T17:56:21 <gloob> hard to change anyway
2017-10-18T17:56:36 <ussjoin> Heh. So say we all, but that\'s orthogonal somewhat. (Although with a paid plan, we could actually do in-Slack calls of up to 15 people, so that\'s neat. And paid in this case means, for us, not-paid.)
2017-10-18T17:57:51 <ussjoin> I think the move from Skype probably needs to be to Hangouts, but that\'s a longer, and in any case separate, discussion.
2017-10-18T17:58:19 <ussjoin> (Though for short ad-hoc calls, in-Slack calling works nicely enough, probably at least as well as Skype.)
2017-10-18T17:59:37 <ussjoin> (Although I haven\'t tried it from mobile clients; perhaps I should do that before I swear to that. :-) )
2017-10-18T18:06:29 <gloob> yeah, but at then end you have several communication tools, for technical conversation irc is a good backend, you can connect with differents clients and because could be see as just text is really accessible
2017-10-18T18:07:25 * gloob uploaded an image: image.png (222KB) <https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/v1/download/matrix.org/lIwsqqBWLiEYifjXMVjvILlT>
2017-10-18T18:07:33 <gloob> how do you see that?
2017-10-18T18:07:40 <gloob> I don\'t know how this send images
2017-10-18T18:07:51 <ussjoin> I got a link to your matrix.org post.
2017-10-18T18:08:21 <gloob> nice
2017-10-18T18:08:22 <ussjoin> So I can see the thing you mean.
2017-10-18T18:09:36 <ussjoin> I\'m not sure what the advantage of the kind of decentralization of Matrix is, to be honest. I\'m reminded of Moxie\'s excellent post: https://signal.org/blog/the-ecosystem-is-moving/
