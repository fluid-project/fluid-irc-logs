2017-08-10T15:46:30 <cindyli> colinclark: we\'ll have a meeting tomorrow with UX team to review the possible workflows to request and manage client credentials - https://wiki.gpii.net/w/Workflows_to_Request_and_Manage_Client_Credentials. One concern Greg brought up a couple of weeks ago was, he hopes to automate this process without requiring the installing person to login to a central website to request client credentials. I did some research afterwards and found
2017-08-10T15:46:30 <cindyli> a spec of dynamic client registration: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7591. jhernandez, simonjb, stegru and I had some discussions last week about the possibility of using it to automate the process, but we haven\'t reached a satisfied method. our notes of the discussion in case you are interested - https://pad.gpii.net/p/simplify-requesting-client-credentials-f1154nkr
2017-08-10T15:46:48 <cindyli> in this case, do you think if we should continue to have meeting with the UX team tomorrow?
2017-08-10T15:47:09 <cindyli> or we reschedule the meeting until we figure out if it\'s possible to automate the process?
2017-08-10T15:48:19 <stegru> oh
2017-08-10T15:48:35 <stegru> i thought we did come up with something, cindyli
2017-08-10T15:48:57 <stegru> "we" as in you other 3, and i just wasn\'t aware of it
2017-08-10T15:49:41 <cindyli> stegru: we thought the best approach was to "Distribute the initial access token via a non-public channel, such as via a website that must be logged into"
2017-08-10T15:49:50 <stegru> ah ok
2017-08-10T15:50:03 <cindyli> which doesn\'t help with the automation at all
2017-08-10T15:50:12 <stegru> and "the best" != "satisfactory"
2017-08-10T15:50:56 <cindyli> simonjb and i had some more discussions the next day, revisiting the ideas, and we listed some options:
2017-08-10T15:51:03 <cindyli> 1. no initial access token: gives us no control over giving out of client credentials
2017-08-10T15:51:03 <cindyli> 2. non-secret initial access token: enable us to revoke it but not limit who can use it
2017-08-10T15:51:03 <cindyli> 3. gate access to the initial access token behind an account login (number 4 above "Distribute the initial access token via a non-public channel, such as via a website that must be logged into")
2017-08-10T15:51:03 <cindyli> 4. find out if it\'s possible to securely bind initial access tokens with GPII installers
2017-08-10T15:52:01 <cindyli> i think we should rule out each of those and come up with a consensus
2017-08-10T15:52:19 <stegru> well, i had another idea.. but i thought a good solution was already picked (and i just didn\'t know about it)
2017-08-10T15:52:38 <stegru> forgot it
2017-08-10T15:53:15 <cindyli> i probably forgot it too ;) what\'s the other idea?
2017-08-10T15:53:24 <stegru> i forgot it
2017-08-10T15:53:38 <cindyli> haha no
2017-08-10T15:53:48 <stegru> oh,
2017-08-10T15:54:50 <stegru> not really an idea, but something.. create a small installer exe which is dynamic (embed the secret code into it).. this then downloads and runs the normal installer (static)
2017-08-10T15:55:38 <mrtyler> how do you protect the small installer exe?
2017-08-10T15:55:51 <stegru> it\'s one of those where you think "yes! only 50k download", then it downloads an elephant
2017-08-10T15:56:13 <stegru> you can\'t
2017-08-10T15:56:29 <stegru> protect against what?
2017-08-10T15:56:51 * alanharnum joined the channel
2017-08-10T15:57:28 <cindyli> stegru: protect against someone use a debugging tool to open the small installer exe and read the secret form it
2017-08-10T15:57:34 <cindyli> from
2017-08-10T15:57:40 <stegru> oh yes
2017-08-10T15:57:47 <mrtyler> if i have the small intstaller exe, don\'t i now have access to the secret we were trying to protect?
2017-08-10T15:58:03 <stegru> yeh well, that\'s life
2017-08-10T15:58:11 <amatas> :D
2017-08-10T15:59:11 <stegru> encrypt key on the cloud, user downloads, sends enrypted blob, cloud decrypts
2017-08-10T15:59:45 <stegru> oh but it can be replayed.. the blob becomes the secret key.
2017-08-10T15:59:52 <cindyli> exactly
2017-08-10T16:00:43 <stegru> but ignoring that little problem, it solves your original question of "can we inject something into an installer"
2017-08-10T16:00:46 <stegru> :)
2017-08-10T16:01:03 <stegru> i remember why i forgot that idea now
2017-08-10T16:01:56 <cindyli> right, although I was hoping to inject a code into an installer and be able to secure that code

2017-08-10T16:29:00 <colinclark> I\'ll read up this afternoon and share any thoughts that occur to me
2017-08-10T16:29:03 <colinclark> sorry for the delay
2017-08-10T16:29:12 <cindyli> no problem. thanks, colinclark
