2017-09-07T17:19:28 <simonjb> cindyli: I was thinking of having a go at doing some entity modelling for the evolving KeyToken discussion -- did you start this already? if not, would it be useful?
2017-09-07T17:27:00 <cindyli> simonjb: no, i didn\'t start the data modelling.
2017-09-07T17:30:59 <cindyli> i believe it would be useful

2017-09-07T18:14:44 <simonjb> ok cindyli, I will make a start -- do you have a preference for where? google docs or wiki maybe?
2017-09-07T18:15:19 <cindyli> simonjb: wiki might be more open
2017-09-07T18:15:33 <cindyli> but i\'m fine with either
2017-09-07T18:15:41 <simonjb> I like the wiki also cindyli
2017-09-07T18:15:52 <cindyli> nice

2017-09-07T18:48:00 <simonjb> cindyli: https://wiki.gpii.net/w/Keys_and_KeyTokens
2017-09-07T18:48:09 <simonjb> It\'s a start anyway
2017-09-07T18:51:16 <simonjb> cindyli: it\'s a summary at the moment but I see us: (1) making it more formal, (2) adding examples
2017-09-07T18:51:58 <simonjb> and adding pictures once the structure gets a little clearer
2017-09-07T18:51:59 <cindyli> thanks, simonjb. it looks gerat
2017-09-07T18:54:02 <cindyli> for "Privacy Policy", shall the left hand side of mapping be "Solution Id and key"
2017-09-07T18:55:27 <simonjb> so we can have different policies for the same preference safe? differing by which Key is used?
2017-09-07T18:58:14 <simonjb> cindyli: I renamed the page https://wiki.gpii.net/w/Keys,_KeyTokens,_and_Preferences
2017-09-07T19:01:26 <cindyli> simonjb: as multiple keys can point to one prefs safe/set, it doesn\'t make sense to differ by keys, it might make more sense to differ by prefs safe/set
2017-09-07T19:01:41 <ussjoin> What are you including as the privacy policy?
2017-09-07T19:02:29 <cindyli> the privacy policy is for users to define what preferences are allowed to be applied to what solutions, ussjoin
2017-09-07T19:02:54 <ussjoin> cindyli: Ah, gotcha. Is that a new term within GPII, or is that the standard?
2017-09-07T19:02:58 <cindyli> simonjb: it depends on how we\'d like to set up the privacy policy
2017-09-07T19:03:10 <ussjoin> (I don\'t recall there being a name for that feature in what I read, though I recall the feature.)
2017-09-07T19:04:01 <ussjoin> Issue being merely that "privacy policy" is a reserved word under (handwave) a huge number of different sets of regulations, so if we could call it $notthat, that would be neat. If that ship has sailed, I\'ll get out of the way and paper over it later. :-)
2017-09-07T19:04:02 <cindyli> ussjoin: we\'ve been using this term for privacy filtering process, but not sure if it\'s a GPII defined term
2017-09-07T19:04:30 <cindyli> i see, need a different name
2017-09-07T19:04:51 <ussjoin> Only if it\'s not too late, and you and simonjb can be the full judges of that. If it\'s too late, ignore me. :-)
2017-09-07T19:05:13 <simonjb> ussjoin: I\'m pro picking non-confusing names
2017-09-07T19:06:30 <simonjb> I\'ve added a "Questions" sections and will add note on your suggestion to use a different name for "Privacy Policy"
2017-09-07T19:06:32 <cindyli> don\'t think it\'s too late
2017-09-07T19:06:59 <simonjb> cindyli: could you write up your question regarding "Solution Id and key"?
2017-09-07T19:07:09 <cindyli> simonjb: in the wiki?
2017-09-07T19:07:24 <cindyli> or here
2017-09-07T19:07:28 <simonjb> yeah, I added a "Questions" section to the bottom of the page
2017-09-07T19:07:33 <simonjb> wiki
2017-09-07T19:08:00 <cindyli> ok
2017-09-07T19:08:25 * the-t-in-rtf has quit
2017-09-07T19:08:48 <cindyli> ussjoin: is "privacy profile" a confusing name too?
2017-09-07T19:09:12 <ussjoin> cindyli: Not AFAIK; I think that would be a fine way to go. Thank you!
2017-09-07T19:09:22 <cindyli> ok. thanks
2017-09-07T19:09:22 <simonjb> ok, that\'s easy
2017-09-07T19:09:58 <ussjoin> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_policy -- Wiki is surprisingly helpful on this, starts to point to *all* the things that refer to "privacy policy" as having a very specific meaning. If you\'re curious (no need to be).
2017-09-07T19:10:21 <simonjb> I\'ve switched the name to Privacy Profile
2017-09-07T19:27:07 <cindyli> simonjb: i\'ve added my question
2017-09-07T19:31:54 <simonjb> thanks cindyli, though now I understand your question better and I think this model already follows what you are thinking as the Privacy Profile is within the Preference Safe
2017-09-07T19:32:36 <cindyli> ok
2017-09-07T19:32:53 <simonjb> so each Preference Safe has its own Privacy Profile
2017-09-07T19:32:59 <simonjb> is that what you were thinking?
2017-09-07T19:33:57 <cindyli> yes
2017-09-07T19:36:07 <cindyli> simonjb: do you think in the "privacy profile" section to add a bullet point that "privacy profile is defined within the preference safe"
2017-09-07T19:36:40 <cindyli> nvm, it\'s already in "preference safe" section. missed that, sorry
2017-09-07T19:37:44 <simonjb> cindyli: it\'s a good question, a diagram might be the easier way to see the 2-way relationships (rather than just single direction as I have at the moment)
2017-09-07T19:38:28 <cindyli> simonjb: let\'s not spend too much time before the meeting. things might change at the meeting :)
2017-09-07T19:38:37 <simonjb> yeah, agreed

2017-09-07T20:14:27 <simonjb> I think "GPII Token" is now "GPII Key" -- does that seem right to you?
2017-09-07T20:15:25 <cindyli> yes, seems right, simonjb
