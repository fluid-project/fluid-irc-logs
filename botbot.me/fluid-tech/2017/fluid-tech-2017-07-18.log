2017-07-18T13:29:41 <gtirloni> amatas: hi! is there a way to start a fedora box in headless mode using the vagrant plugin?
2017-07-18T13:29:57 <amatas> yes,
2017-07-18T13:30:11 <amatas> if I remember well you can use the "gui" variable
2017-07-18T13:30:13 <amatas> let me check
2017-07-18T13:31:11 <amatas> yes, set the "gui" variable to false and it should work in headless mode

2017-07-18T18:25:47 <gtirloni> amatas: fyi, i was looking for a way to validate a Let\'s Encrypt certificate when I don\'t have access to change the web server (and validate the request) -- like with Vidyo. It looks like DNS validation is a thing (https://serverfault.com/questions/750902/how-to-use-lets-encrypt-dns-challenge-validation).. sharing in case you also need this one day

2017-07-18T19:16:45 <alanharnum> colinclark michelled danayo: relevant to some of the conversation about "what\'s the cheapest you can host a site for"? https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/make_it_better/2016/08/09/simple-websites-using-azure-storage-blob-service/
2017-07-18T19:16:59 <alanharnum> "I did some quick math, and hosting 1 GB of space, with 100k views would cost 3 cents a month."
2017-07-18T19:17:39 <alanharnum> i expect other "dump static HTML on a cloud storage service" strategies have similar costs.
