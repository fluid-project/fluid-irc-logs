2017-11-02T18:40:28 <simonjb> hi cindyli, would you be available for some infusion consulting?
2017-11-02T18:40:43 <cindyli> sure, simonjb
2017-11-02T18:40:49 <simonjb> awesome
2017-11-02T18:41:09 <simonjb> I\'m wondering what the best solution is to an issue I have
2017-11-02T18:41:27 <simonjb> I\'m using Colin\'s Flocking in one of the nexus-demos
2017-11-02T18:42:10 <simonjb> and for the particular web page that uses Flocking, it uses a packaged version of Flocking that includes Infusion 2.0
2017-11-02T18:42:30 <simonjb> however, the same page needs functionality from a dev release post 2.0
2017-11-02T18:42:40 <simonjb> I can think of 2 options:
2017-11-02T18:43:12 <simonjb> 1. use Flocking with the dev version of Infusion (which might not work, it functionality has changed or been removed)
2017-11-02T18:43:27 <simonjb> 2. use 2 versions of Infusion in the same web page
2017-11-02T18:44:15 <simonjb> is option (2) possible? are there existing examples, such as using name fluid2 and fluid3?
2017-11-02T18:44:29 <simonjb> or other recommendations?
2017-11-02T18:44:36 <simonjb> what would you do in this situation?
2017-11-02T18:44:52 <michelled> simonjb: we do test for option 2 when ever we make a release of fluid
2017-11-02T18:44:55 <michelled> let me find the test
2017-11-02T18:45:05 <simonjb> thanks michelled

2017-11-02T18:45:58 <michelled> simonjb: here is it on the build site: https://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/tests/manual-tests/framework/core/multipleVersions/

2017-11-02T18:57:35 <simonjb> michelled: in my case, I\'m using a new Infusion function (fluid.modelPairToChanges) in a component: fluid.modelPairToChanges
2017-11-02T18:57:46 <simonjb> https://github.com/simonbates/nexus-client/blob/master/src/NexusWebSocketBoundComponent.js#L156
2017-11-02T18:58:21 <simonjb> do you think the right fix would be to change the line assigning "fluid"?
2017-11-02T18:58:22 <simonjb> https://github.com/simonbates/nexus-client/blob/master/src/NexusWebSocketBoundComponent.js#L13
2017-11-02T18:58:56 <simonjb> to var fluid = fluid_3_0_0 || require("infusion")?
2017-11-02T18:59:10 <simonjb> to explicitly specify the version that I need?
2017-11-02T18:59:46 <michelled> simonjb: I think so - cindyli do you have an opinion?
2017-11-02T19:02:29 <cindyli> simonjb, michelled: i don\'t have much experience with using multiple version of infusion on the same page. but i think this is probably the easiest way to deal with this situatino
2017-11-02T19:02:43 <simonjb> maybe like this: https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/master/src/framework/preferences/js/SelfVoicingPanel.js
2017-11-02T19:03:00 <simonjb> it explicitly uses fluid_3_0_0
2017-11-02T19:03:59 <simonjb> thanks michelled and cindyli -- will try this
2017-11-02T19:05:46 <michelled> cool, it will be interesting to see if it works as we expect

2017-11-02T19:38:25 <simonjb> michelled, cindyli: it\'s worse than I thought -- I realise that I need to combine the components (Flocking-based, and Fluid 3.0.0-based) in the same component hierarchy
2017-11-02T19:38:45 <cindyli> :(
2017-11-02T19:39:01 <simonjb> which doesn\'t work if using separate independent Infusions
2017-11-02T19:39:30 <simonjb> because neither sees both grades
2017-11-02T19:40:09 <michelled> right. ugh
2017-11-02T19:40:21 <michelled> I wonder if Flocking would like an upgrade pull request :)
2017-11-02T19:40:45 <michelled> simonjb: do you know if colinclark is sticking with a particular version for any reason?
2017-11-02T19:40:55 <simonjb> I think the next thing to try is to see how the Flocking synth works with Infusion 3
2017-11-02T19:41:03 <simonjb> michelled: no, I don\'t know
2017-11-02T19:56:04 <simonjb> michelled, cindyli: ok success running with a post 2.0 version of Infusion -- yay backwards compatibility!
2017-11-02T19:56:25 <cindyli> that\'s great!
