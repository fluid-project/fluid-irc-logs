2013-10-29T20:17:28 <yzen> Bosmon: hi
2013-10-29T20:20:16 * cindyli1 has quit
2013-10-29T20:20:35 <yzen> wanted to consult with you about the sessions
2013-10-29T20:21:05 <Bosmon> yzenn - cool
2013-10-29T20:21:22 <yzen> so i was looking at the approach of dealing with them on handler basis
2013-10-29T20:27:31 * cindyli joined the channel
2013-10-29T20:30:42 <Bosmon> yzen - can you explain more?
2013-10-29T20:30:52 <yzen> right
2013-10-29T20:31:11 <yzen> so i was thinking of adding a needSession field for each handler along with route and type
2013-10-29T20:32:08 <yzen> so need session will apply the session middleware on the path when resolving that particular route
2013-10-29T20:32:15 <yzen> but there are a couple of interesting points
2013-10-29T20:33:09 <yzen> 1. how/when should the session be created 2. how to check if the current session is valid
2013-10-29T20:37:23 * clown_mtg has quit
2013-10-29T20:37:47 * mrvisser has quit
2013-10-29T20:38:03 * mrvisser joined the channel
2013-10-29T20:38:50 <Bosmon> yzen - it should be automatically created on the first request of a group which needs the session
2013-10-29T20:38:55 <Bosmon> The validity issue is an interesting one
2013-10-29T20:39:03 <yzen> yes
2013-10-29T20:39:07 <Bosmon> Which in some ways could be seen as a tradeoff between user convenience and security
2013-10-29T20:39:16 <yzen> ok so assuming it will be created
2013-10-29T20:39:22 <yzen> i think i have initial ideas about it
2013-10-29T20:39:43 <yzen> for the current scope
2013-10-29T20:39:49 <Bosmon> Can you think of a case when the session is required, but we don\'t require any particular info from it?
2013-10-29T20:39:54 <yzen> session creation and distraction can be handled within the handler itself ?
2013-10-29T20:40:06 <Bosmon> That is, a reason why simply seeing a dependence on {session} wouldn\'t be enough?
2013-10-29T20:40:09 <yzen> Bosmon: no at the moment
2013-10-29T20:40:55 <yzen> so for example on login i add session.userToken = ... AND on logout i do session.destroy()
2013-10-29T20:41:11 <Bosmon> ok
2013-10-29T20:41:28 <Bosmon> Seems reasonable enough
2013-10-29T20:41:55 <yzen> then i can have a preemptive middleware layer for all other needSession handlers that would send 400 back to the client and stopping propagation ?
2013-10-29T20:42:38 * cindyli has quit
2013-10-29T20:42:52 <Bosmon> yzen in theory, yes - although perhaps a 401 or 403 might be more appropriate in this case
2013-10-29T20:43:16 <Bosmon> I guess 403 in fact
2013-10-29T20:43:19 <yzen> ya i mean the 400 family
2013-10-29T20:43:33 <yzen> ok so ill try that approach
2013-10-29T20:44:21 <Bosmon> yzen - will you use a piece of existing session middleware?
2013-10-29T20:44:27 <Bosmon> For example, how will you manage expiry and persistence
2013-10-29T20:44:36 <yzen> yes
2013-10-29T20:47:13 <Bosmon> which one?
2013-10-29T20:51:51 * colinclark has quit
2013-10-29T20:58:06 <yzen> connect session

2013-10-29T21:27:40 * michelled has quit
2013-10-29T21:36:49 <Bosmon> yzen - does it do anything useful?
2013-10-29T21:36:59 <Bosmon> I notice that peculiarly the "cookie session" middleware is distinct
2013-10-29T21:37:05 <Bosmon> Do they have any relationship to one another?
2013-10-29T21:37:42 <yzen> i would need to take a look
