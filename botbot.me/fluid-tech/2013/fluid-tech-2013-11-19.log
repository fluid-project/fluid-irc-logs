2013-11-19T14:53:40 <yzen> Bosmon: hi
2013-11-19T14:53:43 <yzen> so this is my problem
2013-11-19T14:53:54 <yzen> i might have a config for gpii that includes another config
2013-11-19T14:54:13 <yzen> both of them might specify grade names for the same component (some kettle app)
2013-11-19T14:54:20 <yzen> i want to merge them correctly
2013-11-19T14:54:23 <yzen> which is concat
2013-11-19T14:54:32 <yzen> and not the default array merge
2013-11-19T14:54:48 * clown joined the channel
2013-11-19T14:55:03 <Bosmon> Ok
2013-11-19T14:55:26 <Bosmon> As with our other issue ("root reference to listeners") the solution is most likely to have the gradeNames in the correct place already
2013-11-19T14:55:43 <Bosmon> That is, to have them in a component option named "gradeNames" rather than to expect to merge them differently from any other location
2013-11-19T14:57:56 <yzen> well they are
2013-11-19T14:58:00 <yzen> let me give you an example
2013-11-19T14:58:25 <yzen> one config has {someComponent: {options: {gradeNames: [...]}}, includes: [\'otherconfig.json\']}
2013-11-19T14:58:42 <yzen> otherconfig.json has {someComponent: {options: {gradeNames: [...]}}}
2013-11-19T14:58:57 <Bosmon> ok
2013-11-19T14:59:08 <yzen> so when i merge them together gradeNames will be overwritten instead of concatted
2013-11-19T14:59:12 <Bosmon> I guess this turns closely on exactly how the "includes" process is operated
2013-11-19T14:59:13 <Bosmon> Right
2013-11-19T14:59:19 <Bosmon> So you should let the framework do the merging, rather than you
2013-11-19T15:00:24 <yzen> great :) how do i do that ?
2013-11-19T15:00:33 <yzen> is there a magic function i can use :) ?
2013-11-19T15:00:49 <Bosmon> I suggest that you use no magic function
2013-11-19T15:00:59 <Bosmon> But continue with our general approach of drawing up "nonce grades"
2013-11-19T15:01:08 <Bosmon> That is, the result of an "include" from the filesystem should be a GRADE....
2013-11-19T15:01:20 <Bosmon> And, you can then get further benefits as a result of being able to cache it, etc.
2013-11-19T15:01:28 <yzen> ok
