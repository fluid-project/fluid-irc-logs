2013-08-27T20:24:28 <Bosmon> Hi yzen - did you get any further with the kettle context issue?
2013-08-27T20:27:10 <yzen> so a quick question
2013-08-27T20:27:11 <yzen> if i m removing all wrapping stuf
2013-08-27T20:27:12 <yzen> f
2013-08-27T20:27:12 <yzen> does it mean i can get rid of with environment and just call the function as is ?
2013-08-27T20:27:29 <Bosmon> yzen - you shouldn\'t need withEnvironment any more, right
2013-08-27T20:27:36 <Bosmon> The component tree should be good enough just by itself
2013-08-27T20:27:43 <yzen> ok trying
2013-08-27T20:27:44 <yzen> :)
2013-08-27T20:30:29 <yzen> Bosmon: and in cases when i used to do:
2013-08-27T20:30:30 <yzen> fluid.expand("{request}", {
2013-08-27T20:30:31 <yzen> fetcher: fluid.makeEnvironmentFetcher()
2013-08-27T20:30:31 <yzen> });
2013-08-27T20:30:44 <Bosmon> yzen - that should also be unnecessary
2013-08-27T20:30:53 <yzen> so where would i get a request from
2013-08-27T20:31:05 <yzen> for example in case where we want to handle errors
2013-08-27T20:31:07 <yzen> in utils
2013-08-27T20:31:07 <Bosmon> The request should be one of your parents in the tree ....
2013-08-27T20:31:26 <Bosmon> Ah, errors
2013-08-27T20:31:42 <Bosmon> Well, you should try to always have a component to hand
2013-08-27T20:32:12 <Bosmon> humm
2013-08-27T20:32:51 <Bosmon> This stuff is still so annoying
2013-08-27T20:33:02 <Bosmon> I\'ll need to have more shower thoughts
2013-08-27T20:39:39 * cindyli has quit
2013-08-27T20:53:00 <yzen> ok
2013-08-27T21:03:30 * clown_mtg has left the channel
2013-08-27T21:14:43 <Bosmon> yzen - perhaps it is not possible to fix after all :(
2013-08-27T21:14:47 <kasparnet> is that sneaky Brit trying to hide from our annoying questions in the fluid-work channel
2013-08-27T21:14:53 <Bosmon> Especially in the case of things like "uncaughtException"
2013-08-27T21:14:57 <Bosmon> kasparnet - yes
2013-08-27T21:15:18 <yzen> Bosmon: :(
2013-08-27T21:15:23 <Bosmon> I have just been learning about how King Alfred BAPTISED THE PAGAN .......
2013-08-27T21:16:40 <Bosmon> The vicious KING GUTHRUM OF THE VIKINGS
2013-08-27T21:17:31 <kasparnet> haha, I dont know either of those
2013-08-27T21:17:59 <Bosmon> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Wedmore
2013-08-27T21:20:25 <michelled> kasparnet: are you hiding from me :)
2013-08-27T21:23:11 <kasparnet> michelled: hehe sorry - I didn\'t see your ping
2013-08-27T21:23:37 <kasparnet> but you\'re probably gonna ask me about the status of the release.. and in that case, I might try to hide from you
2013-08-27T21:24:16 <michelled> I was going to ask if you wanted to meet with me tomorrow before the arch meeting
2013-08-27T21:24:32 <michelled> and *then* I was going to ask you about the release
2013-08-27T21:24:35 <kasparnet> Bosmon, yura: is there a magic place where I can put a breakpoint that\'ll catch all th exceptions thrown during the flowmanager flow
2013-08-27T21:24:54 <Bosmon> kasparnet - you could have been paying attention to our discussion :)
2013-08-27T21:25:13 <kasparnet> michelled: I can meet before before the architecture meeting... That is 16:00 CEST = 10 am EST
2013-08-27T21:25:15 <Bosmon> For example, if they are REAL exceptions, you can find them in utils.js
2013-08-27T21:25:24 <Bosmon> Although the stack frame will be gone by that time
2013-08-27T21:25:49 <kasparnet> there is a device reporter meeting immediately before the arch. meeting
2013-08-27T21:25:56 <michelled> sounds good kasparnet
2013-08-27T21:26:07 <michelled> 10 EST it is
2013-08-27T21:26:15 <kasparnet> cool - putting it on my calendar! Thanks michelled
2013-08-27T21:26:22 <michelled> np :)
2013-08-27T21:26:27 <Bosmon> There\'s also the "onErrorHandler" in requests.js - kasparnet
2013-08-27T21:27:24 <Bosmon> DDAMMMNNN YYYOOUUUU, KASSPPAAARNEEETTTTT!!!!
2013-08-27T21:27:50 <kasparnet> haha, I was just about to write thanks, Bosmon.. but now I\'m not so sure :)
2013-08-27T21:35:49 <Bosmon> Hey yzen
