2013-10-21T17:59:32 <yzen> Bosmon2:
2013-10-21T17:59:45 <yzen> i wanted to talk sessions with you
2013-10-21T18:00:05 <yzen> i realized that they are necessary to be able to push updates from the flow manager to the client

2013-10-21T18:46:21 <Bosmon> Hi yzen
2013-10-21T18:47:07 <yzen> hi
2013-10-21T18:48:34 <yzen> so if you see from above, we would need sessions for push
2013-10-21T18:48:56 <Bosmon> yes
2013-10-21T18:49:07 <Bosmon> Is this different to the work package for which socket.io is required?
2013-10-21T18:50:07 <yzen> no i guess not
2013-10-21T18:50:08 <yzen> another thing
2013-10-21T18:50:39 <yzen> i m not sure it is possible to be send messages from the client to a server to the route like /user:token
2013-10-21T18:50:50 <yzen> because it\'s not really dynamically resolvable
2013-10-21T18:51:44 <Bosmon> What do you mean by dynamically resolvable?

2013-10-21T19:40:18 * yzen joined the channel
2013-10-21T19:42:33 <yzen> so I\'m not 100% sure yet
2013-10-21T19:42:46 <yzen> but when messages are passed around the server and the client
2013-10-21T19:42:57 <yzen> Bosmon: ^
2013-10-21T19:43:12 <Bosmon> yzen
2013-10-21T19:43:17 <yzen> we would want to be able to send a message to someToken/update
2013-10-21T19:43:39 <Bosmon> A common solution for managing sessions is to supply a particular hash value that the client is to supply to identify itself in future HTTP headers
2013-10-21T19:43:40 <yzen> i m trying to figure out what would the socket.io on the server listen to
2013-10-21T19:43:56 <Bosmon> I believe that since we would also operate HTTP over websockets, this would continue to be viable
2013-10-21T19:44:58 <yzen> Bosmon: yes well with sessions sure, i m sure there are reliable npm module for that
2013-10-21T19:50:44 <Bosmon> yzen - does this sound like the same problem you are thinking of?
2013-10-21T19:51:10 <yzen> sorry i m being confusing
2013-10-21T19:51:18 <yzen> there are 2 tasks basically not 1
2013-10-21T19:51:23 <yzen> 1 - session support
2013-10-21T19:52:03 <yzen> 2 - ability to listen to paths (through sockets) that the server might not know about until it receives a message for example: token1/update and token2/update
2013-10-21T19:54:46 <Bosmon> yzen - what are token1 and token2 in this case?
2013-10-21T19:54:51 <Bosmon> And why might the server not know about them?
2013-10-21T19:55:05 <yzen> sure
2013-10-21T19:55:12 <yzen> so you know how we angle http to login user
2013-10-21T19:55:21 <yzen> user/:token/login
2013-10-21T19:55:41 <yzen> the way we express it is exactly as above where :token is going to be parsed by express routing
2013-10-21T19:55:53 <yzen> with sockets we would want something like
2013-10-21T19:56:35 <yzen> user/:token/update
2013-10-21T19:56:43 <yzen> or simply :token/update
2013-10-21T19:57:01 <yzen> Socket io does not have anything that can help us with that
2013-10-21T19:57:14 <yzen> the way it works is we explicitly add listeners on paths
2013-10-21T19:57:22 <yzen> but the server does not know what the :token might be
2013-10-21T19:57:39 <yzen> so what i mean by all that is that we would need to handle routing for that ourselves
2013-10-21T20:01:16 <yzen> btw, is it possible to destroy the component from within itself
2013-10-21T20:01:17 <yzen> ?
2013-10-21T20:07:48 <Bosmon> Sure, you can call its destroy() method
2013-10-21T20:07:58 <Bosmon> But I\'m not sure I understand about the limitations on what path a socket listens on
2013-10-21T20:08:12 <yzen> i can just call that.destroy()
2013-10-21T20:08:21 <Bosmon> The situation is certainly identical to that for express - one listens on a PORT, not on a path
2013-10-21T20:08:26 <Bosmon> Yes
2013-10-21T20:08:39 <Bosmon> Can you point me to the relevant node API?
2013-10-21T20:09:30 <yzen> this for example https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/gpii/node_modules/flowManager/src/FlowManager.js#L79
2013-10-21T20:09:48 <yzen> I\'m not sure how this can be handled in socket.io without extra work
2013-10-21T20:19:23 <Bosmon> yzen - we had always been planning to implement our own routing someday for kettle anyway
2013-10-21T20:19:28 <Bosmon> Now is a good time to start : P
2013-10-21T20:19:36 <yzen> i don\'t think it is
2013-10-21T20:19:49 <Bosmon> Come on, you can do it LIKE A BOSS :)
2013-10-21T20:20:46 <Bosmon> It appears that the "router" module within express is standalone anyway
2013-10-21T20:22:26 <Bosmon> It appears it is set up in express\' file application.js
2013-10-21T20:24:48 <yzen> like a boss: https://github.com/yzen/kettle/blob/GPII-75/test/SocketTests.js
2013-10-21T20:26:51 <Bosmon> Looks cool!
2013-10-21T20:26:55 <Bosmon> now all you need is some ROUTING : P
2013-10-21T20:28:04 <yzen> http://meme.andreavenditti.com/okay.png
2013-10-21T20:28:33 <Bosmon> No no, not that one, this one :)
