2013-10-22T19:41:04 <yzen> Bosmon: hi
2013-10-22T19:42:30 * kasparnet joined the channel
2013-10-22T19:42:30 <Bosmon> Hi yzen!
2013-10-22T19:42:35 <Bosmon> How is stuff with socket.io?
2013-10-22T19:42:41 <yzen> Bosmon: well working on the session
2013-10-22T19:42:44 <Bosmon> Sorry I didn\'t look at you branch yet, I will be able to cast an eye over it soon
2013-10-22T19:42:48 <yzen> np
2013-10-22T19:43:03 <yzen> i m thinking of how to configure which handlers fall into "session" category
2013-10-22T19:43:11 <yzen> e,g, require session
2013-10-22T19:43:25 <yzen> and how this configuration is expressed best
2013-10-22T19:56:47 <Bosmon> yzen - session, morally, is part of the "routing information" for a handler
2013-10-22T19:57:01 <yzen> Bosmon: right
2013-10-22T19:57:03 <Bosmon> Which is part of why I was interested for us to start getting into this business for ourselves : P
2013-10-22T19:57:04 <yzen> so i thought
2013-10-22T19:57:38 <Bosmon> tbh a simple enough scheme would just be to appeal to the existence of a context named {session}
2013-10-22T19:57:45 <Bosmon> You can do some of the work of operating this manually
2013-10-22T19:57:54 <Bosmon> But it could appear to the user as if it is a genuine reference
2013-10-22T20:10:42 <Bosmon> We could hang numerous things into the session, but perhaps for now we will just expect access to {session}.id to retrieve the key which defines it
2013-10-22T20:11:01 <Bosmon> I guess the question is what, if anything we do with this information since the handler itself may not consume it.......
2013-10-22T20:11:31 <Bosmon> I did consider for a while adding a "depends-on" element to IoC which fetches a reference which is then just discarded.......
2013-10-22T20:11:39 <Bosmon> But it would make a sort of architectural mess
