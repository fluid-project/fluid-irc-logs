2013-10-02T16:40:59 <yzen_> so Bosmon , i m trying to figure out again how i can create a conditional invoker
2013-10-02T16:41:10 <yzen_> Bosmon: afaik it won't work with a  dynamic grade
2013-10-02T16:41:53 <Bosmon> yzen_ or yzen - that could be right
2013-10-02T16:41:58 <Bosmon> Can you explain the situation in more detail?
2013-10-02T16:42:20 <yzen_> Bosmon: that's for the data sources and the conditional set invoker
2013-10-02T16:42:30 <yzen_> that is only added right now in pre init if writable option is true
2013-10-02T16:43:10 <Bosmon> Certainly this sounds like a dynamic grade situation
2013-10-02T16:48:13 <yzen_> Bosmon: yes but there's an existing jira i believe that does not let us add an invoker if it belongs to a grade that is added dynamically
2013-10-02T16:48:49 <Bosmon> yzen_ - I don't believe there is such an issue.... can you find it?
2013-10-02T16:48:55 <yzen_> sure
2013-10-02T16:49:00 <Bosmon> cheers

2013-10-02T16:53:53 <yzen_> Bosmon: so do you suggest that this should work ?

2013-10-02T17:03:16 * mrvisser joined the channel
2013-10-02T17:05:51 <Bosmon> yzen - shouldn't be a problem
2013-10-02T17:06:10 <Bosmon> I know that cindyli has an outstanding JIRA about dynamic grades that are themselves added dynamically

2013-10-02T19:45:54 <Bosmon> yzen - looks reasonable
2013-10-02T19:46:17 <yzen> Bosmon: does not seem to work, ill make a test case then ?
2013-10-02T19:46:46 <Bosmon> yzen - sure
2013-10-02T19:46:51 <Bosmon> What do you observe when it fails?

2013-10-02T19:58:54 <yzen> Bosmon: well i m checking if set invoker is on that but it is not
2013-10-02T20:01:12 <Bosmon> Do you observe the same as cindyli when you look at the gradeNames list, i.e. that the dynamic grade is not expanded?
2013-10-02T20:01:28 <Bosmon> I imagine your test case involves the further use of a dynamic grade somewhere
2013-10-02T20:03:19 <cindyli> yzen: the jira I filed for the issue with the dynamic grade: http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-5155
2013-10-02T20:03:38 <yzen> cindyli: ya i saw it , not sure if this is the exact same thing
2013-10-02T20:03:45 <cindyli> ok
