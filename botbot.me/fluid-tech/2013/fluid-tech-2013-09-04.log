2013-09-04T20:45:23 <yzen> so Bosmon2 and I were chatting about the lifecycle manager and how it will be wrapped into a kettle.app
2013-09-04T20:46:01 <yzen> i was asking either Bosmon2 or Bosmon8 about the preferred name for the component that currently represents the lifecycle manager
2013-09-04T20:46:18 <yzen> but will end up being an additional grade for the life cycle manager kettle app
2013-09-04T20:47:07 <Bosmon2> Is the discussion different, depending on whether it is a base grade or a subcomponent?
2013-09-04T20:47:15 <Bosmon2> I imagine it should be mostly the same ....
2013-09-04T20:47:19 <yzen> yes
2013-09-04T20:47:28 <yzen> it mostly the same
2013-09-04T20:47:39 <yzen> and not sure what the base grade really means
2013-09-04T20:47:52 <yzen> since the new lifecycle manager app will have 2 base grades
2013-09-04T20:48:01 <Bosmon2> You said "end up being an additional grade"
2013-09-04T20:48:02 <yzen> kettle.app and the original lifecycle manager component
2013-09-04T20:48:04 <Bosmon2> Yes
2013-09-04T20:48:07 <yzen> yes
2013-09-04T20:48:14 <Bosmon2> That is certainly one way of implementing it
2013-09-04T20:48:30 <Bosmon2> So I guess namespacing and IoC name resolution can make this awkward
2013-09-04T20:48:36 <Bosmon2> Given we have a namespace gpii.lifecycleManager
2013-09-04T20:48:42 <Bosmon2> Which at the moment refers to the thing itself
2013-09-04T20:48:58 <Bosmon2> I don\'t know if it would be awkward to refer to the app as gpii.lifecycleManager.app
2013-09-04T20:48:58 <yzen> correct
2013-09-04T20:49:04 <yzen> it will be
2013-09-04T20:49:15 <yzen> because externally app is meaningless
2013-09-04T20:49:24 <Bosmon2> Since the name "app" appearing in resolution might cause ambiguity
2013-09-04T20:49:36 <Bosmon2> In what way is it meaningless?
2013-09-04T20:49:45 <Bosmon2> You mean, because every other GPII server is just named after itself?
2013-09-04T20:50:55 <yzen> it becomes slightly different from the rest of the naming of apps that we have and slightly harder to follow, because really unless you are interested in the internals of the lifecycle manager app, you only know about the "gpii.lifecycleManager"
2013-09-04T20:51:53 <Bosmon2> I see that the current implementation of LifecycleManager is extremely ancient in any case
2013-09-04T20:52:13 <yzen> it is already chaining as we speak
2013-09-04T20:52:19 <Bosmon2> great
2013-09-04T20:52:24 <Bosmon2> Are you using wire\'s "reduce" scheme?
2013-09-04T20:53:24 <yzen> Bosmon2: not yet
2013-09-04T20:53:38 <yzen> that will be done only after i make sure flow manager is split up from the lifecycle manager
2013-09-04T20:53:42 <Bosmon2> Ok, so it seems we frequently use the suffix "Server" for those things which are servers
2013-09-04T20:53:51 <Bosmon2> How about naming the actual app as "LifecycleManagerServer"?
2013-09-04T20:54:30 <yzen> that\'s the thing i was hoping to keep the server as "lifecycleManager" and have the current one being "lifecycleManager[SOMETHING]"
2013-09-04T20:55:13 * michelled has quit
2013-09-04T20:56:42 <Bosmon2> Well, it\'s awkward that our architecture is messed up in other areas
2013-09-04T20:56:55 <Bosmon2> For example the MatchMaker is not structured properly in this way, so it isn\'t useful as a template for this problem
2013-09-04T20:57:12 <Bosmon2> It only exists in the "app" variant and all of its polymorphism is just stuffed onto the app itself
2013-09-04T20:57:18 <yzen> yes
2013-09-04T20:57:20 <Bosmon2> Rather than there being any such thing as a "real Matchmaker"
2013-09-04T20:57:38 <Bosmon2> So in a sense this is the first time we encounter this problem ....

2013-09-04T21:00:14 * yzen has quit
2013-09-04T21:00:22 <Bosmon2> One thing yzen - I wonder if there is a way we can adjust the "promise returning" aspect of DataSource to occur through grade addition
