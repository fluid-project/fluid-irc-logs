2013-11-07T16:00:49 <the-t-in-rtf> Can anyone recommend a reasonable library that can handle RDF+XML from within node?
2013-11-07T16:01:05 <the-t-in-rtf> I am working with OWL data and running into oddities with nearly every library I try
2013-11-07T16:01:26 <the-t-in-rtf> I can get the "rdf" module to work if I manually convert the file to turtle format using rdflib
2013-11-07T16:01:43 <the-t-in-rtf> but ideally I need something that can just go out, get the RDF+XML and work with that directly.
2013-11-07T16:03:23 * colinclark joined the channel
2013-11-07T16:03:56 <the-t-in-rtf> Sorry, I should have said, I can get the "rdf" module for node to load the turtle data at least until it runs out of memory\xe2\x80\xa6 ;)
2013-11-07T16:16:29 <Bosmon7> the-t-in-rtf - I can\'t say I\'m aware of such a library - but I\'m interested in where this OWL data has come from?
2013-11-07T16:17:05 <the-t-in-rtf> Kostas
2013-11-07T16:17:58 <the-t-in-rtf> I am writing a very dirty XSL script that will certainly not get to know the data as a person and will not respect it in the morning, but which will likely get the job done.
2013-11-07T16:18:06 <Bosmon7> What is "the job" in question here?
2013-11-07T16:19:42 <the-t-in-rtf> extracting common terms from an OWL file with no need to preserve the hierarchy or relationships
2013-11-07T16:19:54 <the-t-in-rtf> to populate the common terms registry
2013-11-07T16:25:34 <colinclark> hey the-t-in-rtf !
2013-11-07T16:25:39 <colinclark> HIYA
2013-11-07T16:25:59 <colinclark> So, shouldn\'t the semantic framework be doing the work of exporting its pile of RDF into JSON?
2013-11-07T16:26:04 <colinclark> rather than you having to do it?
2013-11-07T16:26:22 <colinclark> Am I mistaken in thinking this was part of what K and Gregg agreed on?
2013-11-07T16:26:54 <the-t-in-rtf> Longer term I would surely hope there is a more digestible format.
2013-11-07T16:27:11 <the-t-in-rtf> Right now I\'m just pulling out what they\'ve imported from the spreadsheet and sanity checking before our review.
2013-11-07T16:27:18 <colinclark> bummer
2013-11-07T16:27:19 <the-t-in-rtf> The only format they have at the moment is OWL
2013-11-07T16:27:33 <colinclark> seems to me your life would have been a lot easier if you\'d just consumed the spreadsheet directly
2013-11-07T16:27:37 <the-t-in-rtf> Oh
2013-11-07T16:27:44 <the-t-in-rtf> I wrote that part two weeks ago
2013-11-07T16:27:44 <the-t-in-rtf> :)
2013-11-07T16:27:49 <colinclark> I thought so :)
2013-11-07T16:27:59 <colinclark> So what does the OWL contain that is unique?
2013-11-07T16:28:38 <the-t-in-rtf> As far as I am aware, it all came from the spreadsheet as well.
2013-11-07T16:28:44 <the-t-in-rtf> part of what I will be doing is comparing the two
2013-11-07T16:30:45 <colinclark> ugh
2013-11-07T16:32:51 <colinclark> It\'s hard to know how to navigate this space, the-t-in-rtf...
2013-11-07T16:33:19 <colinclark> It\'s really important for things that are connected to the larger GPII ecosystem to agree on at least the basic interchange standards of that ecosystem
2013-11-07T16:33:28 <colinclark> RDF is not one of those ;)
2013-11-07T16:34:15 <the-t-in-rtf> Great to hear
2013-11-07T16:38:10 <colinclark> Were it up to me, I\'d way rather see you spec\'ing out a JSON format that the semantic framework will conform to
2013-11-07T16:53:40 <the-t-in-rtf> I would expect to figure that out when we talk about syncing in more depth.  I don\'t think it\'ll be reasonable to consume OWL more than once.
2013-11-07T16:53:51 <the-t-in-rtf> The feathers get stuck between your teeth and there\'s not much meat.
2013-11-07T16:53:59 <the-t-in-rtf> so to speak.

2013-11-07T17:34:17 <colinclark> the-t-in-rtf: So I think I get this, ultimately
2013-11-07T17:34:21 <colinclark> this is just a one-off
2013-11-07T17:34:52 <colinclark> you bbq the owl, and then you\'ll never have to eat it again :)
2013-11-07T17:34:57 <colinclark> is that right?
2013-11-07T17:37:47 <the-t-in-rtf> If chickens are any indication, you dip them in boiling water and pluck them
2013-11-07T17:37:54 <the-t-in-rtf> and you can only do that once per bird
2013-11-07T17:40:06 <the-t-in-rtf> For those of you who don\'t know me, I\'m like the alien from "Darmok", I only explain things by comparison with other things.
