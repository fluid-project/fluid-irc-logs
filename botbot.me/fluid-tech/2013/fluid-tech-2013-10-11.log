2013-10-11T14:10:43 <chrispetsos> Hi Justin, maybe we can sort the preview text here without spamming the C4A list?
2013-10-11T14:11:34 <chrispetsos> I have some time for today, otherwise let\'s leave it for Monday (or Tuesday if it\'s a day off there)
2013-10-11T14:22:04 <Justin_o> chrispetsos: yes.. monday is a holiday for us... but i have some time now
2013-10-11T14:22:30 <chrispetsos> ok, so i am having that problem that container is not set
2013-10-11T14:22:31 * sgithens has quit
2013-10-11T14:23:05 <Justin_o> chrispetsos: your latest code is in your git repo?
2013-10-11T14:23:12 <chrispetsos> yes
2013-10-11T14:23:31 <chrispetsos> https://github.com/chrispetsos/prefsEditors/blob/master/src/shared/adjusters/js/ContrastAdjuster.js
2013-10-11T14:23:42 <Justin_o> thank you
2013-10-11T14:26:47 <Justin_o> chrispetsos: okay.. i see the problem.. kind of my fault actually
2013-10-11T14:28:08 <Justin_o> chrispetsos: so the enhancer subcomponent uses a createOnEvent.. so when we used the IoC reference to it in the listener, it tries to instantiate it then instead of waiting for the createOnEvent.. even if that worked.. it wouldn\'t actually have set the text because the events are the same.. since the createOnEvent is bound to \'onReady;
2013-10-11T14:28:18 * michelled joined the channel
2013-10-11T14:28:43 <Justin_o> chrispetsos: so you can fix this by moving the listener into the enhancer instead.. for example onCreate
2013-10-11T14:28:52 <Justin_o> listener: {
2013-10-11T14:28:52 <Justin_o> "onCreate.setText": {
2013-10-11T14:28:52 <Justin_o> listener: "{that}.setText"
2013-10-11T14:28:52 <Justin_o> }
2013-10-11T14:28:52 <Justin_o> },
2013-10-11T14:29:30 <Justin_o> chrispetsos: let me know if that fixes everything
2013-10-11T14:31:35 <cindyli> Justin_o, since setText invoker is used only once in the onCreate listener, chrispetsos can attach it onto the listener directly
2013-10-11T14:31:41 <cindyli> listeners: {
2013-10-11T14:31:41 <cindyli> \t                                onCreate: {
2013-10-11T14:31:41 <cindyli> \t                                    "this": "{that}.dom.previewText",
2013-10-11T14:31:41 <cindyli> \t                                    "method": "text",
2013-10-11T14:31:41 <cindyli> \t                                    "args": ["{that}.options.strings.previewText"]
2013-10-11T14:31:42 <cindyli> \t                                }
2013-10-11T14:31:42 <cindyli> }
2013-10-11T14:31:53 <Justin_o> cindyli: that makes sense
2013-10-11T14:32:33 <chrispetsos> thanks guys, that worked perfectly
2013-10-11T14:32:50 <Justin_o> chrispetsos: great.. sorry about the misinformation earlier
2013-10-11T14:32:51 <cindyli> yay!

2013-10-11T14:34:35 <cindyli> it looks good, chrispetsos
2013-10-11T14:35:13 <chrispetsos> OKguys thanks, i\'ll now make the pull request to GPII/prefsEditors
2013-10-11T14:35:27 <chrispetsos> ...and happy reviewing! :-)
