2013-12-10T22:07:07 <Bosmon> yzen has asked me to deal with his pull request https://github.com/GPII/universal/pull/171
2013-12-10T22:07:19 <Bosmon> In the following discussion, it has emerged that it is "untestable" for various reasons
2013-12-10T22:07:26 <Bosmon> And therefore, in my view, "unpushable"
2013-12-10T22:07:37 <Bosmon> So we are discussing what is the appropriate strategy for such things
2013-12-10T22:07:53 <yzen> correct
2013-12-10T22:08:11 <yzen> the main obstacle is the introduction of solutions.gpii.net address
2013-12-10T22:08:12 <Bosmon> In the very worst case, we are stuck with insisting that someone constructs a VM image, with, for example, a "hosts" entry for solutions.gpii.net which resolves to localhost
2013-12-10T22:08:29 <Bosmon> But we are trying to see which parts of the problem can be chipped off separately
2013-12-10T22:08:34 <Bosmon> For example the presence of CORS support
2013-12-10T22:08:41 <Bosmon> Or the requirement for a working Couch server
2013-12-10T22:10:01 <Bosmon> It seems that for one reason or another, we are very behind with our process of constructing testing VMs
2013-12-10T22:10:15 <Bosmon> But I feel that this is a highly appropriate point to block our workflow insisting that some of them arrive : P
2013-12-10T22:11:34 <yzen> michelled: ^
2013-12-10T22:12:59 <michelled> awesomely, avtar is working on a linux test VM at the moment. so one might arrive.
2013-12-10T22:14:07 <michelled> the problem, Bosmon, is that kasper is the one tasked with creating test VMs. He is also tasked with tons of blockers for the review. I\'m very concerned about us making the review deadline. we tried to lessen scope, but it seems like we are down to the bone already
2013-12-10T22:14:26 <michelled> I\'m not arguing for pushing untested code, mind you
2013-12-10T22:14:38 <michelled> but I\'m not sure where we get the resources for creating the testing VMs.
2013-12-10T22:14:55 <michelled> yzen: would the VM that avtar is currently working on solve this issue?
2013-12-10T22:20:10 <Bosmon> So I can think of a few ways of mitigating this issue in the short term
2013-12-10T22:20:23 <Bosmon> And there is a further discussion to be had about how we "manage production configurations"
2013-12-10T22:20:46 <Bosmon> In the fullness of time, we will get to the point where "not 100% of what is necessary to make a production configuration can be committed to public source control"
2013-12-10T22:20:58 <Bosmon> Since we will have in it things like passwords, certificates, API keys etc.
2013-12-10T22:21:11 <Bosmon> Which implies that we will need to think about a separate level of configuration in any case
2013-12-10T22:21:46 <Bosmon> So I think one thing that would be useful would be a kind of "flat file" which can be recognised by the configuration, holding such truly vital things as URLs, keys etc.
2013-12-10T22:22:34 <Bosmon> This will be similar in spirit to the "auxiliary schema" that we have for the prefs framework - that is, a piece of configuration much simpler in structure than general IoC configuration, which can be referred to from our "real" configuration files
2013-12-10T22:23:09 <Bosmon> SO - if we could split out, for example, the configuration of the specific URL "solutions.gpii.net" into this file, it would open the door to making the production system more mockable, and more susceptible to receiving "acceptance tests" or "integration tests"
2013-12-10T22:24:26 <Bosmon> yzen could then write i) a version of this file that mocks out this URL to localhost, ii) a fake and very simple "solutions registry" that is just capable of servicing a few requests for tests, iii) acceptance tests which verify the CORS headers on the server even if they are somewhat meaningless in that they refer to localhost
2013-12-10T22:24:51 <Bosmon> This would give us at least any kind of automated reassurance at all that the code currently in the pull request does something
2013-12-10T22:25:06 <Bosmon> Once the VMs arrive we could then go up to the next level of testing
