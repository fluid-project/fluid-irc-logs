2013-10-24T01:29:21 <Bosmon> Hi yzen - what do you mean by "the sequence not started"?

2013-10-24T03:32:57 <yzen> Bosmon: so here\'s my test use case
2013-10-24T03:33:04 <yzen> i have a server that supports sockets
2013-10-24T03:33:06 <yzen> and a client
2013-10-24T03:33:29 <yzen> the thing about the test is that the client can only connect to the server after the server is listening on a port (e.g. completely ready)
2013-10-24T03:33:33 <yzen> which is understandable
2013-10-24T03:33:40 <yzen> so my question was
2013-10-24T03:34:01 <yzen> how do i prevent the sequence steps happening before the client and the server are both initialized
2013-10-24T03:35:29 <yzen> Bosmon: ^
2013-10-24T03:37:08 <Bosmon> yzen - insert a listener for an event which only occurs on initialisation?
2013-10-24T03:37:15 <Bosmon> Sounds like it could be done with some boiling
2013-10-24T03:37:30 <yzen> well let me show you what i have
2013-10-24T04:01:49 <yzen> so Bosmon these are my components and the start of the sequence {tests} is the testcaseholder
2013-10-24T04:01:50 <yzen> http://pastebin.com/rDtcGDAr
2013-10-24T04:14:43 <Bosmon> yzen - so where is the client component?
2013-10-24T04:14:54 <Bosmon> And - in fact - don\'t both of them initialise synchronously?
2013-10-24T04:18:43 <yzen> Bosmon: in the sequence if i want to just wait for an event and do nothing, do i still have to specify a listener ?
2013-10-24T04:20:44 * colinclark joined the channel
2013-10-24T04:21:24 <Bosmon> yzen - sure
2013-10-24T04:21:28 <Bosmon> The listener marks a sequence point
2013-10-24T04:21:34 <Bosmon> You are not really doing nothing, you are waiting :)
2013-10-24T04:21:44 <yzen> Bosmon: so fluid.identity is ok ?
2013-10-24T04:21:49 <Bosmon> yzen - sure
2013-10-24T04:21:52 <yzen> ok

2013-10-24T20:13:30 <Bosmon> Hi yzen
2013-10-24T20:13:42 <Bosmon> ADKINS was here earlier, asking for information about how to make a kettle app
2013-10-24T20:13:45 <Bosmon> His nick is the-t-in-rtf
2013-10-24T20:15:14 <yzen> Bosmon: hi
2013-10-24T20:15:17 <yzen> hi the-t-in-rtf
2013-10-24T20:15:41 <yzen> Bosmon: at what point the members resolve ?
2013-10-24T20:15:58 <Bosmon> yzen - everything is resolved by the ginger process
2013-10-24T20:16:01 <Bosmon> There is no "point" any more
2013-10-24T20:16:45 <yzen> Bosmon: for some reason if i have 3 members that are all expanders and one depends on the other depends on the other
2013-10-24T20:16:52 <yzen> they do not get resolved
2013-10-24T20:16:55 <yzen> correctly
2013-10-24T20:17:29 <Bosmon> Unless there is a circular dependence, it should be fine
2013-10-24T20:17:58 <Bosmon> Please do make a test case :)

2013-10-24T20:38:17 * cindyli has quit
2013-10-24T21:03:03 <yzen> so Bosmon
2013-10-24T21:03:05 <yzen> i have this
2013-10-24T21:03:20 <yzen> members has
2013-10-24T21:03:24 <yzen> io: {
2013-10-24T21:03:24 <yzen> expander: {
2013-10-24T21:03:26 <yzen> func: "kettle.use.io.makeIO",
2013-10-24T21:03:28 <yzen> args: ["{that}.httpServer", "{that}.options.ioOptions"]
2013-10-24T21:03:28 <yzen> }
2013-10-24T21:03:29 <yzen> }
2013-10-24T21:03:48 <yzen> and makeIO looks like this
2013-10-24T21:03:49 <yzen> kettle.use.io.makeIO = function (httpServer, ioOptions) {
2013-10-24T21:03:50 <yzen> return require("socket.io").listen(httpServer); };
2013-10-24T21:04:01 <yzen> this does not work
2013-10-24T21:04:18 <Bosmon> meaning?
2013-10-24T21:04:20 <yzen> but if i have a final init function where i say that.io = require("socket.io").listen(httpServer);
2013-10-24T21:04:35 <yzen> well the server does not receive the socket events
2013-10-24T21:05:35 <Bosmon> What is "io"?
2013-10-24T21:06:15 <yzen> it\'s an instance of socket.io
2013-10-24T21:09:15 <Bosmon> And what goes wrong in the expander case?
2013-10-24T21:11:55 * clown has left the channel
2013-10-24T21:13:27 <yzen> well i m not sure
2013-10-24T21:13:47 <yzen> I\'m just always worried about |this| and if something happens to it
2013-10-24T21:15:21 <Bosmon> Where is the "this"?
2013-10-24T21:15:32 <Bosmon> Do do the contents of the arguments to kettle.use.io.makeIO look correct?
2013-10-24T21:16:01 <Bosmon> That is - if the arguments are the same in both the expander and the initFunction case, how could the results be different?
2013-10-24T21:16:19 <Bosmon> So you DO actually get an "io" instance in the expadner case, right? It\'s just that in some way it is non-functional?
2013-10-24T21:19:09 * mrvisser joined the channel
2013-10-24T21:21:55 <yzen> yes exactly
2013-10-24T21:22:10 <yzen> this is why i think something like this is messed up or something else
2013-10-24T21:22:17 <yzen> Bosmon:
2013-10-24T21:22:20 <yzen> ^
2013-10-24T21:22:59 <Bosmon> yzen - ok
2013-10-24T21:23:08 <Bosmon> Why does the argument "ioOptions" not appear to be used?
2013-10-24T21:23:25 <yzen> i simplified the function
2013-10-24T21:23:28 <yzen> it is actually used
2013-10-24T21:23:32 <yzen> but has no affect on success
2013-10-24T21:23:41 <Bosmon> ok
2013-10-24T21:24:02 <Bosmon> The only remaining possibility is that somehow "httpServer" is not fully initialised
2013-10-24T21:24:47 <yzen> maybe
2013-10-24T21:24:58 * anastasiac has quit
2013-10-24T21:24:59 <yzen> but it does not say in the docs that it\'s async
2013-10-24T21:25:06 <yzen> would that be ok i use the final init
2013-10-24T21:25:07 <yzen> ?
2013-10-24T21:25:11 <yzen> with the comment ?
2013-10-24T21:25:12 * mrvisser has quit
2013-10-24T21:25:15 <Bosmon> Well, not without understanding the problem, no : P
