2013-10-31T19:00:56 <anastasiac> yzen: is pageBuilder a subcomponent of pageBuilderIO, or vice versa? or neither? Does every page have a page builder, and if so, which one? pageBuilder, or pageBuilderIO?
2013-10-31T19:05:05 <yzen> anastasiac: so pageBuilder is a subcomponent of pageBuilderIO
2013-10-31T19:05:19 <yzen> the latter is just sort of a wrapper that does the IO first
2013-10-31T19:05:49 <anastasiac> yzen, so does every page have a pageBuilderIO?
2013-10-31T19:05:56 <yzen> yes
2013-10-31T19:06:06 <yzen> every page has both
2013-10-31T19:06:35 <anastasiac> but the page has a pageBuilderIO, and the pageBuilderIO has a pageBuilder, right?
2013-10-31T19:07:09 <anastasiac> yzen: ^
2013-10-31T19:07:21 <yzen> yes
2013-10-31T19:07:23 <anastasiac> ok
2013-10-31T19:07:23 <yzen> correct
2013-10-31T19:08:09 <anastasiac> also, yzen, do you have any idea who the audience for this documentation is? is it likely someone setting up their custom cspace installation who's defining their own special pages, and they need to know how to configure the pageBuidlerIO?
2013-10-31T19:08:37 <yzen> probably yes and also the space ui devs
2013-10-31T19:09:13 <anastasiac> finally (for now), yzen, can you remind me how I can play with a working UI using the code checked out on my machine? Do I have to do something special other than check it out and visit a particular page?
2013-10-31T19:09:49 <yzen> demo.collectionspace.org i belive
2013-10-31T19:10:08 <anastasiac> no, I mean using the code I've checked out locally, say if I want to change something
2013-10-31T19:10:49 <anastasiac> yzen, do I need to also run the various other layers, or is there a dev mode I can work in?
2013-10-31T19:12:00 <yzen> no i think you wont
2013-10-31T19:12:28 <yzen> or perhaps app layer
2013-10-31T19:12:33 <yzen> can't remember
2013-10-31T19:12:47 <yzen> i believe there are scripts to start a ui/app layer in the scripts directory
2013-10-31T19:13:47 <anastasiac> ok, I'll look there
2013-10-31T19:14:31 <anastasiac> Um, yzen\xe2\x80\xa6 what scripts directory??
2013-10-31T19:14:57 <yzen> https://github.com/collectionspace/ui/tree/master/src/test/scripts
2013-10-31T19:15:24 <yzen> so yes i think you would need to run app and ui
2013-10-31T19:15:58 <anastasiac> oh, interesting, it's in the test folder. and I need the app layer as well. <sigh>
2013-10-31T19:16:18 <yzen> :)
