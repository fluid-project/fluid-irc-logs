b'2013-10-23T02:44:55 <sgithens> should be on the play store
2013-10-23T02:46:05 <sgithens> I also have a persona that launches atkins text to speech app, but it crashes gpii when you log him out
2013-10-23T02:46:15 <sgithens> so that requires even *more* quick acting
2013-10-23T02:46:20 <sgithens> so you might want to skip it
2013-10-23T02:49:40 <colinclark> ok, so let me get these installed
2013-10-23T02:49:45 <colinclark> and provision a tag for Paulina
2013-10-23T02:49:52 <colinclark> what other personas did you use at Google I/O?
2013-10-23T02:50:21 <sgithens> just those 3
2013-10-23T02:50:29 <sgithens> oh!
2013-10-23T02:50:34 <sgithens> let me send you my cutouts
2013-10-23T02:50:39 <sgithens> just for fun
2013-10-23T02:51:02 <sgithens> I inkscaped greggs word document for i/o and cut them out
2013-10-23T02:51:11 <colinclark> that\'d be great
2013-10-23T02:52:03 <colinclark> and is there any trick to writing the tags?
2013-10-23T02:52:12 <colinclark> Or is it apparent that I just need write a string somewhere?
2013-10-23T02:52:26 <sgithens> right... so
2013-10-23T02:53:03 <sgithens> hit create, write and store
2013-10-23T02:53:11 <sgithens> and do a \'plain text\' one
2013-10-23T02:53:18 <sgithens> with just the name, all lower case
2013-10-23T02:53:35 <sgithens> you can check it with \'view\'
2013-10-23T02:53:52 <colinclark> damn, all these tags are not compatible
2013-10-23T02:53:57 <colinclark> and i\'m a bit afraid to write my rings
2013-10-23T02:54:03 <colinclark> have you ever had a failure?
2013-10-23T02:54:15 <sgithens> no
2013-10-23T02:54:19 <colinclark> ok
2013-10-23T02:54:21 <sgithens> WELL
2013-10-23T02:54:21 <sgithens> wait
2013-10-23T02:54:27 <sgithens> I don\'t know about your rings
2013-10-23T02:54:33 <sgithens> some tags can only be written once
2013-10-23T02:54:48 <sgithens> I don\'t have any, but I know they exist
2013-10-23T02:54:49 <colinclark> it\'s interesting
2013-10-23T02:54:56 <sgithens> well, I guess you wouldn\'t be able to write them then
2013-10-23T02:54:58 <colinclark> the app seems to hate everything i\'ve got
2013-10-23T02:55:01 <sgithens> so it wouldn\'t matter
2013-10-23T02:55:18 <sgithens> what\'s it saying?
2013-10-23T02:55:40 <sgithens> well, you can just flash them the same as on windows
2013-10-23T02:55:52 <colinclark> i\'m using the View feature
2013-10-23T02:56:12 <colinclark> and it says it is "used, blocked, or not supported and cannot contain an NFC data set"
2013-10-23T02:56:24 <sgithens> wild
2013-10-23T02:56:30 <sgithens> I have piles of tags here, and most of them are fine
2013-10-23T02:56:34 <colinclark> let\'s see what this awful windows app does
2013-10-23T02:56:52 <colinclark> FUCK
2013-10-23T02:57:04 <colinclark> "This Android device does not support MIFARE Classic tags"
2013-10-23T02:57:21 <colinclark> hopefully Gregg has some that are compatible with both
2013-10-23T02:58:12 <colinclark> did you use a nexus 7 for your I/O demo?
2013-10-23T02:59:24 <colinclark> I\'m doomed
2013-10-23T02:59:35 <colinclark> it looks like the old Nexus 7 had support for them, but the new one doesn\'t
2013-10-23T02:59:37 <colinclark> nor the Nexus 4
2013-10-23T02:59:52 <colinclark> and I\'m pretty sure the Windows Listener will only read Mifare Classics
2013-10-23T02:59:53 <sgithens> what the hell?
2013-10-23T02:59:57 <sgithens> no mifare tags?
2013-10-23T03:00:34 <sgithens> I have the galaxy nexus from the IDRC
2013-10-23T03:00:45 <sgithens> Also a nexus 7
2013-10-23T03:00:48 <sgithens> They work on both
2013-10-23T03:00:56 <sgithens> *and* on the linux tag reader
2013-10-23T03:01:02 <sgithens> it\'s the same usb tag reader?
2013-10-23T03:01:24 <sgithens> scratch that last line
2013-10-23T03:01:44 <sgithens> wait, I have a nexus 4 as my personal phone
2013-10-23T03:01:46 <sgithens> let me try it
2013-10-23T03:03:06 <sgithens> holy shit
2013-10-23T03:03:13 <sgithens> you\'re right
2013-10-23T03:03:15 <sgithens> wtf
2013-10-23T03:03:32 <colinclark> Ok
2013-10-23T03:03:40 <colinclark> So it looks like they switched to a Broadcom chipset
2013-10-23T03:03:46 <colinclark> that isn\'t compatible with the Mifare Classics
2013-10-23T03:03:56 <colinclark> Gregg says he\'s got a whole whack of tags in his hotel room
2013-10-23T03:04:04 <colinclark> and isn\'t worried if we have different tags for different users
2013-10-23T03:04:07 <sgithens> so you can just make 2 tags for all the personas
2013-10-23T03:04:09 <colinclark> yup
2013-10-23T03:04:11 <colinclark> exactly
2013-10-23T03:04:16 <sgithens> and play magic tricks
2013-10-23T03:04:37 <colinclark> So I\'ve installed the GPII user listener
2013-10-23T03:04:45 <colinclark> do I need to do anything to make it work, assuming I can find a compatible card
2013-10-23T03:04:45 <sgithens> k
2013-10-23T03:04:46 <colinclark> ?
2013-10-23T03:04:56 <sgithens> no, but you def practice
2013-10-23T03:05:07 <sgithens> some oddities include:
2013-10-23T03:05:23 <sgithens> when you log out, it\'s logo might just keep spinning. which is fine, just hit it\'s close button
2013-10-23T03:06:28 <sgithens> also, if anode gives you any shit, hit stop, wait a sec, then, click the window list button on the bottom right of the android screen, and just swipe it to the side to close it, then reopen and restart it
2013-10-23T03:07:46 <colinclark> ok
2013-10-23T03:07:50 <colinclark> that\'s pretty reasonable
2013-10-23T03:08:01 <sgithens> it should actually work pretty good
2013-10-23T03:08:47 <sgithens> after I worked out the kinks on day one, I used it all day 2 and 3 pretty smoothly
2013-10-23T03:09:19 <sgithens> you have to get the timing right on the listener
2013-10-23T03:09:24 <sgithens> you sort of have to hold it for a sec
2013-10-23T03:09:32 <sgithens> the tag that is
2013-10-23T03:09:38 <colinclark> it\'s similar on windows
2013-10-23T03:09:56 <colinclark> you kind of have to lay into it a bit, mentally
2013-10-23T03:10:01 <colinclark> like you\'re playing the piano
2013-10-23T03:10:04 <colinclark> with an RFID tag
2013-10-23T03:10:07 <sgithens> yes
2013-10-23T03:10:09 <sgithens> so....
2013-10-23T03:10:41 <sgithens> I kind of feel like I\'m in NASA mission control, and you guys are in orbit around the moon having technical issues and we\'re trying to fix them from the ground
2013-10-23T03:10:49 <sgithens> this is some serious Apollo 13 stuf
2013-10-23T03:10:55 <sgithens> or whatever that tom hanks movie was
2013-10-23T03:11:27 <sgithens> hopefully you land smoothly on the microsoft campus tomorrow
2013-10-23T03:14:49 <colinclark> you\'re amazing, dude
2013-10-23T03:14:51 <colinclark> I really really appreciate it
2013-10-23T03:15:10 <colinclark> and it wouldn\'t be any fun if it was all smooth landings at microsoft ;)
2013-10-23T03:16:23 <sgithens> :)
2013-10-23T03:16:25 <sgithens> THANK YOU
2013-10-23T03:16:46 <sgithens> I\'m not sure how much longer I\'ll be up, but ping me if you get the tags, I\'ll be anxious to hear if they work :)
2013-10-23T03:16:51 <colinclark> yup
2013-10-23T03:16:53 <colinclark> i\'m just heading over now
2013-10-23T03:17:02 <colinclark> hopefully a walk in the fog will be good, too
2013-10-23T03:17:09 <colinclark> even if i am staying in a mcdonald\'s parking lot

2013-10-23T16:10:47 <sgithens> installing gotomeeting on a new laptop, be there in a sec
2013-10-23T16:11:00 <sgithens> also, off to find a conference room
'

b'2013-10-23T01:50:02 <sgithens> so be sure to uninstall the current GpiiActivity
2013-10-23T01:50:31 <colinclark> how do I do that?
2013-10-23T01:50:40 <colinclark> speaking of dumb questions
2013-10-23T01:50:42 <sgithens> Settings -> Apps
2013-10-23T01:50:52 <sgithens> click on it, and there should be an uninstall button
2013-10-23T01:52:07 <sgithens> also, delete the current javascript
2013-10-23T01:52:09 <sgithens> so
2013-10-23T01:52:11 <sgithens> in a terminal
2013-10-23T01:52:18 <sgithens> adb shell
2013-10-23T01:52:25 <sgithens> > cd sdcard
2013-10-23T01:52:30 <sgithens> > rm -R gpii
2013-10-23T01:52:34 <sgithens> > exit
2013-10-23T01:52:39 <sgithens> then push the code to the device
2013-10-23T01:52:56 <sgithens> adb push gpii-googleio.tar.gz /sdcard/gpii-googleio.tar.gz
2013-10-23T01:52:59 <sgithens> adb shell
2013-10-23T01:53:03 <sgithens> > cd sdcard
2013-10-23T01:53:12 <sgithens> > tar -xzvf ... crap
2013-10-23T01:53:18 <sgithens> you might not have tar
2013-10-23T01:53:36 <sgithens> in that case, use one of the apps javi mentioned to untar/zip it
2013-10-23T01:53:49 <colinclark> I think I do have tar
2013-10-23T01:53:51 <sgithens> so it\'s /sdcard/gpii/stuff
2013-10-23T01:53:52 <colinclark> let me double check
2013-10-23T01:53:54 <sgithens> oh cool
2013-10-23T01:54:00 <colinclark> yeah, busybox installed tar
2013-10-23T01:54:06 <sgithens> perfect
2013-10-23T01:54:12 <sgithens> THEN
2013-10-23T01:54:53 <sgithens> this is probably unnessary, but just so we have the exact same set up
2013-10-23T01:55:20 <sgithens> rename that APK you\'re downloading to:   AnodeActivity.apk
2013-10-23T01:55:27 <colinclark> I\'m still waiting for the tar ball to download
2013-10-23T01:55:32 <colinclark> hopefully it will speed up a bit
2013-10-23T01:55:32 <sgithens> and however you need to, get it in /system/apps
2013-10-23T01:55:47 <colinclark> What a strange world I\'m living in, where Gregg texts me about parties
2013-10-23T01:55:54 <sgithens> HAHAHAHAHA
2013-10-23T01:56:03 <colinclark> I guess you guys drink wine and spin vinyl together
2013-10-23T01:56:22 <sgithens> sorry man, I\'m causing you to miss the fun
2013-10-23T01:57:24 <sgithens> hopefully, this will be the swift kick in the ass I need to finish putting up a binary.  Everytime we do an android demo it turns into this 11th hour stuff, and then for like a week, I\'m hot on finally putting up a good build of it... and then I loose the priority of it.  And then this happens again
2013-10-23T01:57:52 <colinclark> no no, this party hasn\'t started yet
2013-10-23T01:57:57 <colinclark> plus, this is more fun ;)
2013-10-23T01:58:16 <colinclark> and you shouldn\'t feel bad about this
2013-10-23T01:58:29 <colinclark> the windows demo is completely mess up as well
2013-10-23T01:58:35 <colinclark> took me something like 8 hours to get it all working
2013-10-23T01:58:47 <colinclark> we have a habit of committing code to master that doesn\'t work
2013-10-23T01:59:23 <sgithens> Actually, I think that\'s part of the problem, is that we\'re always trying to demo off of master instead of reliable tags
2013-10-23T01:59:47 <sgithens> I mean, *yes* we should commit working code to master, but I wouldn\'t expect it to work all the time for a major demo
2013-10-23T02:00:02 <colinclark> yeah
2013-10-23T02:00:05 <sgithens> if we could make reliable tags just a little more often
2013-10-23T02:00:07 <colinclark> yes
2013-10-23T02:00:10 <colinclark> I agree with you
2013-10-23T02:00:32 <colinclark> Hey, do you know how one might boil water for tea in a hotel room percolator coffee machine?
2013-10-23T02:00:45 <sgithens> yeah
2013-10-23T02:00:46 <colinclark> there must be a way, judging by these tea bags left here for me to use
2013-10-23T02:00:53 <sgithens> just run the water through it
2013-10-23T02:00:57 <colinclark> ok
2013-10-23T02:00:59 <sgithens> without anything in the filter basket
2013-10-23T02:01:03 <colinclark> cool
2013-10-23T02:01:41 <sgithens> ok
2013-10-23T02:01:53 <sgithens> I need to find you this nfc listener apk now
2013-10-23T02:02:13 <sgithens> it\'s going to be a little wierd, but once you get used to it, you can demo it with a slight of hand
2013-10-23T02:02:17 <sgithens> like a magician
2013-10-23T02:02:17 <colinclark> ok
2013-10-23T02:02:19 <colinclark> :)
2013-10-23T02:02:29 <sgithens> it just, it pops up a screen still
2013-10-23T02:02:35 <sgithens> so I just close it really quick
2013-10-23T02:02:44 <sgithens> whenever you touch a tag it pops up a screen
2013-10-23T02:05:32 <colinclark> So, I won\'t dab install this apk
2013-10-23T02:05:47 <colinclark> but, rather, push it onto /sdcard and then get it in /system/apps?
2013-10-23T02:05:50 <colinclark> is that correct?
2013-10-23T02:07:01 <sgithens> yes
2013-10-23T02:07:14 <sgithens> using whatever means necessary!
2013-10-23T02:07:32 <sgithens> if you have to crack it open and use a soldering iron to get the bits in the system parition then so be it
2013-10-23T02:08:17 <colinclark> :)
2013-10-23T02:09:29 <sgithens> so, with kettle now, do we use much of node other than serving http and reading files off the filesystem?
2013-10-23T02:09:52 <sgithens> I\'ve been thinking a lot about running it with something like cordova ever since you mentioned that a few months ago
2013-10-23T02:10:39 <colinclark> Not a lot more than serving http and reading files at the moment
2013-10-23T02:10:48 <colinclark> ok, it\'s now in place
2013-10-23T02:10:54 <colinclark> es explorer is hot
2013-10-23T02:10:54 <sgithens> awesome
2013-10-23T02:11:00 <colinclark> and the water is boiled
2013-10-23T02:11:06 <sgithens> great
2013-10-23T02:11:07 <colinclark> you are a man of many talents
2013-10-23T02:11:11 <sgithens> did you reboot?
2013-10-23T02:11:12 <sgithens> ha
2013-10-23T02:11:58 <sgithens> until I find this nfc listener, try logging in as \'maguro\'
2013-10-23T02:12:30 <sgithens> with chrome
2013-10-23T02:13:14 <colinclark> rebooting now
2013-10-23T02:16:24 <colinclark> So I see that the apk is installed in /system/app
2013-10-23T02:16:34 <colinclark> but I don\'t actually see the app on the phone
2013-10-23T02:16:50 <sgithens> do you see an app called \'Anode\'
2013-10-23T02:17:38 <colinclark> no
2013-10-23T02:17:44 <sgithens> really?
2013-10-23T02:18:22 <colinclark> really
2013-10-23T02:18:33 <colinclark> if I tap on the api in ES Explorer, it says that there was a problem parsing the package
2013-10-23T02:18:47 <colinclark> whereas other apps seem to attempt to install themselves when I do so
2013-10-23T02:18:52 <colinclark> I wonder if the .apk is malformed somehow
2013-10-23T02:18:56 <sgithens> hmm
2013-10-23T02:19:15 <sgithens> : md5sum GoogleIOAnodeActivity.apk
2013-10-23T02:19:15 <sgithens> 4ce98f7258adb53d214cc7ed932a1fb3  GoogleIOAnodeActivity.apk
2013-10-23T02:19:30 <sgithens> my android has md5sum installed
2013-10-23T02:19:39 <sgithens> not sure if the stock images do
2013-10-23T02:19:58 <colinclark> I\'ve got it too
2013-10-23T02:20:02 <colinclark> different checksum
2013-10-23T02:20:04 <colinclark> let me reinstall it
2013-10-23T02:20:08 <sgithens> ugh
2013-10-23T02:20:14 <sgithens> k
2013-10-23T02:20:26 <sgithens> brb
2013-10-23T02:21:51 <sgithens> When you get a sec, grab this too: https://github.com/sgithens/gpii-android-test/blob/master/net.gpii.android.listener-1.apk?raw=true
2013-10-23T02:21:55 <sgithens> back in 10 minutes
2013-10-23T02:35:06 <colinclark> So I\'ve had moderate success
2013-10-23T02:35:20 <colinclark> I accidentally logged in as Sammy and it changed my font size
2013-10-23T02:35:30 <colinclark> which is more than I can say about Windows right now :)
2013-10-23T02:35:47 <colinclark> I\'m just trying with Maguro
2013-10-23T02:37:16 <colinclark> Maguro seems to work, but has roughly the same effect as Sammy
2013-10-23T02:37:29 <colinclark> should he start Talkback?
2013-10-23T02:40:26 <sgithens> AWESOME
2013-10-23T02:40:28 <sgithens> no
2013-10-23T02:40:35 <sgithens> talkback is...
2013-10-23T02:40:44 <sgithens> jas
2013-10-23T02:41:09 <sgithens> talkback is \'paulina\'
2013-10-23T02:41:35 <colinclark> HOLY!
2013-10-23T02:41:39 <sgithens> :)
2013-10-23T02:41:40 <colinclark> she just said
2013-10-23T02:41:50 <colinclark> "Ring tone volume set to 40 percent"
2013-10-23T02:41:53 <sgithens> :)
2013-10-23T02:41:55 <sgithens> Sweet!
2013-10-23T02:42:01 <sgithens> THis is totally going to work for you tomorrow
2013-10-23T02:42:08 <sgithens> this is great
2013-10-23T02:42:22 <colinclark> STEVE
2013-10-23T02:42:23 <colinclark> YOU RULE
2013-10-23T02:42:26 <sgithens> can you log them out too?
2013-10-23T02:42:28 <colinclark> RULE RULE RULE
2013-10-23T02:42:28 <colinclark> yup
2013-10-23T02:42:36 <sgithens> great!
2013-10-23T02:42:41 <sgithens> did you try the tag reader yet?
2013-10-23T02:42:52 <colinclark> I seemed to have some crashiness with Sammy
2013-10-23T02:42:52 <colinclark> but it might well be that he was just not intended for this
2013-10-23T02:43:06 <colinclark> not yet
2013-10-23T02:43:07 <colinclark> does it need to go into /system/app?
2013-10-23T02:43:11 <sgithens> no
2013-10-23T02:43:15 <sgithens> it\'s a regular app
2013-10-23T02:43:19 <sgithens> you can just adb install it
2013-10-23T02:43:34 <colinclark> wicked
2013-10-23T02:43:34 <sgithens> and again, you have to get used to the timing on it
2013-10-23T02:43:39 <colinclark> ok
2013-10-23T02:43:39 <sgithens> you\'ll be acting a bit for the demo
2013-10-23T02:43:42 <colinclark> what writer app do you use?
2013-10-23T02:43:56 <colinclark> my guess is that Gregg will do the demo ;)
2013-10-23T02:44:05 <sgithens> on android I use TagWriter
2013-10-23T02:44:14 <sgithens> ok, well you\'ll have to coach him then
2013-10-23T02:44:31 <sgithens> like you\'re prepping him for a keynote or something
2013-10-23T02:44:51 <sgithens> NFC TagWriter by NXP Advanced Features
'

b'2013-10-23T00:07:08 <sgithens> which method did you use to root it?  Is it still running the stock android distro or did you install like cyanogenmod?
2013-10-23T00:08:49 <colinclark> I tried cyanogenmod, but it turned out to be a bit of a mess
2013-10-23T00:09:02 <colinclark> The keyboard would crash on startup, which made it somewhat inconvenient to use :)
2013-10-23T00:09:27 <colinclark> So I used the basic instructions from Cyanogenmod, then went back to the stock Google images of 4.3
2013-10-23T00:09:34 <sgithens> yeah, I often run into stability issues sometimes when I update my cyanogenmod release :)
2013-10-23T00:09:38 <colinclark> then tossed SuperSU on, and I think that was it
2013-10-23T00:09:59 <colinclark> So I used ClockworkMod Recovery
2013-10-23T00:10:18 <sgithens> are the google images always on the device or did you have to go fetch them?
2013-10-23T00:10:19 <colinclark> brb
2013-10-23T00:10:24 <sgithens> no worries
2013-10-23T00:10:27 <colinclark> I had to fetch them
2013-10-23T00:10:36 <colinclark> I still don\'t quite know what made my phone so hard to root
2013-10-23T00:10:41 <sgithens> I\'m just realizing though that I never actually rooted my nexus 7
2013-10-23T00:10:49 <colinclark> but my theory is that they encrypt the sdcard voume
2013-10-23T00:10:52 <colinclark> volume
2013-10-23T00:11:02 <colinclark> Once I reformatted /data and /sdcard with ClockworkMod, I was fine
2013-10-23T00:11:05 <sgithens> you\'re on a nexus 7 right?
2013-10-23T00:11:12 <colinclark> I\'ve got a 4 with me right now, actually
2013-10-23T00:11:18 <sgithens> ooh
2013-10-23T00:11:21 <colinclark> I was going to bring the 7, but this was easier
2013-10-23T00:11:28 <colinclark> is that really bad?
2013-10-23T00:11:59 <sgithens> I should maybe reinstall the official iso\'s on the smaller one too
2013-10-23T00:12:16 <sgithens> I don\'t think it\'s bad  :)
2013-10-23T00:12:45 <sgithens> I just wanted to test on the same thing you were using... and now I\'ve realized none of them are really set up the same
2013-10-23T00:13:14 <sgithens> but cyanogenmod *has* been giving me issues lately, so I should go back to the google images
2013-10-23T00:13:35 <sgithens> thank goodness Javi is working on this stuff now too
2013-10-23T00:13:45 <sgithens> he\'s really sorted a lot of it out
2013-10-23T00:14:23 <colinclark> i\'m excited about it, too
2013-10-23T00:15:20 <sgithens> how long are you in seattle for?
2013-10-23T00:15:45 <colinclark> just two days
2013-10-23T00:15:53 <colinclark> and unfortunately i\'m in the \'burbs
2013-10-23T00:15:55 <colinclark> but it\'s nice here
2013-10-23T00:16:00 <colinclark> really great fall colours
2013-10-23T00:19:20 <colinclark> sgithens: Do you know if there\'s a way to force our ant script to use a different version of the Android build tools?
2013-10-23T00:19:37 <colinclark> I have version 18.1 installed, but they seem to depend on 17
2013-10-23T00:19:43 <colinclark> so I also downloaded 17
2013-10-23T00:19:54 <colinclark> but I\'m still getting "/Applications/adt-bundle-mac-x86_64-20130917/sdk/tools/ant/build.xml:542: Unable to resolve project target \'android-17\'"
2013-10-23T00:20:32 <sgithens> um, I think you\'d have to change your path and the ANDROID_HOME env
2013-10-23T00:20:56 <sgithens> you could just try searching/replacing the android-17 and update it
2013-10-23T00:21:06 <sgithens> if you want to use the new one
2013-10-23T00:21:12 <sgithens> which might work :)
2013-10-23T00:21:23 <colinclark> it\'s worth a shot :)
2013-10-23T00:26:39 <colinclark> I\'m getting an error related to missing references to jtar, sgithens
2013-10-23T00:26:42 <colinclark> is this at all familiar?
2013-10-23T00:28:15 <sgithens> um, jas
2013-10-23T00:30:25 <sgithens> I think I see the problem
2013-10-23T00:30:34 <sgithens> do this:
2013-10-23T00:30:43 <sgithens> mkdir app/libs/
2013-10-23T00:30:45 <sgithens> cp anode/app/contrib/jtar-1.0.4.jar app/libs/
2013-10-23T00:33:06 <colinclark> seems happier now
2013-10-23T00:33:08 <colinclark> let\'s see how it goes :)
2013-10-23T00:33:09 <colinclark> yup, it compiled
2013-10-23T00:33:09 <colinclark> you rule
2013-10-23T00:33:31 <sgithens> Actually, I see an extra check we need to put it in our build scripts now :)
2013-10-23T00:33:34 <sgithens> for that
2013-10-23T00:35:46 <colinclark> Gregg phoned a few minutes ago
2013-10-23T00:36:00 <colinclark> he was sort of freaking when I told him I wasn\'t 100% sure I\'d have it working
2013-10-23T00:36:09 <colinclark> but I think it should be okay
2013-10-23T00:36:10 <colinclark> there\'s time
2013-10-23T00:36:16 <colinclark> the meeting isn\'t until tomorrow afternoon
2013-10-23T00:36:38 <colinclark> it\'s just pulling down universal over a very slow hotel network now
2013-10-23T00:36:52 <sgithens> yeah, I think we can get this
2013-10-23T00:36:55 <sgithens> Oh yeah
2013-10-23T00:37:00 <sgithens> that\'s another thing we should fix
2013-10-23T00:37:12 <sgithens> for all the platforms
2013-10-23T00:37:26 <sgithens> pulling down the entire universal everytime is crippling
2013-10-23T00:37:39 <sgithens> if we can rebase it for the build scripts, or whatever the git-ish way to do it is
2013-10-23T00:38:16 <colinclark> yes
2013-10-23T00:38:20 <colinclark> I think that makes sense
2013-10-23T00:39:04 <sgithens> has anyone tried out the github \'releases\' stuff
2013-10-23T00:39:24 <sgithens> we need to throw up a binary version of this once someone has a really good build of it, tested on a few models
2013-10-23T00:40:44 <sgithens> what\'s your plan for demoing on the android tomorrow?  Are you going to install it in /sys/app to start/stop talkback?
2013-10-23T00:41:23 <colinclark> I guess so
2013-10-23T00:41:27 <colinclark> is that what I should be doing?
2013-10-23T00:41:32 <colinclark> Honestly, I know so little about this stuff
2013-10-23T00:41:38 <colinclark> I feel a bit out of the loop in general
2013-10-23T00:42:15 <sgithens> With just a rooted device you can make the font bigger/smaller
2013-10-23T00:42:31 <sgithens> you have to literally install it in the system area though if you want to start stop talkback
2013-10-23T00:42:33 <colinclark> what do I need to do to get system privileges?
2013-10-23T00:42:40 <colinclark> I think talkback would be much more effective to demonstrate
2013-10-23T00:42:58 <sgithens> that\'s a different directory, where only the core apps live
2013-10-23T00:43:24 <sgithens> or you can sign your apk with an android cert
2013-10-23T00:43:32 <sgithens> but I\'ve yet to find the special cert to use
2013-10-23T00:43:44 <sgithens> for talkback
2013-10-23T00:43:57 <colinclark> Do I need to do anything special to install it in /sys/app?
2013-10-23T00:44:03 <sgithens> also, I\'m honestly a little out of th eloop too, Javi may have all kinds of other cool demoable stuff
2013-10-23T00:44:12 <sgithens> my demo\'s are old hat now :p
2013-10-23T00:44:25 <colinclark> :)
2013-10-23T00:45:11 <sgithens> you either need to remount /sys to be rw, and do it over the command line, or use an app like ES Explorere that will let you remount it, and then copy it over with it\'s GUI
2013-10-23T00:45:16 <sgithens> then you have to restart the device
2013-10-23T00:45:53 <sgithens> the issue is that the a11y services have so many perms, that it\'s not even good enough to be root on the device to run them
2013-10-23T00:46:12 <sgithens> honestly, it\'s kind of a hot mess
2013-10-23T00:46:30 <colinclark> which command line do I need to do it over? the adb shell or something?
2013-10-23T00:47:21 <sgithens> I\'ve always used ES File Explorer to copy it.  Though i need to go dig up javi\'s email, as he wrote out the command to remount the sys filesystem as r/w
2013-10-23T00:54:26 <colinclark> Wow, I\'ve just got the "Hello World, GpiiActivity" message on my phone
2013-10-23T00:54:45 <colinclark> I guess the key question now is, "now what?
2013-10-23T00:54:51 <colinclark> that seems to be the end of the tutorial
2013-10-23T00:56:03 <sgithens> did you get it by running the android-gpii.sh start ?
2013-10-23T00:56:31 <colinclark> yup
2013-10-23T00:56:56 <sgithens> can you run \'adb logcat\'
2013-10-23T00:57:02 <sgithens> and see if you see the node startup output?
2013-10-23T00:57:50 <colinclark> yup
2013-10-23T00:58:03 <sgithens> holy shit, really?  that\'s great
2013-10-23T00:58:48 <sgithens> this is going to be aweful, but see if you can load the standard localhost:8080/user/someone/login ?
2013-10-23T00:59:11 <colinclark> I don\'t see it, no
2013-10-23T00:59:12 <colinclark> sorry
2013-10-23T00:59:50 <colinclark> I mean, I don\'t see node starting up
2013-10-23T01:02:17 <colinclark> yeah, there\'s definitely no node server running on the device :(
2013-10-23T01:02:20 <colinclark> bummer
2013-10-23T01:03:33 <sgithens> what are you seeing in logcat?
2013-10-23T01:08:24 * yzen joined the channel
2013-10-23T01:08:42 <sgithens> this might be a little lame, but I might just try and find my apk\'s from google i/o and send them to you.  I demo\'d them for 2 days straight so I know they work.   If there is time then we can try to get master working for you again, but just in case
2013-10-23T01:08:46 <sgithens> hopefully I can find them
2013-10-23T01:09:39 <sgithens> other than everything javi added, the functionality is mostly the same (or at least the functionality I know about)
2013-10-23T01:10:21 <colinclark> That sounds like a good plan, just in case
2013-10-23T01:10:31 <colinclark> thanks, sgithens
2013-10-23T01:10:34 <colinclark> I really appreciate it
2013-10-23T01:24:48 <colinclark> sgithens: This is the logcat output I get when I start the system with android-gpii.sh start
2013-10-23T01:24:49 <colinclark> http://pastie.org/8422872
2013-10-23T01:25:25 <colinclark> But I never see any reference to the FlowManager or anything else starting up
2013-10-23T01:25:49 <colinclark> and Chrome sadly tells met that there\'s nothing running at localhost:8081 when I try to log in as sammy
2013-10-23T01:27:25 <colinclark> it\'s weird; anode seems to run but just exits immediately
2013-10-23T01:31:29 <sgithens> I\'ve seen that before, it\'s usually what happens when there is an issue loading node extensions.  It just fails silently.
2013-10-23T01:31:49 <sgithens> I thought it was a bad bug, but apparently on all platforms, node just fails silently if it fails to load an extension
2013-10-23T01:31:55 <sgithens> I\'m testing out this apk now
2013-10-23T01:33:06 <colinclark> ok
2013-10-23T01:41:45 <sgithens> colinclark: Ok, this demo still works like a charm
2013-10-23T01:42:15 <sgithens> If you haven\'t yet, grab ES File Explorer off the play store
2013-10-23T01:42:32 <sgithens> or, anything else to transfer files to /system and remount it
2013-10-23T01:42:38 <sgithens> it\'s still the only thing I\'ve used
2013-10-23T01:43:13 <sgithens> Also, I need to get you the apk for the tag listener
2013-10-23T01:43:24 <sgithens> I need to chat with javi about that too
2013-10-23T01:43:32 <sgithens> I think someone might be hacking on it
2013-10-23T01:46:00 <colinclark> I grabbed it while I was waiting
2013-10-23T01:46:12 <colinclark> oh yes
2013-10-23T01:46:15 <colinclark> the tag listener
2013-10-23T01:47:28 <sgithens> hey
2013-10-23T01:47:30 <sgithens> cool
2013-10-23T01:47:38 <sgithens> so, let me get these URL\'s for you
2013-10-23T01:47:46 <sgithens> dumb question, but you already have talkback installed right?
2013-10-23T01:47:58 <colinclark> ok, great
2013-10-23T01:48:46 <sgithens> get this:  https://github.com/sgithens/gpii-android-test/blob/master/gpii-googleio.tar.gz?raw=true
2013-10-23T01:49:03 <colinclark> I think I probably do, but I don\'t know for sure
2013-10-23T01:49:10 <sgithens> and this: https://github.com/sgithens/gpii-android-test/blob/master/GoogleIOAnodeActivity.apk?raw=true
2013-10-23T01:49:28 <sgithens> It would show up under: Settings -> Accessibility -> Services
2013-10-23T01:49:38 <sgithens> just like listed under services
2013-10-23T01:49:42 <colinclark> yup, I do
2013-10-23T01:49:46 <colinclark> have talkbalk
2013-10-23T01:49:47 <sgithens> cool
2013-10-23T01:49:52 <sgithens> right
