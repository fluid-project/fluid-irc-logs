2013-08-26T21:27:50 <yzen> hi Bosmon
2013-08-26T21:31:57 <Bosmon> yzen!
2013-08-26T21:32:15 <yzen> Bosmon: so I\'m trying out the wrapper removal in kettle
2013-08-26T21:32:16 <Bosmon> ZENE\'EVICH!
2013-08-26T21:32:21 <Bosmon> yzen - excellent
2013-08-26T21:32:34 <yzen> all my tests pass but one
2013-08-26T21:32:47 <Bosmon> Very promising
2013-08-26T21:33:00 <yzen> Bosmon: this reference does not get resolved : https://github.com/fluid-project/kettle/blob/master/lib/dataSource.js#L67
2013-08-26T21:33:19 <yzen> you can see the relation to data source within this component and the one above (the data source itself)
2013-08-26T21:34:17 <Bosmon> yzen - don\'t see any reason it shouldn\'t be resolved
2013-08-26T21:34:19 <Bosmon> Might well be a bug
2013-08-26T21:34:48 <yzen> Bosmon: exact error: Assertion failure (see console.log for expanded message): Failed to resolve reference {kettle.dataSource}.options.responseParser - could not match context with name kettle.dataSource from component leaf ,[object Object]
2013-08-26T21:35:11 <yzen> it;s a little bit complicated though
2013-08-26T21:35:19 <Bosmon> yzen - that looks like a different site
2013-08-26T21:35:23 <Bosmon> I thought we were looking at modelParser
2013-08-26T21:35:23 <yzen> because i m using a promiseDataSource that has kettle.dataSource grade
2013-08-26T21:35:54 <yzen> no
2013-08-26T21:35:54 <yzen> data source
2013-08-26T21:35:54 <yzen> which it\'s parent comopnent
2013-08-26T21:36:07 <Bosmon> You highlighted line 67
2013-08-26T21:36:10 <Bosmon> Which is inside modelParser
2013-08-26T21:38:20 <yzen> Bosmon: yes but the reference is to a data source compnent
2013-08-26T21:38:35 <yzen> now imagine if data source component is used as a grade
2013-08-26T21:38:41 <yzen> that\'s when it fails
2013-08-26T21:38:51 <Bosmon> Well ok - perhaps it would be better to see the example rather than imagining :)
2013-08-26T21:40:17 <Bosmon> Anyway, "I see no reason why this shouldn\'t work" .... it may well be a bug of some kind
