2013-11-01T13:47:22 <anastasiac> hi, fouks_f, I can certainly try
2013-11-01T13:49:48 <fouks_f> i need to be able to change the volume without using the interface and I am a bit confused by the code
2013-11-01T13:49:58 <fouks_f> could you tell me how to do it ?
2013-11-01T13:50:23 <fouks_f> and also is changing the css properties the only way to change the size of it ?

2013-11-01T15:02:41 <anastasiac> sorry, I'm on a call right now, give me a few minutes
2013-11-01T15:04:10 <fouks_f> okat
2013-11-01T15:04:13 <fouks_f> okay*
2013-11-01T15:09:11 <anastasiac> hi, fouks_f, sorry about that. When you say change the volume without using the interface, can you elaborate a bit what you mean? Do you mean programmatically? What is your use case?

2013-11-01T15:23:08 <fouks_f> anastasiac, yes I mean programmatically, i have a different button for changing the volume and i want the interaction with it to affect the video player
2013-11-01T15:24:30 <anastasiac> hm, ok, let me think about how would be the best way to do that. Regarding your question about CSS: I think the answer is yes, CSS is how the appearance of the control is defined.
2013-11-01T15:24:55 <anastasiac> foulks_f, is your volume button elsewhere on the page, or are you adding it to the videoPlayer's controls?

2013-11-01T15:35:33 <anastasiac> fouks_f, that's an interesting use case, one we didn't consider. I might have to think about that a bit :-) I'll check in with cindyli, one of the other developers for the videoPlayer. She and I should be able to review the code and determine the best way to accomplish your goal
2013-11-01T15:36:14 <fouks_f> thank you very much :)
