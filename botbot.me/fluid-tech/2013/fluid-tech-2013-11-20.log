b'2013-11-20T21:49:00 * clown has left the channel
2013-11-20T21:51:37 * anvk has quit
2013-11-20T21:55:51 <Bosmon> It looks like it is overridden by a component with the same member name from config2
2013-11-20T21:55:55 <Bosmon> Was that not what you intended?
2013-11-20T22:00:04 <yzen> ya i think i misnamed it
2013-11-20T22:00:05 <yzen> let me try
2013-11-20T22:01:46 <yzen> hmm
2013-11-20T22:01:53 <yzen> not sure i understand how it\'s overwritten
2013-11-20T22:04:42 <Bosmon> They both have a subcomponent named "subcomponent1"
2013-11-20T22:05:35 <yzen> yes
2013-11-20T22:05:36 <yzen> well ok
2013-11-20T22:05:55 <yzen> config1 includes config2 and config3
2013-11-20T22:06:11 <yzen> config2 and config3 are correctly resolved imo
2013-11-20T22:06:23 <yzen> one has options: {
2013-11-20T22:06:24 <yzen> gradeNames: ["kettle.tests.subcomponent3"]
2013-11-20T22:06:24 <yzen> }
2013-11-20T22:06:26 <yzen> and the other
2013-11-20T22:06:29 <yzen> options: {
2013-11-20T22:06:30 <yzen> gradeNames: ["kettle.tests.subcomponent2"]
2013-11-20T22:06:31 <yzen> }
2013-11-20T22:06:50 <yzen> you are saying they are overridden? but what i need is combined instead
2013-11-20T22:07:18 <Bosmon> These are subcomponent options, not direct options
2013-11-20T22:07:27 <Bosmon> So yes, the effect is to override the entire subcomponent definition
2013-11-20T22:08:15 <yzen> well how would you suggest i should get out of this ?
2013-11-20T22:08:54 <Bosmon> I suggest you draw up distributeOptions blocks, rather than trying to have "pointy configuration" which reaches directly far down into the tree
2013-11-20T22:09:03 <Bosmon> You seemed to be on the point of doing this earlier in the week anyway
2013-11-20T22:09:53 <yzen> yes but i was getting the same issue
2013-11-20T22:09:59 <yzen> they were overridden
2013-11-20T22:10:09 <yzen> that was in my pasties with the test case and examples
2013-11-20T22:10:20 <Bosmon> Yes, you had given each one of them the same name
2013-11-20T22:10:26 <Bosmon> So they were overriding again
2013-11-20T22:10:39 <Bosmon> They all attached to configuration named "grades" as I recall
2013-11-20T22:10:43 <Bosmon> For which you had written no mergePolicy
2013-11-20T22:11:10 <yzen> right
2013-11-20T22:11:19 <yzen> so you are suggesting i name them differently or write a merge policy ?
2013-11-20T22:11:38 <Bosmon> Yes, one or the other
2013-11-20T22:13:26 <yzen> haha well i prefer the merge policy to be honest to normalize the approach among the number of configs
2013-11-20T22:13:30 <yzen> what do you think ?
2013-11-20T22:13:38 <yzen> so in this case my configLoader is fine ?
2013-11-20T22:14:20 <Bosmon> I think it looks ok, yes... I\'m wondering about the effect that it produces a typeName that doesn\'t actually agree with the one in the file
2013-11-20T22:14:51 <Bosmon> That is, it puts the guid on the end
2013-11-20T22:15:04 <Bosmon> When I suggested that, I had been imagining that you weren\'t actually interested in what the typeName was
2013-11-20T22:15:06 <yzen> it\'s is only if the on in the file is missing
2013-11-20T22:15:08 <yzen> for example
2013-11-20T22:15:09 <Bosmon> But it appears that it is encoded in the file
2013-11-20T22:15:10 <Bosmon> Oh ok
2013-11-20T22:15:11 * mrvisser joined the channel
2013-11-20T22:15:16 <yzen> i only have includes
2013-11-20T22:15:19 <Bosmon> That\'s fine
2013-11-20T22:15:21 <yzen> cool
2013-11-20T22:17:03 <yzen> so i guess you can review it again :) (gpii-75)
2013-11-20T22:18:39 <yzen> i guess the naming is still hanging
2013-11-20T22:18:48 <yzen> how long do you think we should wait for anyone to weight in ?

2013-11-20T21:22:49 <yzen> so Bosmon can we talk about the correct way of merging configs one more time ?
2013-11-20T21:23:51 <Bosmon> Hi yzen
2013-11-20T21:25:45 <yzen> hi, so my first approach was to for each included config to create a component (use fluid.defaults) and to add that grade to the config component that includes it
2013-11-20T21:25:54 <yzen> but i got that issue with grade merging
2013-11-20T21:26:11 <yzen> it was a recursive process
2013-11-20T21:26:26 <Bosmon> yzen - describe this issue!
2013-11-20T21:26:42 <yzen> sure
2013-11-20T21:26:46 <yzen> let me paste my impl
2013-11-20T21:26:49 <Bosmon> Thanks
2013-11-20T21:26:56 <yzen> http://pastie.org/8496520
2013-11-20T21:27:35 <yzen> so with this implementation some of the grades defined in different configs for config subcomponents are not merged entirely
2013-11-20T21:28:15 <yzen> ill try to sketch the situation
2013-11-20T21:28:39 <yzen> config1 -> subcomponent -> grade1 includes config2
2013-11-20T21:29:01 <yzen> config2 -> subcomponent -> grade2 includes config3
2013-11-20T21:29:11 <yzen> config3 -> subcomponent -> grade3
2013-11-20T21:29:27 <yzen> so i would expect when all components are created that subcomponent has all 3 grades
2013-11-20T21:29:30 <yzen> which it does not
2013-11-20T21:29:35 <yzen> the way it\'s assembled is
2013-11-20T21:29:46 <yzen> config 1 -> gradenames = [config2, config3]
2013-11-20T21:31:00 <yzen> sorry rather
2013-11-20T21:31:16 <yzen> config 1 -> gradenames = [config2] -> gradenames = [config3]
2013-11-20T21:31:22 <Bosmon> Ok
2013-11-20T21:31:32 <Bosmon> It might help to see this configuration fleshed out a bit more
2013-11-20T21:31:39 <Bosmon> When you say "grade1 includes config2"
2013-11-20T21:31:42 <Bosmon> How exactly does it do this?
2013-11-20T21:32:10 <yzen> sure so you can sort of see it from that function
2013-11-20T21:32:13 <yzen> we read the config file
2013-11-20T21:32:23 <yzen> declare defaults for it
2013-11-20T21:32:27 <yzen> with some name
2013-11-20T21:32:33 <yzen> that name is passed back to the parent config
2013-11-20T21:32:43 <yzen> and pushed into parent config\'s gradeNames array defaults
2013-11-20T21:33:40 <Bosmon> Could you show me a reference to a sample file, including the "modules" entry etc?
2013-11-20T21:33:53 <yzen> sure
2013-11-20T21:34:40 <yzen> actually this
2013-11-20T21:34:41 <yzen> https://github.com/yzen/kettle/blob/GPII-75/test/ConfigLoaderTests.js#L48-L63
2013-11-20T21:34:44 <yzen> i have a test there
2013-11-20T21:35:08 <yzen> and here are configs and
2013-11-20T21:35:12 <yzen> https://github.com/yzen/kettle/tree/GPII-75/test/configs
2013-11-20T21:35:30 <yzen> you can sort of see that something is missing here https://github.com/yzen/kettle/blob/GPII-75/test/ConfigLoaderTests.js#L56
2013-11-20T21:35:32 <yzen> a grade
2013-11-20T21:37:38 <Bosmon> Ok
2013-11-20T21:37:56 <Bosmon> It seems that two things are being mixed up here - i) inclusion structure, and ii) grade hierarchy
2013-11-20T21:38:19 <Bosmon> So when you say "includes", it seems you mean that, as well as including the relevant file, you intend its contents to be applied as a supergrade of the current grade
2013-11-20T21:41:04 <Bosmon> So what are the effects of running the tests?
2013-11-20T21:41:12 <Bosmon> What do you get as the defaults for "config1"?
2013-11-20T21:42:07 * cindyli has quit
2013-11-20T21:45:12 <yzen> well what\'s there passes because one grade is not included
2013-11-20T21:45:34 <yzen> but as far as i understand it might be necessary for it to be there
2013-11-20T21:46:04 <Bosmon> Which grade is not included?
2013-11-20T21:48:08 <yzen> "kettle.tests.subcomponent2" from config3
