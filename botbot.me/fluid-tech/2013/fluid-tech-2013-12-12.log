2013-12-12T18:18:31 <yzen> hah, i can\'t compare the two
2013-12-12T18:18:34 <yzen> but i did like the house

2013-12-12T19:30:47 <yzen> colinclark, Bosmon ping
2013-12-12T19:31:03 <colinclark> Hi
2013-12-12T19:31:13 <yzen> is there a capability to match solutions to preferences ?
2013-12-12T19:31:28 <colinclark> You mean a matchmaker?
2013-12-12T19:31:37 <yzen> well i can describe my problem
2013-12-12T19:31:43 <yzen> so the user wants to update the prefs
2013-12-12T19:31:43 <colinclark> thanks, that will help
2013-12-12T19:31:50 <yzen> it sends a set of prefernces
2013-12-12T19:31:58 <yzen> the framework then matches them to solutions
2013-12-12T19:32:11 <colinclark> "it" being something like the PMT?
2013-12-12T19:32:15 <yzen> yes
2013-12-12T19:32:23 <yzen> and the lifecycle tries to set them or not in case if it needs restart
2013-12-12T19:32:36 <colinclark> yes
2013-12-12T19:32:49 <yzen> but at that point i know if the solution was applied or not , but i need to report to the user which preferences did not the solutions
2013-12-12T19:35:58 <yzen> colinclark: i understand i can infer from the solution which prefs there were based on capabilities block, but it\'s not necessarily a 1 to 1
2013-12-12T19:37:03 <colinclark> one sec, sorry
2013-12-12T19:41:24 <colinclark> yzen: Your second last sentence, I think, is missing a word
2013-12-12T19:41:31 <colinclark> so I don\'t fully understand
2013-12-12T19:41:36 <colinclark> "i need to report to the user which preferences did not the solutions"
2013-12-12T19:45:08 <yzen> colinclark: nevermind :)
2013-12-12T19:45:20 <colinclark> bummer :(
2013-12-12T19:45:35 <colinclark> did you figure it out?
2013-12-12T19:45:49 <yzen> colinclark: michelled did
2013-12-12T19:45:57 <colinclark> michelled: What\'d you figure out?
2013-12-12T19:49:29 <michelled> yzen drew a picture on the whiteboard - he was concerned about the situation where a single preference maps to two capabilities in a solution
2013-12-12T19:50:09 * yzen has quit
2013-12-12T19:53:08 <michelled> but as he talked through it, he realized that he can filter out what he is not interested in. I didn\'t get all the details of his concern from him, but I think it was related to displaying confusing setting on the UI for the user

2013-12-12T21:09:15 <Bosmon7> Hi yzen
2013-12-12T21:09:23 <Bosmon7> You had a question about capabilities transformations
2013-12-12T21:09:29 <yzen> Bosmon: so I\'m need to keep the capabilities block when doing the transformation
2013-12-12T21:09:46 <yzen> Bosmon7: i need it so i could map from solutions back to preferences
2013-12-12T21:11:09 <Bosmon7> yzen - to do this properly it sounds like this would require the "pouches" system hypothesised for model relay ....
2013-12-12T21:11:18 <Bosmon7> Where are you thinking of keeping it, specifically?
2013-12-12T21:11:36 <Bosmon7> Would it be problematic if it were kept in the main document, or might there be a need to keep it elsewhere?
2013-12-12T21:11:37 <yzen> Bosmon7: exactly where it is in the solutions registry
2013-12-12T21:12:29 <Bosmon7> yzen - can you be more specific :)
2013-12-12T21:12:38 <yzen> sure
2013-12-12T21:12:38 <Bosmon7> Clearly it will always be where it is in the solutions registry......
2013-12-12T21:12:45 <Bosmon7> Since you aren\'t planning to delete it from there :)
2013-12-12T21:12:54 <yzen> so the transformer currently just deletes it from the settingsHandlers block in solutions entry
2013-12-12T21:13:26 <yzen> i want to avoid that step so it is not deleted from the matched solutions block that is returned by the match maker
2013-12-12T21:13:28 <yzen> that\'s all
2013-12-12T21:13:36 <yzen> i don\'t actually want to delete anything anywhere :)
2013-12-12T21:13:39 <Bosmon7> I guess when I say "where" I mean, "in what document at what stage of the pipeline and at what location"
2013-12-12T21:14:48 <Bosmon7> Ok - so would there be an issue with retaining it in the document after transformation?
2013-12-12T21:14:58 <Bosmon7> Might it confuse some of the consumers of the document?
2013-12-12T21:16:27 <yzen> Bosmon7: that is exactly my initial comment as i never touched the transformer myself, and the consumer is the lifecycle manager that you wrote :)
2013-12-12T21:16:36 <yzen> question, not comment
2013-12-12T21:16:53 <Bosmon7> ok
2013-12-12T21:17:06 <Bosmon7> Well, I\'m sure you\'ve touched the lifecycleManager more recently than me :)
2013-12-12T21:17:16 <yzen> Bosmon7: or in other words, if you can\'t think why not i can try myself and see what happens
2013-12-12T21:17:47 <Bosmon7> Well, we might try thinking about it first :)
2013-12-12T21:17:57 <yzen> sure
2013-12-12T21:22:01 <yzen> so what do you think :) ?
2013-12-12T21:22:03 <yzen> Bosmon7: ^
2013-12-12T21:22:24 <Bosmon7> Yes - just trying to get my Eclipse open in this machine again :)
2013-12-12T21:24:56 <Bosmon7> I wonder how the univeral repo can have got 85MB bigger in a few months
2013-12-12T21:26:32 <Bosmon7> I guess we once had all of connect committed as a concrete submodule ...
2013-12-12T21:27:48 <yzen> Bosmon7: i believe it\'s the pilot branch
2013-12-12T21:28:02 <Bosmon7> What is the bulk in that?
2013-12-12T21:32:08 <yzen> some java stuff no ?
2013-12-12T21:32:54 <Bosmon7> dear oh dear
2013-12-12T21:33:13 <colinclark> lol
2013-12-12T21:33:18 <Bosmon7> Anyway, yes, at first pass, the idea of not deleting "capabilities" seems reasonable
2013-12-12T21:33:39 <colinclark> I believe, when I wrote the original Transformer, I was just deleting it for convenience
2013-12-12T21:33:43 <colinclark> it seemed irrelevant to the client
2013-12-12T21:33:49 <yzen> GOOD :)
2013-12-12T21:36:18 <colinclark> So tell me again why you need it to live?
2013-12-12T21:36:28 <colinclark> or which components need it to live?
2013-12-12T21:38:13 <yzen> colinclark:
2013-12-12T21:38:14 <yzen> so
2013-12-12T21:38:34 <yzen> here\'s what happens when pmt wants to update something
2013-12-12T21:38:59 <yzen> preferences -> solution (1 or more capabilities) -> applied with success or error or need restart
2013-12-12T21:39:44 <yzen> the framework needs to let the pmt know what prefs were applied successfully, or not or which require restart of the solution
2013-12-12T21:40:03 <yzen> the reverse conversion from solutions to preferences is not 1-1
2013-12-12T21:40:06 <yzen> colinclark: ^
2013-12-12T21:40:11 <yzen> so what i need to do is
2013-12-12T21:40:47 <yzen> solution id -> know capabilities(prefs) -> filter the prefs based on the ones presented by the user

2013-12-12T16:09:09 <kasparnet> colinclark: hey dr. clarkster
2013-12-12T16:09:21 <colinclark> I was thinking...
2013-12-12T16:09:25 <kasparnet> oh oh
2013-12-12T16:09:27 <colinclark> lol
2013-12-12T16:09:28 <colinclark> yes
2013-12-12T16:09:29 <colinclark> I know
2013-12-12T16:09:31 <kasparnet> hehe
2013-12-12T16:09:35 <colinclark> Claudia\'s MM summary email was very helpful
2013-12-12T16:10:00 <colinclark> Should we try to schedule our first "special topic architecture meeting" next week?
2013-12-12T16:10:04 <colinclark> On the topic of Matchmaking?
2013-12-12T16:12:32 <colinclark> kasparnet: ^
2013-12-12T16:12:54 <colinclark> Or will Friday\'s meeting be better for that?
2013-12-12T16:14:01 <kasparnet> colinclark: ugh - I keep thinking we should do that.. I got another mail from her a while back (that I should forward to you) talking about the role of the RB MM, which was quite close to our discussion in Madrid
2013-12-12T16:14:15 <colinclark> Oh cool
2013-12-12T16:14:31 <colinclark> I think we also really need to talk through the direction of the Statistical Matchmaker with Andy
2013-12-12T16:14:38 * sgithens joined the channel
2013-12-12T16:14:40 <kasparnet> yeah
2013-12-12T16:14:48 <colinclark> since it sounds like he\'s opened up a massive security hole with the current implementation
2013-12-12T16:14:57 <colinclark> If I\'m understanding it a correctly
2013-12-12T16:15:00 <kasparnet> yup
2013-12-12T16:15:00 <colinclark> and I don\'t want to presume
2013-12-12T16:15:22 <kasparnet> colinclark: so part of Fridays MM meeting will be about MM integration for the review meeting
2013-12-12T16:15:42 <kasparnet> not sure if we should mix things up too much
2013-12-12T16:15:56 <kasparnet> so perhaps doing a dedicated special topic architecture meeting would be good
2013-12-12T16:16:43 <colinclark> Ok
2013-12-12T16:16:49 <colinclark> When do you think it makes sense to do so?
2013-12-12T16:16:51 <colinclark> sooner or later?
2013-12-12T16:16:56 <kasparnet> colinclark: I dont now if we should write something up more officially - ie. tweak the mail that I sent you and Bosmon a while back
2013-12-12T16:17:01 <kasparnet> (I can resend it)
2013-12-12T16:17:06 <colinclark> yeah, send it me again
2013-12-12T16:17:11 <colinclark> sorry I missed it
2013-12-12T16:17:20 <kasparnet> well - I\'m tempted to want everything to happen later, but it\'s probably good if it would happen sooner
2013-12-12T16:17:23 <colinclark> I\'m getting back on top of email these days
2013-12-12T16:17:25 <kasparnet> so next week sometime
2013-12-12T16:18:30 <kasparnet> colinclark, sgithens: I missed you at the architecture meeting yesterday, btw... I was all prepared to go on a long rant about the importance of reviewing pull requests, etc
2013-12-12T16:18:41 <kasparnet> the three of us have a depressingly long list
2013-12-12T16:19:02 <sgithens> I mentioned your epic pull list last night during Whow
2013-12-12T16:19:04 <sgithens> Who
2013-12-12T16:19:13 <sgithens> and suggested we stay up all night merging pull requests
2013-12-12T16:19:20 <kasparnet> haha
2013-12-12T16:19:27 <sgithens> however...
2013-12-12T16:19:30 <sgithens> we fell asleep
2013-12-12T16:19:40 <kasparnet> hahaha, that\'s fair enough
2013-12-12T16:19:44 <kasparnet> what\'s Who?
2013-12-12T16:19:52 <sgithens> I\'m not going to campus tomorrow either, so hopefully I\'ll do some tomorrow
2013-12-12T16:19:54 <kasparnet> I know the band, and the world health organization
2013-12-12T16:19:58 <sgithens> THER DOCTOR
2013-12-12T16:20:02 <kasparnet> ahhhh, ofc
2013-12-12T16:20:07 <kasparnet> how could I be so ignorant
2013-12-12T16:20:20 <kasparnet> antranique would\'ve killed me if he saw that
2013-12-12T16:20:50 <sgithens> the take home message is,  I channeled your rant
2013-12-12T16:21:04 <sgithens> and distilled it\'s essence deep into my bones
2013-12-12T16:21:37 <kasparnet> haha, awesome! Thanks sgithens
2013-12-12T16:22:12 <colinclark> I have no room in bones for kasparnet\'s message
2013-12-12T16:22:19 <sgithens> We also chatted about windows 64 bit a lot at dinner
2013-12-12T16:22:24 <sgithens> and windows in general
2013-12-12T16:22:39 <sgithens> we\'re so excited to stabilize the heck out of it
2013-12-12T16:22:53 <kasparnet> sgithens: are you in wisconsin?
2013-12-12T16:22:58 <sgithens> I am
2013-12-12T16:23:04 <kasparnet> ahhhhh - it all makes sense
2013-12-12T16:23:06 <sgithens> In this meeting
2013-12-12T16:23:09 <sgithens> hahahahhaahhaa
2013-12-12T16:23:16 <kasparnet> sgithens, colinclark: are you sitting right next to each other?
2013-12-12T16:23:20 <sgithens> we are
2013-12-12T16:23:24 <colinclark> yes
2013-12-12T16:23:59 <colinclark> We are paying rapt attention to the current presentation about how the GPII architecture works
2013-12-12T16:24:01 <colinclark> :P
2013-12-12T16:24:12 <sgithens> I am flanked by Clark and Professor Professor Basman
2013-12-12T16:25:03 <kasparnet> man I\'m so envious
2013-12-12T16:25:09 <kasparnet> I wanna be there as well
2013-12-12T16:25:18 <kasparnet> "team \'murica"
2013-12-12T16:25:24 <sgithens> Tobias just quoted Devo
2013-12-12T16:28:48 <colinclark> Bosmon: Do you exist here?
2013-12-12T17:06:46 <colinclark> yzen: I think the Matchmaker type preference should be like any other preference in a set
2013-12-12T17:07:04 <colinclark> we can define a common term, perhaps called, "preferredMatchmaker"
2013-12-12T17:07:27 <colinclark> and bind it to a standard type name
2013-12-12T17:07:44 <colinclark> if that makes sense
2013-12-12T17:20:07 * michelled has quit
2013-12-12T17:23:49 <sgithens> we answer to The Infrastructure
2013-12-12T17:23:57 <sgithens> (ie. Colin)
2013-12-12T17:24:18 * kasparnet has quit
2013-12-12T18:13:28 <yzen> colinclark: good point, ill make a change
2013-12-12T18:13:44 <colinclark> cool, thanks
2013-12-12T18:13:50 <colinclark> any ideas how we could test this?
2013-12-12T18:13:53 <yzen> colinclark: what happens if it\'s not there?
2013-12-12T18:13:54 * michelled joined the channel
2013-12-12T18:14:03 <colinclark> if the matchmaker isn\'t there? Or the preference?
2013-12-12T18:14:08 <yzen> mock something up i think
2013-12-12T18:14:14 <colinclark> yeah
2013-12-12T18:14:36 <colinclark> I assume we should be able to write a test that feeds a particular preference in and asserts that we the correct component grade
2013-12-12T18:14:44 <colinclark> or, I guess, this is just a single proxy
2013-12-12T18:14:49 <colinclark> that looks up to some configuration
2013-12-12T18:14:58 <colinclark> with things like the URL to a remote MM
2013-12-12T18:15:18 <colinclark> We should have some kind of default system-wide if the user doesn\'t have a preference for a particular MM
2013-12-12T18:15:28 <colinclark> soon enough, it should be the canopy
2013-12-12T18:15:31 <colinclark> the default
2013-12-12T18:15:34 <colinclark> but for now, flat
2013-12-12T18:16:08 <yzen> colinclark: ya ill keep it flat i for now i guess
