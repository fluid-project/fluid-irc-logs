2013-11-05T17:41:23 <yzen> hey colinclark
2013-11-05T17:41:32 <yzen> do you use dynamicComponents in flocking ?
2013-11-05T17:59:02 <colinclark> yzen: Yes, I use them in a particular instrument with Flocking
2013-11-05T17:59:16 <yzen> colinclark: is it in a branch or master ?
2013-11-05T17:59:58 <colinclark> Neither
2013-11-05T17:59:59 <colinclark> one sec
2013-11-05T18:00:37 <colinclark> https://github.com/colinbdclark/compositions/blob/05f183cb0872f84eee146c7c018e4d8e1a59ec24/leap-grains/js/leap-grains.js#L150-L233
2013-11-05T18:00:49 <colinclark> This is an instrument designed to be used with the Leap Motion controller
2013-11-05T18:01:02 <yzen> colinclark: actually i think i found the tests in the framework that do just what i need, but ill check it out thanks
2013-11-05T18:01:10 <colinclark> when the Leap component fires "onPointableAdded," new Synth components get created accordingly
2013-11-05T18:01:14 <yzen> {arguments} is what i needed :)
2013-11-05T18:01:17 <yzen> thanks
2013-11-05T18:01:24 <colinclark> unfortunately there are no formal semantics for destruction of dynamic components
2013-11-05T18:01:42 <colinclark> https://github.com/colinbdclark/compositions/blob/05f183cb0872f84eee146c7c018e4d8e1a59ec24/leap-grains/js/leap-grains.js#L137-L144
2013-11-05T18:01:52 <colinclark> So I do it by hand, awkwardly
2013-11-05T18:01:59 <colinclark> https://github.com/colinbdclark/compositions/blob/05f183cb0872f84eee146c7c018e4d8e1a59ec24/leap-grains/js/leap-grains.js#L324-L335
2013-11-05T18:02:03 <colinclark> Anyway, that\'s it :)
2013-11-05T18:04:45 <yzen> :) thanks!

2013-11-05T20:42:24 <anastasiac> yzen, where are UISpecs stored in cspace? for example, how could i see the UISpec for, say, "Person" ?
2013-11-05T20:42:52 <yzen> https://github.com/collectionspace/ui/tree/master/src/test/uispecs
2013-11-05T20:43:04 <yzen> this are test ones though, real ones are generated by the app layer
2013-11-05T20:43:52 <anastasiac> ah, real ones generated by the app layer. ok, that explains it, thanks

2013-11-05T21:12:24 <anastasiac> yzen, are uischema and uispec different things? or just different names for the same thing?
2013-11-05T21:12:38 <yzen> different things
2013-11-05T21:12:50 <yzen> uispec is the renderer tree
2013-11-05T21:12:53 * clown_mtg has quit
2013-11-05T21:13:00 <yzen> uischema is the json schema for record data
