2013-11-22T18:47:44 * mrvisser has quit
2013-11-22T18:56:11 <Bosmon> Hi, yzen
2013-11-22T18:56:13 * cindyli has quit
2013-11-22T18:56:27 * cindyli joined the channel
2013-11-22T18:56:28 <yzen> Bosmon: hi, I\'m wondering about the new demands
2013-11-22T18:56:35 <Bosmon> yzen - cool
2013-11-22T18:56:47 <yzen> i m currently dealing with gradeNames of the exact component
2013-11-22T18:56:54 <Bosmon> Yes
2013-11-22T18:57:08 <yzen> what about the context that is in the parent components up the tree
2013-11-22T18:57:11 <Bosmon> There are still some questions to be answered about that, yes
2013-11-22T18:57:28 <Bosmon> In the call yesterday, I suggested that we might split off that part of the work to be handled by what we currently call "progressiveEnhancement"
2013-11-22T18:57:51 <Bosmon> And rename it to something like "contextAwareness" or "contextMatching" or so
2013-11-22T18:57:56 <yzen> right
2013-11-22T18:58:07 * michelled joined the channel
2013-11-22T18:58:20 <yzen> I\'m just thinking of a case where i have an existing request handler
2013-11-22T18:58:22 <Bosmon> Since it already seems mostly suitable, and we do want our implementation to have as few redundant parts as possible
2013-11-22T18:58:24 <Bosmon> Cool
2013-11-22T18:58:35 <yzen> that i want to add a dynamic grade to
2013-11-22T18:58:53 <yzen> but the context grades are not within the component itself
2013-11-22T18:59:10 <yzen> rather within the parent
2013-11-22T18:59:17 <yzen> or ancestor
2013-11-22T18:59:25 <yzen> e.g. the kettle.server
2013-11-22T19:00:04 <Bosmon> Yes
2013-11-22T19:00:11 <Bosmon> Can you describe the case in more detail?
2013-11-22T19:00:15 <Bosmon> What are the grade names involved
2013-11-22T19:00:24 <Bosmon> Certainly the "use" system needs a kind of lookup for this kind of thing too
2013-11-22T19:02:12 <yzen> sure
2013-11-22T19:02:22 <yzen> so i can have a "session" grade on the server
2013-11-22T19:02:35 <yzen> now the login handler for flow manager in that case needs to add things to the session object
2013-11-22T19:02:42 <yzen> like device info
2013-11-22T19:02:55 <yzen> so if we make \'update\' requests we do not fetch it again
2013-11-22T19:04:04 * anvk has quit
2013-11-22T19:04:32 <Bosmon> So, it seems that we already added "some" session-aware grades to the request when it was created - otherwise it couldn\'t work
2013-11-22T19:04:46 <Bosmon> And so in theory we could just use the existing "new demands" system just to be aware of THOSE

2013-11-22T19:49:55 * anvk joined the channel
2013-11-22T19:50:58 <yzen> Bosmon: by THOSE do you mean the grades of ancestors
2013-11-22T19:51:00 <yzen> ?
2013-11-22T19:51:24 <Bosmon> yzen - I mean the existing session-related request grades that we have

2013-11-22T21:42:46 <Bosmon> yzen
2013-11-22T21:43:33 <yzen> Bosmon: so i did get into a situation where our dynamicGrade is resolving before other dynamic grades that are part of the context
2013-11-22T21:43:54 <Bosmon> yzen - this will certainly happen, yes
2013-11-22T21:44:01 <Bosmon> They can\'t really all resolve at the same moment : P
2013-11-22T21:44:09 <yzen> :yep
2013-11-22T21:44:56 <yzen> :(
2013-11-22T21:45:46 <Bosmon> Can you describe the situation, and why it is problematic?
2013-11-22T21:45:59 <Bosmon> In general it should be fine unless there is an "options race"
2013-11-22T21:46:08 <Bosmon> That is, one grade writes to an option that another one reads from
