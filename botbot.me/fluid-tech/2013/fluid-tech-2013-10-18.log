2013-10-18T18:15:46 <yzen> Bosmon:
2013-10-18T18:20:16 <yzen> Bosmon: so i m trying to figure out how to utilize a dynamic grades
2013-10-18T18:20:53 <yzen> I\'m trying to determine the grade dynamically based on whether the parent component has specific grades
2013-10-18T18:20:59 <yzen> so something like this
2013-10-18T18:21:07 <yzen> parent grade names : [a, b, c]
2013-10-18T18:21:40 <yzen> dynamic grade for the child is bb if b, aa if a (regardless if b is there)
2013-10-18T18:21:53 <Bosmon> That\'s interesting
2013-10-18T18:22:02 <Bosmon> I think it can be done, but can you explain the context of the problem?
2013-10-18T18:23:07 <yzen> sure
2013-10-18T18:23:16 <yzen> so i have a requests grade
2013-10-18T18:23:20 <yzen> that is used for both components
2013-10-18T18:23:40 <yzen> actually no scrap that
2013-10-18T18:23:49 <yzen> so i have a component
2013-10-18T18:23:59 <yzen> that can optionally have a contributed grade
2013-10-18T18:24:22 <yzen> now if it is contributed, i want its child dynamic grade to resolve to something else
2013-10-18T18:24:41 <Bosmon> Ok
2013-10-18T18:24:50 <Bosmon> But what is the actual situation :)
2013-10-18T18:24:57 <Bosmon> Is it to do with socket.io in kettle?
2013-10-18T18:27:13 * mrvisser_ joined the channel
2013-10-18T18:28:49 * mrvisser has quit
2013-10-18T18:29:07 <yzen> yes
2013-10-18T18:29:09 <yzen> so sure
2013-10-18T18:29:15 <yzen> we have a kettle.requests component
2013-10-18T18:29:28 <yzen> it creates request objects
2013-10-18T18:29:39 <yzen> but in for sockets and for http they are different things
2013-10-18T18:29:53 <yzen> so i have 2 components kettle.requests.io and kettle.requests.http
2013-10-18T18:30:17 <yzen> by default kettle.requests is actually kettle.requets.http
2013-10-18T18:30:45 <yzen> but i can drop in a kettle.requests.io as a grade into it
2013-10-18T18:30:47 <yzen> if i do
2013-10-18T18:30:47 <Bosmon> Yes, it\'s probably about the time to have our conversation about how the kettle request grades work in any case :)
2013-10-18T18:32:18 <Bosmon> It sounds like "requests" is a static grade - that is, it lives as long as the application?
2013-10-18T18:32:32 <Bosmon> And that there are corresponding request grades, just good for 1 request
2013-10-18T18:32:37 <Bosmon> What is the correspondence between their names?
2013-10-18T18:32:44 <Bosmon> And how does this relate to the kettle.use* names?
2013-10-18T18:34:10 <yzen> yse
2013-10-18T18:34:12 <yzen> so
2013-10-18T18:34:17 <yzen> it\'s not related to kettle.use
2013-10-18T18:34:49 <yzen> so yes
2013-10-18T18:34:54 <yzen> requests lives forever
2013-10-18T18:35:03 <yzen> request is only for a request or a socket connection
2013-10-18T18:36:13 <Bosmon> So how are kettle.requests.http and kettle.requests.io intended to be used?
2013-10-18T18:36:14 <yzen> so kettle.requests is used for kettle.requests.http and kettle.requests.io which in turn should be creating kettle.requests.http.requet and kettle.requests.io.request
2013-10-18T18:36:19 <Bosmon> ok
2013-10-18T18:36:34 <Bosmon> And how are they configured by the user?
2013-10-18T18:38:38 <Bosmon> And.... isn\'t it the case that we require some kind of "session" support, given that we imagine that some of the io requests will be correlated with some of the http requests?
2013-10-18T18:38:53 <Bosmon> Is this just going to be achieved by callback wrapping, or some other scheme?
2013-10-18T18:40:31 <yzen> Bosmon: sure, but we do not deal with the session just yet
2013-10-18T18:41:53 <Bosmon> ok
2013-10-18T18:42:28 <yzen> ok anyways i know how to go about it
2013-10-18T18:42:33 <yzen> not to complicate things
