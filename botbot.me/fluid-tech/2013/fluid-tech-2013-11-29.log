2013-11-29T10:10:44 <the-t-in-rtf> Morning peeps.  I am working to build a new page using fluid components, and am a bit confused about this page:  http://wiki.fluidproject.org/x/bKQPAg
2013-11-29T10:10:56 <the-t-in-rtf> It says that the skinning system will be removed in 1.5?
2013-11-29T10:13:02 <the-t-in-rtf> The 1.5 release page is not shining that much light on the subject: http://wiki.fluidproject.org/x/sYboAQ
2013-11-29T10:13:49 <the-t-in-rtf> OK, found confirmation here:  http://wiki.fluidproject.org/x/npZBAg
2013-11-29T10:14:02 <the-t-in-rtf> My question is, is there anything we use instead?

2013-11-29T13:37:56 <the-t-in-rtf> OK, I am now working with the fluid pager.  I can\'t get it to fill a column with a link.  It puts in the text, but doesn\'t make it into a link.
2013-11-29T13:38:13 <the-t-in-rtf> I suspect this page is missing something about the type of a specified component:  http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/docs/Pager+API#PagerAPI-OptionsfortheData-drivenPager
2013-11-29T13:38:56 <the-t-in-rtf> Here\'s the sample code:
2013-11-29T13:38:56 <the-t-in-rtf> {key: "user-link",
2013-11-29T13:38:57 <the-t-in-rtf> \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0valuebinding: "*.userDisplayName",\xc2\xa0

2013-11-29T13:38:57 <the-t-in-rtf> \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0target: "/dev/sn/profile.html?user=${*.userId}",
2013-11-29T13:38:57 <the-t-in-rtf> \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0linktext: fluid.VALUE},

2013-11-29T13:38:58 <the-t-in-rtf> \xc2\xa0}
2013-11-29T13:39:16 <the-t-in-rtf> Here\'s my entry:
2013-11-29T13:39:17 <the-t-in-rtf> {
2013-11-29T13:39:17 <the-t-in-rtf> key: "entry-actions",
2013-11-29T13:39:17 <the-t-in-rtf> valuebinding: "*.value._id",
2013-11-29T13:39:17 <the-t-in-rtf> components: {
2013-11-29T13:39:17 <the-t-in-rtf> target: "/_utils/document.html?tr/${*.value._id}",
2013-11-29T13:39:18 <the-t-in-rtf> linktext: "View/Edit"
2013-11-29T13:39:18 <the-t-in-rtf> },
2013-11-29T13:39:19 <the-t-in-rtf> sortable: false
2013-11-29T13:39:19 <the-t-in-rtf> }
2013-11-29T13:39:50 <the-t-in-rtf> The text shows up, but it\'s not created as a link.

2013-11-29T13:51:03 <the-t-in-rtf> Do I need anything special in the markup that is being worked on?

2013-11-29T14:12:24 <the-t-in-rtf> Are there any other examples of using the pager other than the demo?
2013-11-29T14:12:35 <the-t-in-rtf> I also need to be able to handle a list of things as a column value
2013-11-29T14:12:38 <the-t-in-rtf> and for those to be links
2013-11-29T14:15:15 <the-t-in-rtf> While I am throwing questions out there, has anyone got lucene working with couchdb on a mac?
