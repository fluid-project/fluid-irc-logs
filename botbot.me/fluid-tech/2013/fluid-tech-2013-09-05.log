2013-09-05T16:43:01 <yzen> colinclark, kasparnet I wanted to run something by you
2013-09-05T16:43:17 <colinclark> ok
2013-09-05T16:44:53 <yzen> so in case of the cloud based flow manager , how would it communicate to the device reporter ?
2013-09-05T16:45:05 <yzen> my understanding is that the device reporter is on the client
2013-09-05T16:45:33 <yzen> the user would attempt to log in to the cloud based matchmaker similarly to how it already does e.g. with a token
2013-09-05T16:45:57 <yzen> any thoughts on how the flow manager would get the device information in order to be able to communicate to the match maker
2013-09-05T16:46:02 <yzen> sorry if I\'m missing smth bth
2013-09-05T16:46:05 <yzen> btw
2013-09-05T16:48:18 <yzen> colinclark: kasparnet ^
2013-09-05T16:49:10 <colinclark> Your question is a good one, yzen.
2013-09-05T16:49:51 <colinclark> For our first iteration, I think we\'re going to assume that the device\'s capabilities aren\'t particularly relevant in this scenario
2013-09-05T16:49:58 <colinclark> since a web app is "device neutral"
2013-09-05T16:50:18 <colinclark> in reality, this is pretty naive.
2013-09-05T16:50:34 <yzen> colinclark: the thing is that the match maker is not device neutral afaik
2013-09-05T16:50:54 <colinclark> In this context, I think it has to
2013-09-05T16:51:23 <colinclark> I remember on one of the evenings in the San Diego zen house we talked about how we would need some connection, perhaps via a browser plugin, with the native device
2013-09-05T16:51:37 <colinclark> to avoid cases, for example, where we would make the text size too large because it had been "doubly applied"
2013-09-05T16:51:53 <colinclark> Presumably for now, however, there should be a "device" that represents the web
2013-09-05T16:52:09 <kasparnet> yeah, I think that makes sense as well
2013-09-05T16:52:20 <yzen> colinclark: so i was thinking web sockets?
2013-09-05T16:52:31 <colinclark> yzen: Yes, it\'s a pretty good possibility
2013-09-05T16:52:50 <colinclark> Having played now a fair bit with my Leap Motion controller, I\'m realizing how smooth web sockets can be for this kind of use case
2013-09-05T16:53:01 <colinclark> If you can look past the huge potential security risks, anyway
2013-09-05T16:53:03 <colinclark> :)
2013-09-05T16:53:13 <colinclark> I think it might be viable to have some basic "device" information synthesized in the browser
2013-09-05T16:53:18 <colinclark> and sent along to the web-based Flow Manager
2013-09-05T16:53:33 <colinclark> i.e. at least to pass along things like what browser the user is on
2013-09-05T16:53:34 <colinclark> etc.
2013-09-05T16:54:23 <yzen> colinclark: well, is the idea behind the cloud based match maker to work with web solutions ?
2013-09-05T16:54:36 <colinclark> yes
2013-09-05T16:54:44 <colinclark> That is our first use case
2013-09-05T16:54:58 <colinclark> we\'ll want to expand it to work for things like the Java "dumb" phones
2013-09-05T16:55:28 <colinclark> I suspect, ultimately, that we\'ll continue with a model where the Flow Manager will reside locally for most desktop/smartphone use cases
2013-09-05T16:55:40 <colinclark> but I\'m not averse to other approaches
2013-09-05T16:55:44 <colinclark> kasparnet, what\'s your impression?
2013-09-05T16:55:46 <yzen> so in order to have the browser information the user has to make the request directly, or the app has to pass that information to the flow manager, as far as i understand in most cases the app will make the request on behalf of the user ?
2013-09-05T16:56:07 <colinclark> I think the latter case, yes
2013-09-05T16:56:38 <kasparnet> yeah, the latter
2013-09-05T16:57:30 <kasparnet> and I agree, in most cases we want to (for now) assume that those devices capable of it (ie. everything but browser based solutions, smarthouses, bank app and javaphone) will run GPII locally
2013-09-05T16:57:58 <colinclark> is this seeming sensible and viable, yzen?
2013-09-05T16:58:13 <kasparnet> and I think it\'s sensible to have the app using the online flowmanager reporting the context/device in which it\'s being used
2013-09-05T16:58:41 <yzen> well are we talking about the api change ?
2013-09-05T16:58:42 <colinclark> We can make a little Node.js example for people to see or use
2013-09-05T16:58:50 <colinclark> how so?
2013-09-05T16:59:13 <yzen> e.g. user token + something like browser info ?
2013-09-05T16:59:18 <yzen> when you mentioned sending it along
2013-09-05T16:59:27 <colinclark> yes, I think that\'s the case
2013-09-05T17:00:11 <colinclark> One can imagine that the web-based Flow Manager is a reconfiguration of the desktop-based Flow Manager\'s workflow
2013-09-05T17:00:28 <yzen> yes
2013-09-05T17:00:30 <colinclark> i.e. aggregating several steps of the flow into one and removing a few others
2013-09-05T17:03:23 <colinclark> kasparnet: Just as a heads up that we\'re we\'re likely going to have a big GPII demo or two in October
2013-09-05T17:03:30 <kasparnet> ok
2013-09-05T17:03:30 <colinclark> focusing in particular on Windows platforms
2013-09-05T17:16:31 <kasparnet> colinclark: thanks for the heads up
2013-09-05T17:16:53 <kasparnet> it\'s gonna be nice to have some motivation to set up a nice demo config as well
2013-09-05T17:21:02 <colinclark> and an installer
2013-09-05T17:21:10 <colinclark> and all that polish
